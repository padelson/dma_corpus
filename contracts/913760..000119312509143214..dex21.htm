ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

SECTION 1.1  _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the

merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation.
The Company, as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL (the
" _Certificate of Merger_ ") shall be duly executed by the Company and,
concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall
become effective upon the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other
date and time as Parent and the Company may mutually agree and include in the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

SECTION 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effects of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all of the rights, privileges, powers and franchises of each of
the Company and Merger Sub, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and
all debts due to each of the Company and Merger Sub on whatever account
(including stock subscriptions and all other things in action) or belonging to
each of such corporations shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.4 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such
corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. 



 

-2- SECTION 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such
Certificate of Incorporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Company shall be the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL
and as provided in such Bylaws.

(c) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the
Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, or as
otherwise provided by applicable law.

(d) Immediately following the Effective Time, the members of the Board of
Directors of Parent will be determined as set forth on _Exhibit C_ and will
serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal and until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.
Immediately following the Effective Time, the individuals set forth on
_Exhibit C_ will have the offices at Parent as set forth therein, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal and until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. In addition, certain other
matters with respect to the Parent at the Effective Time are set forth on
_Exhibit C_.

SECTION 1.6 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Merger Sub or the
Company:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 1.6(c)) will be converted into the right
to receive 0.2950 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of fully paid and
nonassessable Parent Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 1.6(a)_ shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

(b) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Subs common stock that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Merger
Sub Common Stock_ ") shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



 

-3- (c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Company
Common Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent
or Merger Sub or held in the treasury of the Company (other than shares held
on behalf of third parties) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.

(d) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that either the Company or
the Parent changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for such shares, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_
that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company or the Parent to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms
of this Agreement.

SECTION 1.7 _Share Exchange_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent
in the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
holders of Shares, the Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to Section
1.6(a) in exchange for issued and outstanding Shares in the Merger pursuant
to Section 1.6(a). Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent from
time to time, as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.10 and any dividends and other distributions
pursuant to Section 1.9. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash it so
receives, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

(b) At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of the Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of certificates representing ownership of the Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Certificates_ ") shall
cease to have rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable law. Merger Consideration issuable in the
Merger shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective Time. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or
Parent for any reason shall be converted into the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby, any
cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to Section 1.10 and any dividends or other distributions
to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 1.9 without
interest.



 

-4- (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Certificate(s), which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares, whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a) and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s) as required by Section
1.7(d)), and which letter shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.9. Upon (x) in the case of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by a Certificate, surrender of a Certificate to the
Exchange Agent, or (y) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in
book-entry form, the receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent, in
each case together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) the whole
number of shares of Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.6(a), and (B) a check in the amount equal to the
cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Sections 1.9 and
1.10 (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings from cash
payments), and in each case the Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
pursuant to Sections 1.9 or 1.10.

(d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
the Surviving Corporation may direct as to indemnify against any claim that
may be made against it, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby, and any cash that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Sections 1.9 or 1.10.

(e) If any share of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than
the name of the holder registered in the transfer records of the Company for
the corresponding Shares to be surrendered, it shall be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the
Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer (or, if the Shares are
held in book-entry form, there shall be proper evidence of such transfer or
exchange), and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate for Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Shares surrendered, or otherwise establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.



 

-5- SECTION 1.8 _Tax-Free Reorganization_. The Merger is intended to be a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this
Agreement is intended to be a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
the regulations promulgated under Section 368(a)(1) of the Code and for the
purpose of qualifying as a tax-free transaction for federal income tax
purposes. The parties hereto agree to report the Merger as a tax-free
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. None of the
parties hereto will take or cause to be taken any action, or omit to take any
action, that would prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

SECTION 1.9 _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of
such Certificate, and no cash payment that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this Agreement, including cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock, shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 1.10, until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with Section 1.7. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such
holder of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any
cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement, including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.10 and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

SECTION 1.10 _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_.

(a) No certificates representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Shares and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a shareholder of Parent or a holder of Parent Common Stock.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive from
Parent, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (x) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by (y) the Parent Common Stock Market Value.

SECTION 1.11 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration, any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto or any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered prior to two (2) years after the Effective Time  



 

-6-  (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration, any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such
Certificate or any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement, would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration, dividends
or distributions in respect thereof or such cash shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of
this Agreement shall thereafter look only to Parent only as general creditors
thereof for satisfaction of their claims for the payment of such Merger
Consideration, dividends or distributions in respect thereof or such cash
(without any interest thereon).

SECTION 1.12 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation, the Parent, and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Surviving Corporation
and/or the Parent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation
or the Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or
the Parent.

SECTION 1.13 _Stock Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, all outstanding and unexercised employee and
director options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a " _Company
Option_ ") will cease to represent an option to purchase Company Common Stock
and will be converted automatically into options to purchase Parent Common
Stock (" _Parent Options_ "), and Parent will assume each Company Option
subject to its terms; provided, however, that after the Effective Time: 

(i) The number of shares of Parent Common Stock that may be acquired upon
exercise of each Company Option will equal the product of (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that could have been acquired under the Company
Option immediately before the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole share; and

 

(ii) The per share exercise price for each Company Option will equal the
quotient of (x) the per share exercise price of the Company Option
immediately before the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down
to the nearest cent.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the exercise price and the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Options
shall be determined in a manner consistent with any applicable requirements of
Section 409A of the Code and (ii) in the case of any Company Option to which
Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined
in accordance with the foregoing,  



 

-7-  subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided
above, following the Effective Time, each Company Option shall continue to be
governed by the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting
requirements and any accelerated vesting thereof) as were applicable under
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving
effect to any rights resulting from the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement pursuant to the Company Option Plan and the award agreements
thereunder).

SECTION 1.14 _Time and Place of Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed
upon in writing by Parent and the Company, the closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") will be held at the offices of Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP,
Kansas City, Missouri, at 10:00 a.m., local time, no later than five business
days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of
the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing), unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties (the "
_Closing Date_ "). If the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ are satisfied
or waived during the two weeks immediately prior to the end of a fiscal
quarter of Parent, then Parent may postpone the Closing until the first full
week after the end of that fiscal quarter.

ARTICLE II

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT_

Except as set forth in (x) the Disclosure Schedule delivered by Parent to the
Company prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Schedule_ "), subject to _Section 8.15_, or in (y) any Parent SEC
Reports (as defined in  _Section 2.6(a)_) filed or furnished after September
30, 2006 and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement to the
extent any disclosure included therein would be readily apparent as an
exception to any representation or warranty contained herein, but excluding
any forward-looking statements contained in such Parent SEC Reports, Parent
hereby represents and warrants on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries to the
Company as follows:

SECTION 2.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries is a corporation or limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite corporate or
limited liability company power and authority necessary to own, possess,
license, operate or lease the properties that it purports to own, possess,
license, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where its business or the character of its properties owned,
possessed, licensed, operated or leased, or the nature of its activities,
makes such qualification necessary, except for any such failure which, when
taken together with all other such failures, would not result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the Company complete and
correct copies of the Parents and its Subsidiaries certificates of
incorporation and bylaws or comparable governing documents, each as amended
to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force and
effect. _Section 2.1_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule contains a correct
and complete list of each Subsidiary of Parent and of each jurisdiction where
Parent and its Subsidiaries are organized and qualified to do business.



 

-8- SECTION 2.2 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists
of (i) 17,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01, and (ii) 1,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Parent Preferred
Stock_ "). As of the date of this Agreement: (A) 9,106,009 shares of Parent
Common Stock were issued and outstanding; (B) 11,257 shares of Parent Common
Stock were held by Parent as treasury stock; (C) no shares of Parent Preferred
Stock were issued and outstanding; (D) 938,695 shares of Parent Common Stock
were reserved for grants of Parent Options under the Parent Option Plan; and
(E) all Parent Options were granted under the Parent Option Plan and not under
any other plan, program or agreement (other than any individual award
agreements made pursuant to the Parent Option Plan, forms of which have been
made available to the Company). The shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to the Parent Option Plan have been duly reserved for issuance by
Parent, and upon any issuance of such shares in accordance with the terms of
the Parent Option Plan, such shares will be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear from any preemptive or other
similar rights. All outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are, and all
shares which may be issued prior to the Effective Time will be when issued,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and
clear from any preemptive or other similar rights. Except as disclosed in
_Section 2.2_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are (i) no other
options, puts, calls, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements,
restrictions, or commitments of any character obligating Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, sell, redeem, repurchase or exchange any shares of
capital stock of or other equity interests in Parent or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock or other equity
interests, including restricted stock, restricted stock units and similar
securities, or any debt securities of Parent or to provide funds to or make
any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) and
(ii) no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to
vote on any matters on which stockholders of Parent may vote (whether or not
dependent on conversion or other trigger event). Except as disclosed in
_Section 2.2_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no existing
registration covenants with respect to Parent Common Stock or any other
securities of Parent and its Subsidiaries. _Section 2.2_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of each Parent
Option outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, including the holder,
date of grant, exercise price, if applicable, vesting schedule and number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject thereto. No stockholder is a party to or
holds shares of Parent Common Stock bound by or subject to any voting
agreement, voting trust, proxy or similar arrangement to which Parent is also
a party. Each Parent Option was (A) granted in compliance with all applicable
Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the Parent Option Plan pursuant
to which it was issued, (B) has an exercise price per share of Parent Common
Stock equal to or greater than the fair market value of a share of Parent
Common Stock on the date of such grant, (C) has a grant date identical to the
date on which the Parent Board or compensation committee actually awarded such
Parent Option, and (D) qualifies for the tax and accounting treatment afforded
to such Parent Option in the Parents Tax Returns and the Parents financial
statements, respectively.

SECTION 2.3 _Subsidiaries_. Each Subsidiary of Parent is identified in 
_Section 2.3_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. All the outstanding equity
interests of each Subsidiary of Parent are owned by Parent, by another wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent or by Parent and another wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Parent, free and clear of all Liens except as set forth in _Section 2.3_
of the Parent  



 

-9-  Disclosure Schedule. All of the capital stock or other equity interests of
each Subsidiary of Parent has been duly authorized and is validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear from any preemptive or other
similar rights. There are no proxies or voting agreements with respect to any
shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any such Subsidiary.
Except as set forth in  _Section 2.3_ of Parent Disclosure Schedule and
except for the ownership of the Subsidiaries of Parent, neither Parent nor any
Subsidiary of Parent, directly or indirectly, owns, or has agreed to purchase
or otherwise acquire, the capital stock or other equity interests of, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such capital
stock or such equity interests of, any corporation, partnership, joint venture
or other entity.

SECTION 2.4 _Authority_. Parent has the requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval, to carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and the consummation by Parent of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent, and, subject to obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval, no other corporate action is necessary for the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, the performance by Parent of its
obligations hereunder or the consummation by Parent of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Parent and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent,

enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect,
relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) equitable remedies
of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief
may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before

Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent does not, and

2.5(b)_, result in any material breach of or constitute a material default (or
an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a material
default) under, or terminate or cancel or give to others any rights of
termination, acceleration or cancellation of (with or without notice or lapse
of time or both), or result in the creation of a Lien, except for Parent
Permitted Liens, on any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Parent Material Contract, or (iii) subject to the requirements, filings,
consents and approvals referred to in _Section 2.5(b)_, violate any valid
and enforceable judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction, decree, Permit or
Laws applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their
respective properties are bound or subject except in the case of clause (ii),
as individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Except for applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities

delivery or performance of this Agreement by Parent and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Schedule, Parent has timely filed or furnished, as applicable, all forms,

October 1, 2006 (collectively with all forms, reports, statements, documents,
proxy statements and exhibits filed or furnished subsequent to the date
of this Agreement, and any amendments thereto, the " _Parent SEC Reports_ ").
The Parent SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects, or, if not yet
filed or furnished, will comply, as of their respective dates of filing
with the SEC, with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not

applicable, or, if not yet filed or furnished, will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except as
set forth in _Schedule 2.6(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, none of
Parents Subsidiaries is required to file any form, report, proxy statement or
other document with the SEC.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 2.6(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure

respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, and have been, and the consolidated financial

Agreement will be, prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of
unaudited consolidated quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under
the Exchange Act and except as may be indicated in the notes thereto)
consistently applied during the periods involved, and fairly present, and the
financial statements contained in the Parent SEC Reports filed after the date
of this Agreement will fairly present, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations and cash flows of Parent for the periods indicated, except in
the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements that were or are subject
to normal and recurring non-material year-end adjustments. Except as set forth
on _Section 2.6(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no material
off balance sheet arrangements, within the meaning of Item 303 of Regulation
S-K of the SEC, to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which any of its assets is bound which is not disclosed in the consolidated
financial statements contained in the Parent SEC Reports.



 

-11- (c) Except as set forth in _Section 2.6(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
and except for those liabilities and obligations that are reflected or
reserved against on the statement of financial condition dated September 30,
2008, contained in Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
September 30, 2008, or in the footnotes to such statement of financial
condition, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent, known, unknown or otherwise), except for (i)
liabilities or obligations incurred since September 30, 2008, in the Parents
Ordinary Course of Business, none of which has had or is likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii) liabilities for fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) obligations specifically set forth in this Agreement and (iv)
liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, are immaterial to the
financial condition or operating results of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by Parent is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and
other public disclosure documents. Parent maintains internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable,
under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is
effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent,
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of Parent are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of Parent, and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Parents assets that could have a material
effect on its financial statements. Parent has disclosed, based on the most
recent evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief financial
officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parents auditors and the
audit committee of the Parent Board (A) any significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and has identified for
Parents auditors and audit committee of the Parent Board any material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal control over financial reporting.
Parent has made available to the Company (i) a summary of any such disclosure
made by management to Parents auditors and audit committee since October 1,
2006, and (ii) any communication since October 1, 2006, made by management or
Parents auditors to the audit committee required or contemplated by the audit
committees charter or the professional standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board. Since October 1, 2006, no material complaints
from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing
matters, and no concerns from Parent employees regarding questionable
accounting or  



 

-12-  auditing matters, have been received by Parent. Parent has made available to
the Company a summary of all complaints or concerns relating to other
matters made since October 1, 2006, through Parents whistleblower hot-line
or equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding possible
violations of Law. No attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or
similar violation by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to Parents chief legal officer, audit committee (or other committee
designated for the purpose) of the Parent Board or the Parent Board pursuant
to the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any
Parent policy contemplating such reporting, including in instances not
required by those rules.

(e) Parent has devised and maintained systems of internal accounting controls
that are sufficient to be in compliance, in all material respects, with
applicable Laws.

(f) Parent has heretofore furnished the Company with its Regulatory
Accounting Reports and Regulatory Accounting Reports filed by any Subsidiary
after October 1, 2006 and prior to the date hereof.

SECTION 2.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since September 30, 2008,
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth in _Section
2.7_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there has not been:

(a) any effect, change, fact, event, occurrence or circumstance that,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect; or

(b) any event, action or occurrence taken on or prior to the date hereof,
that, if taken after the date hereof without the consent of the Company,
would violate any of the provisions of Section 4.2.

SECTION 2.8 _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in _Section 2.8_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, there are no material claims, actions, suits,
arbitrations, grievances, proceedings or investigations (collectively "
_Proceedings_ ") pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
rights, or any of their respective officers or directors in their capacity as
such, before any Governmental Entity, nor any internal investigations (other
than investigations in the ordinary course of Parents or any of its
Subsidiaries compliance programs) being conducted by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries nor have any acts of alleged misconduct by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries been reported to Parent. Except as disclosed in _Section 2.8_ of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any of their respective properties is subject to any order,
judgment, injunction or decree of any Governmental Entity material to the
conduct of the businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 2.9  _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) _Section 2.9(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
all employee welfare benefit plans (as defined in _Section 3(1)_ of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")),
employee pension benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and all
other employment, compensation, consulting, bonus, stock option, restricted
stock grant,  



 

-13-  stock purchase, other cash or stock-based incentive, profit sharing,
savings, retirement, disability, insurance, severance, termination, retention,
vacation, deferred compensation and other similar fringe or employee benefit
plans, programs, policies, agreements or arrangements sponsored, maintained,
contributed to or required to be contributed to, or entered into by Parent or
any other entity, whether or not incorporated, that together with Parent
would be deemed a "single employer" for purposes of Section 414 of the Code or
Section 4001 of ERISA (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") for the benefit of, or
relating to, any current or former employee, director or other independent
contractor of, or consultant to, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to which
Parent or any Subsidiary has any liability (together, the " _Parent Employee
Plans_ "). Section 2.9(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule separately lists
each Parent Employee Plan that is maintained outside of the United States
primarily for the benefit of employees working outside of the United States
(each, a " _Non-U.S. Parent Employee Plan_ ").

(b) Parent has made available to the Company true and complete copies of (i)
all Parent Employee Plans, together with all amendments thereto, (ii) the
latest Internal Revenue Service determination letters obtained with respect to
any Parent Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) or
501(a) of the Code, (iii) the two most recent annual actuarial valuation
reports, if any, (iv) the two most recently filed Forms 5500 together with all
related schedules, if any, (v) the "summary plan description" (as defined in
ERISA), if any, and all modifications thereto communicated to employees, (vi)

annual and periodic accountings of related plan assets.

(c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or agents has, with respect to any
Parent Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any "prohibited
transaction"(as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA),
which could result in the imposition of either a penalty assessed pursuant
to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in
each case applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent
Employee Plan except for any penalty or Tax that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(d) All Parent Employee Plans have been approved and administered in
accordance with their terms and are in compliance in all material respects
with the currently applicable requirements prescribed by all statutes, orders,
or governmental rules or regulations currently in effect with respect to such
Parent Employee Plans, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code. All
Parent Employee Plans providing deferred compensation or benefits subject to
Section 409A of the Code were, between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008,
operated in compliance with the plans terms, to the extent consistent with
Section 409A, and the applicable guidance issued by the Internal Revenue
Service and the Department of the Treasury, including Notice 2005-1, and to
the extent an issue was not addressed in Notice 2005-1 or other applicable
guidance, each applicable Parent Employee Plan was operated between January 1,
2005 and December 31, 2008 by applying reasonable, good faith interpretation
of Section 409A of the Code.



 

-14- (e) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened material
claims, lawsuits or arbitrations (other than routine claims for benefits),
relating to any of the Parent Employee Plans, or the assets of any trust for
any Parent Employee Plan.

(f) Each Parent Employee Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code, and the trusts created thereunder intended to be exempt from tax under
the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code, either (i) has received either
a favorable determination letter or is covered by a favorable opinion letter
from the Internal Revenue Service to such effect or (ii) is still within the
"remedial amendment period," as described in Section 401(b) of the Code and
the regulations thereunder.

(g) All contributions or payments required to be made or accrued before the
Effective Time under the terms of any Parent Employee Plan will have been made
by the Effective Time and all obligations in respect of each Parent Employee
Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the Parents financial
statements. 

(h) Except as set forth in Section 2.9(h) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
neither Parent nor any of its ERISA Affiliates contributes, nor within the
six-year period ending on the date hereof has any of them contributed or been
obligated to contribute, to any Pension Plan. No notice of a "reportable
event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the reporting
requirement has not been waived or extended, other than pursuant to Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") Reg. Section 4043.33 or 4043.66,
has been required to be filed by Parent for any Pension Plan or by an ERISA
Affiliate of Parent within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof or
will be required to be filed by Parent in connection with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. No notices have been required to be sent
by Parent to participants and beneficiaries or the PBGC under Section 302 or
4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither any Pension Plan nor any
single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate of Parent has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate of Parent has an
outstanding funding waiver. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer
plan of an ERISA Affiliate of Parent has been required to file information
pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently completed
plan year. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is
required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer
plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. Except
as set forth in Section 2.9(h) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, under each
Pension Plan of Parent or of its Subsidiaries which is a single-employer
plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date
hereof, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities",
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the
basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such Pension Plans most
recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the
assets of such Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the
financial condition, whether or not as a result of a change in the funding
method, of such Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year.

(i) Except as set forth in _Section 2.9(i)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, no Parent Employee Plan provides medical,
surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured)
for employees or former employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for
periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service,
other than coverage mandated by applicable Law.



 

15 (j) Except as set forth in _Section 2.9(j)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
or as may be prohibited by applicable Law, no condition exists that would
prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any
Parent Employee Plan providing health or medical benefits in respect of any
active employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with such
Parent Employee Plans terms.

(k) Except as set forth in _Section 2.9(k)(i)_ through _(v)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with any other event, (i)
entitle any current or former employee, director or officer of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any other payment or benefit, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee, director or officer, (iii) require Parent
to place in trust or otherwise set aside any amounts in respect of severance
pay or any other payment or benefit, (iv) limit or restrict the right of
Parent, its Subsidiaries or, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Surviving Corporation to merge, amend or terminate
any of the Parent Employee Plans, or (v) result in payments under any of the
Parent Employee Plans which would not be deductible under Section 280G of the
Code.

(l) All Non-U.S. Parent Employee Plans comply in all material respects with

lease and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where its business or the character of its properties owned, possessed,
licensed, operated or leased, or the nature of its activities, makes such
qualification necessary, except for any such failure which, when taken
together with all other such failures, would not result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of the Companys and its Subsidiaries certificates of
incorporation and Bylaws or comparable governing documents, each as amended
to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force and

or concerns relating to other matters made since September 1, 2006 through the
Companys whistleblower hot-line or equivalent system for receipt of employee

or governmental rules or regulations currently in effect with respect to such
Company Employee Plans, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code.
All Company Employee Plans providing deferred compensation or benefits subject
to Section 409A of the Code were, between January 1, 2005 and December
31, 2008, operated in compliance with the plans terms, to the extent
consistent with Section 409A, and the applicable guidance issued by the
Internal Revenue Service and the Department of the Treasury, including Notice

present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions
contained in such Pension Plans most recent actuarial valuation), did not

result of a change in the funding method, of such Pension Plan since the last
day of the most recent plan year.

for periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service,
other than coverage mandated by applicable Law.

Section 280G of the Code.

Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees, advisors, representatives and
agents not to, directly or indirectly, (i)  



 

-53-  solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of providing information),
or knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to,
or the making or completion of, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
provide or disclose any non-public information to any Person relating to the

Acquisition Proposal or (vi) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions
set forth in the preceding sentence by any of the Companys Subsidiaries or
any of the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries)
shall be a breach of this _Section 4.3(a)_ by the Company. The Company shall
promptly inform its advisors and representatives of the Companys obligations
under this _Section 4.3(a)_. The Company agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to any Company Acquisition Proposal (except with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). 

(b) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) upon receipt after the date hereof by it or its Subsidiaries or
representatives from any third party of any Company Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within two business
days) of the identity of such third party and provide a copy of such
Company Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where no
such copy is available, a description of the material terms and conditions of
such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request), including
any material modifications thereto. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a current basis (and in any event within five business days of the
occurrence of any changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the
status of any such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or
request (including the material terms and conditions thereof and of any
modification thereto), including furnishing copies of any written revised
proposals. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within five business days) notify Parent orally and in writing if it
determines to begin negotiations concerning a Company Superior Proposal
pursuant to Section 4.3(c). The Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is party to any agreement, which prohibits the Company from
providing such information to Parent.

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 4.3(a)_, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from, prior to the adoption of
this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock, engaging in any
discussions or negotiations with, or providing any non-public information to,
any Person, if and only to the extent that (i) the Company receives from such
 



 

-54-  Person a bona fide written Company Superior Proposal, or a Company
Acquisition Proposal, which was not solicited by the Company and did not
otherwise violate the provisions of _Section 4.3(b)_, and which the Company
Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and outside financial advisors) could reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Superior Proposal and (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to act on the Company Superior Proposal or Company
Acquisition Proposal, as the case may be, could be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Laws, (ii) prior to providing or disclosing any non-public information to any
Person in connection with such proposal, the Company Board receives from the
Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms no less restrictive on such Person than the terms
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that such confidentiality
agreement shall not be required to contain standstill provisions and shall
not contain any provisions that would prevent the Company from complying with
its obligation to provide the required disclosure to Parent pursuant to this
Section 4.3, and (iii) the Company concurrently discloses any such non-
public information to Parent if such non-public information has not been
disclosed previously to Parent.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a material
development or change in circumstances which occurs or arises after the date
of this Agreement (an " _Intervening Event_ "), that was not known by the
Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, the Company Board may, if it
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors)
that failure to do so could be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws, withdraw, modify or
change its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger (a " _Company
Change of Recommendation_ "), but only at a time that is after the
fifth business day following Parents receipt of written notice from the
Company advising Parent of its intention to do so; _provided_ that, if such
action is in response to or relates to a Company Acquisition Proposal, then
the Company Change of Recommendation shall be taken only in compliance with
_Section 4.3(e)_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in response
to a Company Acquisition Proposal which was not solicited by the Company or
otherwise in violation of _Section 4.3(a)_, if the Company Board concludes in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors)
that a Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal
and (after consultation with its legal advisors) that failure to do so could
be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Laws, the Company Board may at any time prior to
the Company Stockholder Approval (i) effect a Company Change of Recommendation
or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board may not effect such Company Change of Recommendation or
termination unless and until (i) five business days have elapsed following
delivery to Parent of a written notice of such determination by the Company
Board and of the material terms and conditions of the Company Acquisition
Proposal and the identity of the Person making the Company Acquisition
Proposal, and, during such five business day period, the Company reasonably
cooperates with Parent and Merger Sub with respect thereto with the intent of
enabling Parent and Merger Sub to agree to a modification of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the transactions contemplated hereby may
be effected and so that  



 

-55-  such Company Acquisition Proposal would no longer represent a Company
Superior Proposal, including negotiating in good faith with Parent and
its representatives with respect to any proposed revisions to the terms of
this Agreement, (ii) at the end of such five business day period, the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after considering the results of
such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that (A) in the case of a
Company Change of Recommendation, failure to take such action could be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Laws and (B) in the case of a termination of this
Agreement, that such Company Acquisition Proposal remains a Company Superior
Proposal as compared to the Merger, as supplemented by any counterproposals
made by Parent; _provided that_ , in the event the Company Board does not make
the determination referred to in this clause (ii) of this paragraph but
thereafter determines to effect a Company Change of Recommendation or
termination pursuant to this Section 4.3(e), the foregoing procedures shall
apply anew and shall also apply to any subsequent withdrawal, amendment or
modification, and (iii) contemporaneously with such termination, the Company
enters into a definitive acquisition, merger or similar agreement to effect
the Company Superior Proposal.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if the Company Board (after consultation with its
legal advisors), concludes that its failure to do so could be inconsistent
with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law; it being understood that any such disclosure that does not
reaffirm the Company Boards recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger
(and recommend that the Companys shareholders reject the applicable tender
offer or exchange offer within the ten day period specified by Rule 14d-9) or
which is otherwise adverse to Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a Company
Change of Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless and until this Agreement shall have
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall comply with
its obligations under _Section 5.2_ whether or not the Company Board makes a
Company Change of Recommendation or recommends any other offer or proposal.
Any action pursuant to and in accordance with _Sections 4.3(d),(e) or (f)_
shall not constitute a breach of the Companys representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

SECTION 4.4 _No Solicitation by Parent_. 

(a) Parent agrees that, prior to the Effective Time, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and each of its Subsidiaries
officers, directors, employees, advisors, representatives and agents not to,

of providing information), or knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals
or offers with respect to, or the making or completion of, any Parent
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) provide or disclose any non-public information to
any Person relating to the Parent or its Subsidiaries in connection with a
Parent Acquisition Proposal, participate or engage in any discussions or
negotiations concerning a Parent Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise take any

manner adverse to Company, (v) approve, recommend, endorse, agree to or
accept, or propose to approve, recommend, endorse, agree to or accept, or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement
related to any Parent Acquisition Proposal or (vi) resolve, propose or agree
to do any of the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of
the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any of the Parents
Subsidiaries or any of the Parents or the Parent Subsidiaries officers,
directors, employees, agents or representatives (including any investment
banker, attorney or accountant retained by Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries)
shall be a breach of this _Section 4.4(a)_ by Parent. Parent shall promptly
inform its advisors and representatives of Parents obligations under this
_Section 4.4(a)_. Parent agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal
(except with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(b) Parent shall notify the Company promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) upon receipt after the date hereof by it or its Subsidiaries or
representatives from any third party of any Parent Acquisition Proposal.
Parent shall notify the Company promptly (and in any event within two business
days) of the identity of such third party and provide a copy of such Parent
Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where no such copy
is available, a description of the material terms and conditions of such
Parent Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request), including any
material modifications thereto. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a current basis (and in any event within five business days of the
occurrence of any changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the
status of any such Parent Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or
request (including the material terms and conditions thereof and of any
modification thereto), including furnishing copies of any written revised
proposals. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall promptly (and in any
event within five business days) notify the Company orally and in writing if
it determines to begin negotiations concerning a Parent Superior Proposal
pursuant to Section 4.4(c). Parent shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is party to any agreement, which prohibits Parent from
providing such information to the Company.

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 4.4(a)_, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent Parent or the Parent Board from, prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of Parent Common Stock, engaging in any discussions
or negotiations with, or providing any non-public information to, any Person,
if and only to the extent that (i) Parent receives from such Person a bona
fide written Parent Superior Proposal, or a Parent Acquisition Proposal, which
was not solicited by Parent in violation of _Section 4.4(b)_, and which the
Parent Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and outside financial advisors) could reasonably be expected to
result in a Parent Superior Proposal and (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to act on the Parent Superior Proposal or
Parent Acquisition Proposal, as the case may be, could be inconsistent with
its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of Parent under applicable Laws,
(ii) prior to providing or disclosing any non-public information to
any Person in connection with such proposal, the Parent Board receives from
the Person making such Parent  



 

-57-  Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms
no less restrictive on such Person than the terms contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that such confidentiality agreement
shall not be required to contain standstill provisions and shall not contain
any provisions that would prevent the Company from complying with its
obligation to provide the required disclosure to Parent pursuant to this
Section 4.3, and (iii) Parent concurrently discloses any such non-public
information to the Company if such non-public information has not been
disclosed previously to the Company.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Parent Stockholder Approval, in response to an Intervening Event
that was not known by the Parent Board as of the date of this Agreement, the
Parent Board may, if it concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal advisors) that failure to do so could be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of Parent under applicable Laws,
withdraw, modify or change its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger
(a " _Parent Change of Recommendation_ "), but only at a time that is after
the fifth business day following the Companys receipt of written notice from
Parent advising the Company of its intention to do so; _provided_ that, if
such action is in response to or relates to a Parent Acquisition Proposal,
then the Parent Change of Recommendation shall be taken only in compliance
with _Section 4.4(e)_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in response
to a Parent Acquisition Proposal which was not solicited by Parent in
violation of _Section 4.4(a)_, if the Parent Board concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that a
Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal and (after
consultation with its legal advisors) that failure to do so could be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of Parent
under applicable Laws, the Parent Board may at any time prior to the Parent
Stockholder Approval, (i) effect a Parent Change of Recommendation or (ii)
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Parent Superior Proposal, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Board
may not effect such Parent Change of Recommendation or termination unless and
until (i) five business days have elapsed following delivery to the Company of
a written notice of such determination by the Parent Board and of the
material terms and conditions of the Parent Acquisition Proposal and the
identity of the Person making the Parent Acquisition Proposal, and, during
such five business day period, Parent reasonably cooperates with the Company
with respect thereto with the intent of enabling the Company to agree to a
modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be effected and so that such Parent
Acquisition Proposal would no longer represent a Parent Superior Proposal,
including negotiating in good faith with the Company and its representatives
with respect to any proposed revisions to the terms of this Agreement,
and (ii) at the end of such five business day period, the Parent Board shall
have determined in good faith, after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by the Company, if any,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that (A) in the case of a
Parent Change of Recommendation, failure to take such action could be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of Parent
under applicable Laws and (B) in the case of a termination of this Agreement,
that such Parent Acquisition Proposal remains a Parent Superior Proposal as
compared to the Merger, as supplemented by any counterproposals made by the
Company; _provided_ _that_ , in the event the Parent Board does not make the
determination referred to  



 

-58-  in this clause (ii) of this paragraph but thereafter determines to effect a
Parent Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 4.4(e), the foregoing procedures shall apply anew and shall
also apply to any subsequent withdrawal, amendment or modification, and (iii)
contemporaneously with such termination, Parent enters into a definitive
acquisition, merger or similar agreement to effect the parent Superior
Proposal.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
Parents stockholders if the Parent Board (after consultation with its legal
advisors), concludes that its failure to do so could be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of Parent under applicable Law; it
being understood that any such disclosure that does not reaffirm the Parent
Boards recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger (and recommend that
Parents shareholders reject the applicable tender offer or exchange offer
within the ten day period specified by Rule 14d-9) or which is otherwise
adverse to the Company shall be deemed a Parent Change of Recommendation for
purposes of this Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless and until this Agreement shall have
been terminated in accordance with its terms, Parent shall comply with its
obligations under _Section 5.2_ whether or not the Parent Board makes a
Parent Change of Recommendation or recommends any other offer or proposal. Any
action pursuant to and in accordance with _Sections 4.4(d),(e) or (f)_ shall
not constitute a breach of Parents representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement.

harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each present and
former director and officer of the Company (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of or pertaining to: (i) the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee or agent of the
Company or any Subsidiary, a fiduciary under any Company Employee Plan or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or
other enterprise, or (ii) this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby (and the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall,
jointly and severally, pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that
such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if such
person is determined to not be entitled to indemnification). The rights of
each Indemnified Person under this _Section 5.11_ shall be in addition to
any rights such Indemnified Person may have under the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company, or under any Delaware Law or any other
applicable Laws or under any agreement of such Indemnified Person with the

will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ ,

any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld); and _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the

-64-  terms of coverage and amounts, and containing substantially similar terms
and conditions as existing policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with at least the
same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less

_provided further_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 250% of current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance to maintain or procure
insurance coverage pursuant hereto, in which case, the Surviving Corporation
shall provide the maximum coverage that is then available for 250% of such

5.12_ or this Agreement shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any
particular Company Employee Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.12_ or (iii) alter the nature of
the employment of any Employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or shall
otherwise obligate Parent or the Surviving Corporation to (A) employ or
otherwise retain any Employee for a certain length of time or (B) maintain any
particular Company Employee Plan. Nothing in this _Section 5.12_ or this
Agreement creates, or is intended to create, any employment agreement or
contract, whether express or implied.

(b) Without limiting Section 5.12(a), each Employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an employee
of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") and continue to

terms and conditions which are substantially the same as for any similarly
situated employee of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) To the extent of any changes in medical, dental or health plans covering
Continuing Employees after the Effective Time, and to the extent
permissible under such plans, Surviving Corporation shall cause such plan to
(i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions
were covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of the
Company  



 

-65-  and (ii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability
requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or
after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company plan prior to the
Effective Time.

employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, or (ii) require the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Surviving

parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director
or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall
be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and
nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan
or other employee benefit plan for any purpose.

(f) The Company shall, to the extent such action is in compliance with all
Laws, discontinue any further contributions to the Company employee stock
ownership plan (" _ESOP_ "), and, prior to the Effective Time, take such other
action with respect to the ESOP as may be reasonably requested by Parent in
order to minimize or eliminate the continuing obligations of the Company with
respect to the ESOP.

extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable Company
Employee Plan, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall cause
the Company Employee Plans to be amended to the extent necessary to comply
with Section 409A of the Code.

and the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall

Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise use
commercially reasonable efforts to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. For avoidance of doubt, no Company Change of Recommendation or Parent
Change of Recommendation shall negate or change the approval of the Company
Board or the Parent Board, as the case may be, for the purposes of causing
any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

SECTION 5.14 _Exemption From Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall each take all such steps as may
be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of Shares or conversion

under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.



 

-66- SECTION 5.15 _Appointment of Directors_. Effective as of the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the number of directors constituting its Board of
Directors to be increased to thirteen (13) members, and shall take all actions
necessary to cause six (6) of such members to be Company Directors, each to

qualified in the manner provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of Parent, or as otherwise provided by applicable law.

by Parent, the Companys right to receive the Parent Termination Fee and the
payment of the Company Expenses pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall be the
exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
stockholders, partners, members, affiliates, directors, officers or agents for
the loss suffered as a result of breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger
Sub or the failure of the Merger to be consummated upon termination of this
Agreement.

(d) The parties each agree that the agreements contained in this Section 7.4
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and

Agreement; accordingly, if the Parent fails promptly to pay any amounts due
under this Section 7.4 and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Parent for such amounts,
Parent shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment of
such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was due, together with the

2 ARTICLE II

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 2.1 _Further Assurances_

From time to time, at the reasonable request of FCStone, each Stockholder
shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered such
additional documents and instruments and take all such further action as may
be reasonably necessary or desirable under applicable law to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 2.2 _Specific Performance_

Each Stockholder agrees that FCStone would be irreparably damaged if for any
reason the Stockholder fails to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement, and that FCStone would not have an adequate remedy at law for money
damages in such event. Accordingly, FCStone shall be entitled to seek
specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief to enforce the
performance of this Agreement by the Stockholder. This provision is without
prejudice to any other rights that FCStone may have against the Stockholder
for any failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 2.3  _Notices_

All notices to be given pursuant hereto shall be given in accordance with
Section 8.2 of the Merger Agreement, with the address for the Stockholder as
set forth on the signature page hereof.

Section 2.4 _Definitions and Interpretation_  

Capitalized terms that are used but not defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. Section 8.4 of the Merger Agreement
shall govern the interpretation hereof.

Section 2.5 _Counterparts_

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement.

Section 2.6 _Binding Effect and Assignment_

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto, their respective permitted successors and assigns. This Agreement
shall not be assignable by either party hereto without the written consent of
the other party hereto. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any rights, benefits or
obligations hereunder. No person other than the parties hereto is an intended
beneficiary of this Agreement or any portion hereof.



 

3 Section 2.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the provisions of this
Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts
of law. Each of the parties hereto agrees that this Agreement involves at
least U.S. $100,000 and that this Agreement has been entered into in express
reliance upon 6 _Del. C._ § 2708\. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally confirms and agrees that it is and shall continue to be (i)
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the
federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware, and (ii) subject to service
of process in the State of Delaware. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (a) consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court located in the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware
Courts_ "), including the Delaware Court of Chancery in and for New Castle
County, for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and agrees
not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), (b)
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the
Delaware Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that
such litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum and
(c) acknowledges and agrees that any controversy that may arise under this
Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and
therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
directly or indirectly arising or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 2.8 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the parties, and there are no other agreements between the parties
in connection with the subject matter hereof except as set forth specifically
herein or contemplated hereby. No supplement, modification or waiver of this
Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound
thereby. The failure of a party to exercise any right or remedy shall not be
deemed or constitute a waiver of such right or remedy in the future. No
waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether
similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided.

Section 2.9 _Severability_

Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid but
if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein. The parties shall endeavor in good faith
negotiations to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision with
a valid provision the effects of which come as close as possible to those of
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.



 

4 Section 2.10 _Attorneys  Fees_

If any action at law or in equity is necessary to enforce or interpret the
terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
reasonable attorneys fees, costs and necessary disbursements, in addition to
any other relief to which such party may be entitled.

Section 2.11 _Stockholder Capacity_

Each Stockholder signs solely in the Stockholders capacity as the record
holder or beneficial owner of the Subject Shares and nothing in this Agreement
shall limit or affect any actions taken by the Stockholder in the
Stockholders capacity as an officer or director of the Parent.

Section 2.12 _Several Obligations_

The obligations of each Stockholder under this Agreement are several and not
joint, and no Stockholder shall have any liability for any violation of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement by any other Stockholders.

Section 2.13 _Termination_

This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the
first to occur of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with its terms, (ii) the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement),
or (iii) a Parent Change of Recommendation.

Annex A- 1 Exhibit B

THE TRANSFER OF THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED HEREIN AND TO RESALE RESTRICTIONS UNDER

THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

THIS STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT , dated as of July 1, 2009 (this " _Agreement_
"), is made by and between FCSTONE GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation ("
_Issuer_ "), and INTERNATIONAL ASSETS HOLDING CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (" _Grantee_ "). 

WHEREAS , Issuer, Grantee and International Assets Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), are concurrently herewith entering
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Issuer will be merged with Merger
Sub, with Issuer being the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ "); and

WHEREAS , as a condition and inducement to Grantees execution of the Merger
Agreement, Grantee has required that Issuer agree, and Issuer has agreed, to
grant Grantee the Option (as defined herein).

NOW, THEREFORE , in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and in
the Merger Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Issuer and
Grantee agree as follows:

1\. _Defined Terms_.

(a) Capitalized terms which are used but not defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

(b) The term "person" shall have the meaning specified in Sections 3(a)(9)
and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.

2\. _Grant of Option_. Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an irrevocable option
(the " _Option_ ") to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, up to 5,558,107 shares (as adjusted as set forth herein, the " _Option
Shares_ ") of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Issuer (the "
_Issuer Common Stock_ ") at a purchase price per Option Share (as adjusted as
set forth herein, the " _Purchase Price_ ") of $4.15; provided that in no
event shall the number of Option Shares for which this Option is exercisable
exceed 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock
without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the
Option. Issuer shall make proper provision so that each Option Share issued
upon exercise of the Option shall be accompanied by the applicable number of
rights or other benefits as may be provided in any Issuer rights agreement or
similar agreement that may be adopted after the date hereof. 3\. _Exercise of Option_.

(a) Grantee may exercise the Option, in whole or in part, at any time and from
time to time following the occurrence of a Purchase Event (as defined
in Section 3(b)) on or after the date hereof; provided that the Option shall
terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the earliest to occur of
(A) the Effective Time, (B) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof so long as, in the case of this clause (B), such
termination did not result in a Purchase Event pursuant to Section
3(b)(ii)(A), (B), (C) or (E) of this Agreement and such termination did not
occur after a Person shall have made a Company Acquisition Proposal described
in Section 3(b)(ii)(D)(I), (C) twelve months after the termination of the
Merger Agreement if a Person shall have made a Company Acquisition Proposal
described in Section 3(b)(ii)(D)(I) and no Company Acquisition shall have
been consummated and no definitive agreement with respect to any Company
Acquisition shall have been entered into, and (D) the date which is six months
after the occurrence of a Purchase Event; and provided, further, that any
purchase of shares upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to compliance
with applicable law; and provided, further, that Grantee shall have sent the
written notice of such exercise (as provided in Section 3(d)) within six
months following such Purchase Event. Notwithstanding the termination of the
Option, Grantee shall be entitled to purchase those Option Shares with respect
to which it has exercised the Option in accordance herewith prior to the
termination of the Option. The termination of the Option shall not affect any
rights hereunder which by their terms extend beyond the date of such
termination.

(b) As used herein, a " _Purchase Event_ " means any of the following events:

(i) prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement, any person (other than
Grantee or any Subsidiary of Grantee) shall have acquired
beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) of or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any
group (as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other
than a group of which Grantee or any Subsidiary of Grantee is a member, shall
have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of, shares of Issuer Common Stock or other voting
securities representing 20% or more of the voting power of Issuer; or

(ii) (A) the Issuer terminates the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(k)
thereof, (B) the Grantee terminates the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(h) thereof, (C) any Person shall have made a Company Acquisition Proposal
during the term of the Merger Agreement which proposal has been publicly
disclosed and not withdrawn prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and
thereafter the Merger Agreement is terminated by any party pursuant to Section
7.1(f) thereof, (D) (I) any Person shall have made a Company Acquisition
Proposal during the term of the Merger Agreement which proposal has been
publicly disclosed and not withdrawn prior to the termination of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger Agreement is terminated by any party pursuant such
Section 7.1(b) and (II) within twelve months after the termination of the
Merger Agreement, any Company Acquisition shall have been consummated or a
definitive agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition shall have been
entered into, or (E) the Parent terminates the Merger Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1 (e), due to the Issuers willful breach of or willful failure to
perform its obligations under any covenant contained in the Merger Agreement.

  

 

-2- (c) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any
Purchase Event described in Section 3(b)(i) or Section 3(b)(ii)(C) or (D) of
this Agreement, it being understood that the giving of such notice by Issuer
shall not be a condition to the right of Grantee to exercise the Option.

(d) In the event Grantee wishes to exercise the Option, Grantee shall give
Issuer written notice (the date of which is herein referred to as the "
_Notice Date_ ") specifying (i) the total number of Option Shares it intends
to purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier
than three business days nor later than 60 business days from the Notice Date
for the closing (the " _Closing_ ") of such purchase (the date of such
Closing, the " _Closing Date_ "); provided that if the Closing cannot be
consummated by reason of any applicable law, rule, regulation or order or the
need to obtain any necessary approvals or consents of applicable Governmental
Entities, the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this
sentence shall run instead from the date on which such restriction on
consummation has expired or been terminated; and provided, further, without
limiting the foregoing, that if prior notification or application to, approval
of or authorization by any Governmental Entity is required in connection with
such purchase, Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
Grantee in the prompt filing of the required notice or application for
approval or authorization, and the Closing shall occur immediately following
the date on which such approvals have been obtained and any required
notification or waiting periods have expired.

(e) In the event Grantee receives official notice that an approval or
consent of any Governmental Entity required for the purchase of Option Shares
will not be issued or granted, Grantee shall be entitled to exercise the
Option in connection with the resale of Issuer Common Stock or other
securities pursuant to a registration statement as provided in Section 10 to
the extent permitted by applicable law. The provisions of this Section 3 and
Section 4 shall apply with appropriate adjustments to any such exercise.

4\. _Payment and Delivery of Certificates_.

(a) On each Closing Date, Grantee shall (i) pay to Issuer, in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer
(provided that the failure or refusal of Issuer to designate a bank account
shall not preclude Grantee from exercising the Option), an amount equal to
the Purchase Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares to be purchased
on such Closing Date, and (ii) present and surrender this Agreement to Issuer
at the address of Issuer specified in Section 13(f).

(b) At each Closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available
funds and surrender of this Agreement as provided in Section 4(a), (i) Issuer
shall deliver to Grantee (A) a certificate or certificates representing the
Option Shares to be purchased at such Closing, which Option Shares shall be
fully paid, validly issued and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens,
claims, charges, security interests or other encumbrances (" _Liens_ ") other
than those created by the express terms of this Agreement, and subject to no
preemptive or other similar rights, and (B) if the Option is exercised in
part only, an executed new agreement with the same terms as this Agreement
evidencing the right to purchase the balance of the shares of Issuer Common
Stock purchasable hereunder, and (ii) Grantee shall deliver to Issuer a
letter agreeing that Grantee shall not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of
such Option Shares in violation of applicable federal and state securities
laws or of the provisions of this Agreement. 



 

-3- (c) In addition to any other legend that is required by applicable law,
certificates for the Option Shares delivered at each Closing shall be
endorsed with a restrictive legend which shall read substantially as follows:

THE TRANSFER OF THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE IS SUBJECT TO
RESALE RESTRICTIONS ARISING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED.

(d) It is understood and agreed that the above legend shall be removed by
delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such legend if such Option
Shares have been registered pursuant to the Securities Act, such Option Shares
have been sold in reliance on and in accordance with Rule 144 under the
Securities Act or Grantee shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter
from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Issuer and its counsel, to the effect that such
legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act.

(e) Upon the giving by Grantee to Issuer of the written notice of exercise of
the Option provided for under Section 3(d), the tender of the applicable
Purchase Price in immediately available funds and the tender of this Agreement
to Issuer, Grantee shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares
of Issuer Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, regardless of whether the
stock transfer books of Issuer are then closed or certificates representing
such shares of Issuer Common Stock are then actually delivered to Grantee.
Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all federal, foreign, state, and
local taxes and other charges, that may be payable in connection with the
preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates under this Section
4(d) in the name of Grantee or its assignee, transferee, or designee.

(f) Issuer agrees (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from Liens and
preemptive or similar rights, sufficient authorized but unissued or treasury
shares of Issuer Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without
additional authorization of Issuer Common Stock after giving effect to all
other options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase
Issuer Common Stock then outstanding, (ii) that it will not, by charter
amendment or through reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, liquidation, spin-off, sale of assets or similar transaction, or
by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or
performance of any of the covenants, agreements, stipulations or conditions to
be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer, and (iii) that it will promptly
take all action as may from time to time be required (including (A) complying
with all premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements and
(B) in the event prior approval or authorization of or notice or application
to any Governmental Entity is necessary before the Option may be exercised,
cooperating fully with Grantee in preparing such applications or notices and
providing such information to such Governmental Entities as may be required)
in order to permit Grantee to exercise the Option and Issuer to duly and
effectively issue shares of Issuer Common Stock pursuant hereto on a timely
basis.



 

-4- 5\. _Representations and Warranties of Issuer_. Issuer hereby represents and
warrants to Grantee as follows:

(a) _Corporate Authority_. Issuer has full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; the execution and delivery of this Agreement and, subject
to receiving any necessary approvals or consents from Governmental Entities,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized by the Board of Directors of Issuer, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Issuer are necessary to authorize this Agreement or
to consummate the transactions so contemplated; this Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Issuer and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Grantee) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Issuer, enforceable against Issuer in accordance with
its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar
laws, now or hereinafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally, and
(ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

(b) _Shares Reserved for Issuance; Capital Stock_. Issuer has taken all
necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and permit it to
issue, and at all times from the date hereof through the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, will have reserved for issuance, upon
the exercise of the Option, that number of shares of Issuer Common Stock equal
to the maximum number of shares of Issuer Common Stock and other shares and
securities which are at any time and from time to time purchasable upon
exercise of the Option, and all such shares and other securities, upon
issuance pursuant to the Option, will be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all
Liens (other than those created by the express terms of this Agreement) and
not subject to any preemptive or other similar rights.

(c) _No Violations_. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
does not and will not, and the consummation by Issuer of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, its certificate of incorporation
or by-laws, or the comparable governing instruments of any of its
Subsidiaries, or (B) a breach or violation of, or a default under, any
agreement, lease, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other
obligation of it or any of its Subsidiaries (with or without the giving of
notice, the lapse of time or both) or under any law, rule, regulation or
order or governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is subject, that would in any case give any other person
the ability to prevent or enjoin Issuers performance under this Agreement in
any material respect.

(d) _Board Action_. The Board of Directors of Issuer has approved this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as
required under Section 203 of the DGCL and, to its knowledge, any other
applicable state takeover laws so that any such state takeover laws do not and
will not apply to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the purchase of shares of Issuer Common Stock pursuant to
the Option).



 

-5- (e) _No Restrictions_. No Delaware law applicable generally to corporations
or, to Issuers knowledge, other takeover statute applicable generally to
corporations or similar corporate law and no provision of the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of Issuer or any agreement to which Issuer is a party
(i) would or would purport to impose restrictions which might adversely
affect or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (ii) as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (A) would or would purport to restrict or
impair the ability of Grantee to vote or otherwise exercise the rights of a
shareholder with respect to securities of Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
that may be acquired or controlled by Grantee or (B) would or would purport
to entitle any person to acquire securities of Issuer.

6\. _Representations and Warranties of Grantee_. Grantee hereby represents
and warrants to Issuer as follows:

(a) _Corporate Authority_. Grantee has full corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; the execution and delivery of this Agreement and, subject to
obtaining any necessary approvals or consents from Governmental Entities, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Grantee; and this
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Grantee and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Issuer) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Grantee, enforceable against Grantee in accordance with
its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar
laws, now or hereinafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally, and
(ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion
of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

(b) _Purchase Not for Distribution_. Any Option Shares or other securities
acquired by Grantee upon exercise of the Option will not be acquired with a
view to the public distribution thereof in violation of any federal or state
securities laws and will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of
except in a transaction registered or exempt from registration under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.

7.  _Adjustment upon Changes in Issuer Capitalization, Etc_.

(a) In the event of any change from time to time in Issuer Common Stock
or any other shares or securities subject to the Option by reason of a stock
dividend, subdivision, spinoff, stock split, split-up, merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, or dividend or
distribution, other than regular cash dividends, on or in respect of the
Issuer Common Stock, the type and number of shares or securities subject to
the Option, and the Purchase Price therefor, shall be adjusted appropriately,
and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such
transaction, so that Grantee shall receive, upon exercise of the Option, the
number and class of shares or other securities or property that Grantee would
have received in respect of Issuer Common Stock if the Option had been
exercised immediately prior to such event, or the record date therefor, as
applicable. If any additional shares of Issuer Common Stock are issued or
otherwise become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other than
pursuant to  



 

-6-  an event described in the first sentence of this Section 7(a) or upon
exercise of the Option or upon the exercise of any stock option issued to
an officer, director or employee of Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to the Issuers equity incentive plan that is outstanding as of the
date hereof), the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock subject to the
Option shall be increased so that, after such issuance, it, together with any
shares of Issuer Common Stock previously issued pursuant hereto, equals 19.9%
of the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock then issued and outstanding,
without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the
Option. No provision of this Section 7 shall be deemed to affect or change, or
constitute authorization for any violation of, any of the covenants,
agreements, representations or warranties in the Merger Agreement. 

(b) Without limiting the parties relative rights, remedies, liabilities and
obligations under the Merger Agreement or this Agreement, in the event that,
prior to the termination of the Option, Issuer shall enter into an agreement
(other than the Merger Agreement)

(i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than Grantee or one of
its Subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of
such consolidation or merger,

(ii) to permit any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, to
merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or
surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then
outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged
for another class or series of stock or other securities of Issuer or any
other person or cash or any other property, or the outstanding shares of
Issuer Common Stock immediately prior to such merger shall, after such merger,
represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents having
general voting power of the merged company, or 

(iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets (or
those of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, to any person, other than Grantee or one of its
Subsidiaries,

then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall
make proper provisions so that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any
such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be
converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the " _Substitute Option_ "), at
the election of Grantee, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as
hereinafter defined), or (y) any person that controls the Acquiring
Corporation (such person being referred to as the " _Substitute Option
Issuer_ ").

(c) The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the Option; provided
that the exercise price therefor and number of shares subject thereto shall
be as set forth in this Section 7 and the repurchase rights relating thereto
shall be as set forth in Section 9; provided, further, that if a Purchase
Event shall have occurred prior to or in connection with the issuance of such
Substitute Option, the Substitute Option shall be exercisable immediately upon
issuance without the occurrence of a further Purchase Event; and provided,
further, that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal
reasons, be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as  



 

-7-  similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to Grantee. Substitute
Option Issuer shall also enter into an agreement with Grantee in
substantially the same form as this Agreement, which shall be applicable to
the Substitute Option.

(d) The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of
Substitute Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) as is equal to the
Market/Offer Price (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the number of shares
of Issuer Common Stock for which the Option was theretofore
exercisable, divided by the Average Price (as hereinafter defined). The
exercise price of the Substitute Option per share of Substitute Common Stock
(the " _Substitute Option Price_ ") shall then be equal to the Purchase Price
multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the number of shares of
Issuer Common Stock for which the Option was theretofore exercisable and the
denominator is the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the
Substitute Option is exercisable. 

(e) The following terms have the meanings indicated:

(i) " _Acquiring Corporation_ " shall mean (x) the continuing or surviving
corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if other than Issuer),
or at Grantees election, any person that controls such surviving
corporation, (y) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the continuing or
surviving person, or (z) the transferee of all or substantially all of
Issuers assets (or of the assets of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole).

(ii) " _Market/Offer Price_ " shall mean the highest of (v) the highest price
per share of Issuer Common Stock at which a tender offer or an exchange offer
therefor has been made, (w) the highest price per share of Issuer Common Stock
to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (x) the
price per share of Issuer Common Stock received by holders of Issuer Common
Stock in connection with any merger or other business combination transaction
described in Section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii), (y) the highest closing
price for shares of Issuer Common Stock within the 12-month period
immediately preceding the date on which the merger, consolidation, asset sale
or other transaction in question is consummated, and (z) in the event of a
sale of all or substantially all of Issuers assets (or those of its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole) an amount equal to (I) the sum of the price
paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the
remaining assets of Issuer, as determined by a nationally-recognized
independent investment banking firm selected by Grantee, divided by (II) the
number of shares of Issuer Common Stock outstanding at such time. In
calculating the Market/Offer Price, in the event that a tender offer or an
exchange offer is made for Issuer Common Stock or an agreement is entered
into involving consideration other than cash, the value of the securities or
other property issuable or deliverable in exchange for Issuer Common Stock
shall be determined by a nationally-recognized independent investment banking
firm selected by Grantee.

(iii) " _Average Price_ " shall mean the average closing sales price per share
of a share of Substitute Common Stock quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market (or
if Substitute Common Stock is not quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market, the
highest bid price per share as quoted on the principal trading market on which
such shares are traded as reported by a recognized source) for the 12-month
period immediately preceding the date of consummation of the consolidation,
merger or sale in question; provided that if Issuer is the issuer of the
Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be computed with respect to a
share of common stock issued by Issuer, by the person merging into Issuer or
by any company which controls such person, as Grantee may elect.

  

 

-8- (iv) " _Substitute Common Stock_ " shall mean the shares of capital stock (or
similar equity interest) with the greatest voting power in respect of the
election of directors (or persons similarly responsible for the direction of
the business and affairs) of the Substitute Option Issuer.

(f) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the
Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of
Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute
Option. In the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more
than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock but for the limitation in
the first sentence of this Section 7(f), Substitute Option Issuer shall make
a cash payment to Grantee equal to the excess of (i) the value of the
Substitute Option without giving effect to the limitation in the first
sentence of this Section 7(f) over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option
after giving effect to the limitation in the first sentence of this Section
7(f). This difference in value shall be determined by a nationally-recognized
independent investment banking firm selected by Grantee.

(g) Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in Section 7(b)
unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that controls the Acquiring
Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of Issuer hereunder and take
all other actions that may be necessary so that the provisions of this Section
7 are given full force and effect (including, without limitation, any action
that may be necessary so that the holders of the other shares of common stock
issued by Substitute Option Issuer are not entitled to exercise any rights by
reason of the issuance or exercise of the Substitute Option and the shares of
Substitute Common Stock are otherwise in no way distinguishable from or have
lesser economic value (other than any diminution in value resulting from the
fact that the shares of Substitute Common Stock are restricted securities, as
defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any successor provision) than
other shares of common stock issued by Substitute Option Issuer).

8\. _Repurchase at the Option of Grantee_.

(a) At the request of Grantee at any time commencing upon the first occurrence
of a Repurchase Event (as defined in Section 8(c)) and prior to the
termination of the Option pursuant to Section 3(a), Issuer (or any successor)
shall repurchase from Grantee (x) the Option and (y) all shares of Issuer
Common Stock purchased by Grantee pursuant hereto with respect to which
Grantee then has beneficial ownership. The date on which Grantee exercises its
rights under this Section 8 is referred to as the " _Request Date_ ". Such
repurchase shall be at an aggregate price (the " _Section 8 Repurchase
Consideration_ ") equal to the sum of:

(i) the Purchase Price paid by Grantee for each share of Issuer Common Stock
acquired pursuant to the Option with respect to which Grantee then has
beneficial ownership, multiplied by the number of such shares;



 

-9- (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Market/Offer Price for each share of
Issuer Common Stock over (y) the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to
Section 7), multiplied by the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock with
respect to which the Option has not been exercised; and

(iii) the excess, if any, of the Market/Offer Price over the Purchase Price
paid (or, in the case of Option Shares with respect to which the Option
has been exercised but the Closing Date has not occurred, payable, as
adjusted pursuant to Section 7) by Grantee for each share of Issuer Common
Stock with respect to which the Option has been exercised and with respect to
which Grantee then has beneficial ownership, multiplied by the number of such
shares.

(b) If Grantee exercises its rights under this Section 8, Issuer shall,
within 5 business days after the Request Date, pay the Section 8 Repurchase
Consideration to Grantee in immediately available funds, and contemporaneously
with such payment, Grantee shall surrender to Issuer the Option and
the certificates evidencing the shares of Issuer Common Stock purchased
thereunder with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership, and
Grantee shall warrant that it has sole record and beneficial ownership of such
shares and that the same are then free and clear of all Liens.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that prior notification to or
approval of any Governmental Entity is required in connection with the payment
of all or any portion of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration, Grantee
shall have the ongoing option to revoke its request for repurchase pursuant to
Section 8, in whole or in part, or to require that Issuer deliver from time to
time that portion of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration that it is not
then so prohibited from paying and promptly file the required notice or
application for approval and expeditiously process the same (and each party
shall cooperate with the other in the filing of any such notice
or application and the obtaining of any such approval) and the period of time
that would otherwise run pursuant to the preceding sentence for the payment of
the portion of the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration shall run instead from
the date on which, as the case may be, (i) any required notification period
has expired or been terminated or (ii) such approval has been obtained and, in
either event, any requisite waiting period shall have passed. If any
Governmental Entity disapproves of any part of Issuers proposed repurchase
pursuant to this Section 8, Issuer shall promptly give notice of such fact to
Grantee. If any Governmental Entity prohibits the repurchase (and Issuer
hereby undertakes to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all required
approvals from Governmental Entities to accomplish such repurchase) in part
but not in whole, then Grantee shall have the right (i) to revoke the
repurchase request or (ii) to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, determine whether the repurchase should apply to the Option and/or
Option Shares and to what extent to each, and Grantee shall thereupon have the
right to exercise the Option as to the number of Option Shares for which the
Option was exercisable at the Request Date less the sum of the number of
shares covered by the Option in respect of which payment has been made
pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii) and the number of shares covered by the portion
of the Option (if any) that has been repurchased; whereupon, in the case of
clause (ii), Issuer shall promptly (x) deliver to Grantee that portion of the
Section 8 Repurchase Consideration that Issuer is not prohibited from
delivering and (y) deliver to Grantee, as appropriate, either (A) a new Stock
Option Agreement evidencing the right of Grantee to purchase that number of
shares of Issuer Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of
Issuer Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was
exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction,
the  



 

-10-  numerator of which is the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration less the
portion thereof theretofore delivered to Grantee and the denominator of which
is the Section 8 Repurchase Consideration, or (B) a certificate for the
Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing; provided that if the
Option shall have terminated prior to the date of such notice or shall be
scheduled to terminate at any time before the expiration of a period ending
on the thirtieth business day after such date, Grantee shall nonetheless have
the right so to exercise the Option or exercise its rights under this Section
8 until the expiration of such period of 30 business days. Grantee shall
notify Issuer of its determination under the preceding sentence within 10
business days of receipt of notice of disapproval of the repurchase.

(c) As used herein, a " _Repurchase Event_ " shall occur if (A) (i) any person
(other than Grantee or any Subsidiary of Grantee) shall have acquired
beneficial ownership of (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or
any group shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to
acquire beneficial ownership of, 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of
Issuer Common Stock or (ii) any of the transactions described in Section
7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii) has been consummated and (B) a Purchase Event
shall have occurred prior to the termination of the Option.

9\. _Repurchase of Substitute Option_.

(a) At the request of Grantee at any time prior to the termination of the
Substitute Option as set forth in Section 3(a), Substitute Option Issuer (or
any successor) shall repurchase from Grantee (x) the Substitute Option and (y)
all shares of Substitute Common Stock purchased by Grantee pursuant hereto
with respect to which Grantee then has beneficial ownership. The date on
which Grantee exercises its rights under this Section 9 is referred to as the
"Section 9 Request Date". Such repurchase shall be at an aggregate price (the
" _Section 9 Repurchase Consideration_") equal to the sum of:

(i) the purchase price paid by Grantee for each share of Substitute Common
Stock acquired pursuant to the Option or Substitute Option with respect to
which Grantee then has beneficial ownership, multiplied by the number of such
shares;

(ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Substitute Applicable Price (as
hereinafter defined) for each share of Substitute Common Stock over (y) the
Substitute Option Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 7) multiplied by the
number of shares of Substitute Common Stock with respect to which the
Substitute Option has not been exercised; and

(iii) the excess, if any, of the Substitute Applicable Price over the
purchase price paid (or in the case of shares with respect to which the Option
or Substitute Option has been exercised but the Closing Date has not occurred,
payable) by Grantee for each share of Substitute Common Stock with respect to
which the Option or Substitute Option has been exercised and with respect to
which Grantee then has beneficial ownership, multiplied by the number of such
shares.

(b) If Grantee exercises its rights under this Section 9, Substitute Option
Issuer shall, within 5 business days after the Section 9 Request Date, pay the
Section 9 Repurchase Consideration to Grantee in immediately available funds,
and  



 

-11-  contemporaneously with such payment, Grantee shall surrender to Substitute
Option Issuer the Substitute Option and the certificates evidencing the shares
of Substitute Common Stock purchased thereunder with respect to which Grantee
then has beneficial ownership, and Grantee shall warrant that it has sole
record and beneficial ownership of such shares and that the same are then free
and clear of all Liens. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that
prior notification to or approval of any Governmental Entity is required in
connection with the payment of all or any portion of the Section 9 Repurchase
Consideration, Grantee shall have the ongoing option to revoke its request
for repurchase pursuant to Section 9, in whole or in part, or to require that
Substitute Option Issuer deliver from time to time that portion of the Section
9 Repurchase Consideration that it is not then so prohibited from paying and
promptly file the required notice or application for approval and
expeditiously process the same (and each party shall cooperate with the other
in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such
approval) and the period of time that would otherwise run pursuant to the
preceding sentence for the payment of the portion of the Section 9 Repurchase
Consideration shall run instead from the date on which, as the case may
be, (i) any required notification period has expired or been terminated or
(ii) such approval has been obtained and, in either event, any requisite
waiting period shall have passed. If any Governmental Entity disapproves of
any part of Substitute Option Issuers proposed repurchase pursuant to this
Section 9, Substitute Option Issuer shall promptly give notice of such fact to
Grantee. If any Governmental Entity prohibits the repurchase (and Substitute
Option Issuer hereby undertakes to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
all required approvals from Governmental Entities to accomplish such
repurchase) in part but not in whole, then Grantee shall have the right (i) to
revoke the repurchase request or (ii) to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, determine whether the repurchase should apply to the
Substitute Option and/or Option Shares and to what extent to each, and Grantee
shall thereupon have the right to exercise the Substitute Option as to the
number of Option Shares for which the Substitute Option was exercisable at the
Section 9 Request Date less the sum of the number of shares covered by the
Substitute Option in respect of which payment has been made pursuant to
Section 9(a)(ii) and the number of shares covered by the portion of the
Substitute Option (if any) that has been repurchased; whereupon, in the case
of clause (ii), Substitute Option Issuer shall promptly (x) deliver to
Grantee that portion of the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration that
Substitute Option Issuer is not prohibited from delivering and (y) deliver to
Grantee, as appropriate, either (A) a new Stock Option Agreement evidencing
the right of Grantee to purchase that number of shares of Substitute Common
Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock
for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the time
of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the Section 9 Repurchase Consideration less the portion thereof theretofore
delivered to Grantee and the denominator of which is the Section 9 Repurchase
Consideration or (B) a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so
prohibited from repurchasing; provided that if the Substitute Option shall
have terminated prior to the date of such notice or shall be scheduled to
terminate at any time before the expiration of a period ending on the 30th
business day after such date, Grantee shall nonetheless have the right so to
exercise the Substitute Option or exercise its rights under Section 9 until
the expiration of such period of 30 business days. Grantee shall notify
Substitute Option Issuer of its determination under the preceding sentence
within 10 business days of receipt of notice of disapproval of the repurchase.



 

-12- (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Substitute Applicable Price_ "
means the highest closing sales price per share of Substitute Common Stock
during the six months preceding the Section 9 Request Date.

(d) Following the conversion of the Option into a Substitute Option, all
references to " _Issuer_ ", " _Issuer Common Stock_ " and " _Section 8_"
contained herein shall also be deemed to be references to " _Substitute
Option Issuer_ ", " _Substitute Common Stock_ " and " _Section 9_",
respectively.

10\. _Registration Rights_.

(a) _Demand Registration Rights_. Issuer shall, subject to the conditions
of Section 10(c) below, if requested by any Grantee following a Purchase
Event that occurs prior to the termination of the Option, including Grantee
and any permitted transferee (" _Selling Stockholder_ "), as expeditiously
as possible prepare, file and keep current a registration statement under the
Securities Act if such registration is necessary in order to permit the sale
or other disposition of any or all shares of Issuer Common Stock or other
securities that have been acquired by or are issuable to the Selling
Stockholder upon exercise of the Option in accordance with the intended method
of sale or other disposition stated by the Selling Stockholder in such
request, including, without limitation, a "shelf" registration statement
under Rule 415 under the Securities Act or any successor provision, and Issuer
shall use its best efforts to qualify such shares or other securities for sale
under any applicable state securities laws. 

(b) _Additional Registration Rights_. If Issuer at any time after the exercise
of the Option proposes to register any shares of Issuer Common Stock under
the Securities Act in connection with an underwritten public offering of such
Issuer Common Stock, Issuer will promptly give written notice to Grantee of
its intention to do so and, upon the written request of any
Selling Stockholder given within 30 days after receipt of any such notice
(which request shall specify the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock
intended to be included in such underwritten public offering by the Selling
Stockholder), Issuer will cause all such shares for which a Selling
Stockholder requests participation in such registration to be so registered
and included in such underwritten public offering; provided, however, that
Issuer may elect to not cause any such shares to be so registered (i) if in
the reasonable good faith opinion of the underwriters for such offering, the
inclusion of all such shares by the Selling Stockholder would materially
interfere with the marketing of such offering (in which case Issuer
shall register as many shares as possible without materially interfering with
the marketing of the offering), or (ii) in the case of a registration solely
to implement an employee benefit plan or a registration filed on Form S-4 of
the Securities Act or any successor Form. If some but not all the shares of
Issuer Common Stock with respect to which Issuer shall have received requests
for registration pursuant to this Section 10(b) shall be excluded from such
registration, Issuer shall make appropriate allocation of shares to be
registered among the Selling Stockholders desiring to register their shares
pro rata in the proportion that the number of shares requested to be
registered by each such Selling Stockholder bears to the total number of
shares requested to be registered by all such Selling Stockholders then
desiring to have Issuer Common Stock registered for sale.

(c) _Conditions to Required Registration_. Issuer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause each registration statement referred to in Section 10(a)
above to become effective and to obtain all consents or waivers of
other parties which are required  



 

-13-  therefor and to keep such registration statement effective as may be
reasonably necessary to effect such sale or other disposition; provided,
however, that Issuer may delay any registration of Option Shares required
pursuant to Section 10(a) above for a period not exceeding 90 days provided
Issuer shall in good faith determine that any such registration would
adversely affect an offering of other securities by Issuer then in
registration, and Issuer shall not be required to register Option Shares under
the Securities Act pursuant to Section 10(a) above:

(i) prior to the earlier of (a) termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant
to Article VII thereof and (b) a Purchase Event;

 

(ii) on more than three occasions;

(iii) within 90 days after the effective date of a registration referred to in
Section 10(b) above pursuant to which the Selling Stockholder or Selling
Stockholders concerned were afforded the opportunity to register all
such shares under the Securities Act and shares were registered to the extent
requested;

(iv) unless a request therefor is made to register at least 25% or more of
the aggregate number of Option Shares (including shares of Issuer Common Stock
and other securities issuable upon exercise of the Option) then outstanding;
and

(v) after the first date upon which the aggregate number of Option Shares
(including shares of Issuer Common Stock and other securities issuable
upon exercise of the Option) then outstanding is less than 1% of the
aggregate issued and outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock.

In addition to the foregoing, Issuer shall not be required to maintain the
effectiveness of any registration statement (other than a shelf registration
statement referred to in Section 10(a)) after the expiration of three months
from the effective date of such registration statement. Issuer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make any filings, and take all steps, under all
applicable state securities laws to the extent necessary to permit the sale or
other disposition of the Option Shares so registered in accordance with the
intended method of distribution for such shares; provided, however, that
Issuer shall not be required to consent to general jurisdiction or qualify to
do business in any state where it is not otherwise required to so consent to
such jurisdiction or to so qualify to do business. If requested by any such
Grantee in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to
any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to
the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties,
indemnities and other agreements customarily included in secondary offering
underwriting agreements. Upon receiving any request under this Section 10 from
any Grantee, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known
to Issuer to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 10, in each
case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record
of the persons entitled to receive such copies.

(d) Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 10, in lieu of complying
with its obligations pursuant to a request made by any Grantee under this
Section 10, Issuer may, at its election, repurchase the Option Shares
requested to be registered by such Grantee at a purchase price per share equal
to the average closing price of such Option Shares during the 10 business
days preceding  



 

-14-  the date on which Issuer gives notice to Grantee of its intention to
repurchase such Option Shares (which notice shall be given no later than 15
days after Grantee has given notice to Issuer of its election to exercise its
registration rights under Section 10(a) or 10(b)).

(e)  _Expenses_. Except where applicable state law prohibits such payments
and except for underwriting discounts or commissions and brokers fees, Issuer
will pay all expenses (including, without limitation, registration fees,
qualification fees, blue sky fees and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel), legal fees and expenses, including the reasonable fees
and expenses of one counsel to the holders whose Option Shares are being
registered, printing expenses and the costs of special audits or "cold
comfort" letters, expenses of underwriters, excluding discounts and
commissions but including liability insurance if Issuer so desires or the
underwriters so require, and the reasonable fees and expenses of any
necessary special experts) in connection with each registration pursuant to
Section 10(a) or 10(b) above (including the related offerings and sales by
holders of Option Shares) and all other qualifications, notifications or
exemptions pursuant to Section 10(a) or 10(b) above.

(f) _Indemnification_.

(i) In connection with any registration under Section 10(a) or 10(b) above,
Issuer hereby indemnifies the Selling Stockholders, and each
underwriter thereof, including each person, if any, who controls such Selling
Stockholders or underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act, and including each director, officer, stockholder, partner, member,
employee, representative and agent of any thereof, against all expenses,
losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged
untrue, statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement
or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments
or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any
omission, or alleged omission, to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
except insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities of
such indemnified party are caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement that was included by Issuer in any such registration statement or
prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with, information
furnished in writing to Issuer by such indemnified party expressly for use
therein, and Issuer and each person, if any, who controls Issuer within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and each director, officer,
stockholder, partner, member, employee, representative and agent of Issuer
shall be indemnified by such Selling Stockholders, or by such underwriter, as
the case may be, for all such expenses, losses, claims, damages and
liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue, statement, that was
included by Issuer in any such registration statement or prospectus or
notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements
thereto) in reliance upon, and in conformity with, information furnished in
writing to Issuer by such Selling Stockholders or such underwriter, as the
case may be, expressly for such use.

(ii) Promptly upon receipt by a party indemnified under this Section 10(e) of
notice of the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in
respect of which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought against any
indemnifying party under this Section 10(e), such indemnified party shall
notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action,
 



 

-15-  but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of
any liability which it may otherwise have to any indemnified party under
this Section 10(e) unless the failure so to notify the indemnified party
results in substantial prejudice thereto. In case notice of commencement of
any such action shall be given to the indemnifying party as above provided,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent
it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to
assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by
it and satisfactory to such indemnified party. The indemnified party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate
in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel (other than
reasonable costs of investigation) shall be paid by the indemnified party
unless (i) the indemnifying party agrees to pay the same, (ii) the
indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel
satisfactory to the indemnified party, or (iii) the indemnified party
has been advised by counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available
to the indemnifying party that may be contrary to the interest of the
indemnified party, in which case the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
assume the defense of such action notwithstanding its obligation to bear fees
and expenses of such counsel. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any
settlement entered into without its consent, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld.

(iii) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10(e) is unavailable
to a party otherwise entitled to be indemnified in respect of any expenses,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then the
indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such party otherwise entitled to
be indemnified, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such party
to be indemnified as a result of such expenses, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by Issuer, the Selling Stockholders and the underwriters
from the offering of the securities and also the relative fault of Issuer,
the Selling Stockholders and the underwriters in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such expenses, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result
of the expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above
shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably
incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any
action or claim; provided, however, that in no case shall any Selling
Stockholder be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the
net offering proceeds attributable to its Option Shares included in the
offering. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Any
obligation by any Selling Stockholder to indemnify shall be several and not
joint with other Selling Stockholders.

(iv) In connection with any registration pursuant to Section 10(a) or 10(b)
above, Issuer and each Selling Stockholder (other than Grantee) shall enter
into an agreement containing the indemnification provisions of this Section
10(e).

(g) _Miscellaneous Reporting_. Issuer shall comply with all reporting
requirements and will do all such other things as may be necessary to permit
the expeditious sale at any time of any Option Shares by the Selling
Stockholders thereof in accordance with and to the extent permitted by any
rule or regulation promulgated by the SEC from time to time, including,
without limitation,  



 

-16-  Rule 144\. Issuer shall at its expense provide the Selling Stockholders with
any information necessary in connection with the completion and filing of any
reports or forms required to be filed by them under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, or required pursuant to any state securities laws or the rules
of the FINRA or any stock exchange.

(h) _Issue Taxes_. Issuer will pay all stamp taxes in connection with the
issuance and the sale of the Option Shares and in connection with
the exercise of the Option, and will save the Selling Stockholders harmless,
without limitation as to time, against any and all liabilities with respect to
all such taxes.

11\. _Quotation or Listing_. If Issuer Common Stock or any other securities to
be acquired in connection with the exercise of the Option are then authorized
for quotation or trading or listing on any securities exchange or securities
quotation system, Issuer, upon the request of Grantee, will promptly file an
application, if required, to authorize for quotation or trading or listing the
shares of Issuer Common Stock or any other securities to be acquired upon
exercise of the Option on such securities exchange or securities quotation
system and will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain approval, if
required, of such quotation or listing as soon as practicable.

12\. _Division of Option_. This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are
exchangeable, without expense, at the option of Grantee, upon presentation
and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer for other
Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling the
holder thereof to purchase in the aggregate the same number of shares of
Issuer Common Stock purchasable hereunder. The terms " _Agreement_ " and "
_Option_ " as used herein include any other Stock Option Agreement and related
Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) may be
exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it
of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the
case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification
to protect Issuer from any loss which it may suffer if this Agreement is
replaced, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Agreement, if mutilated,
Issuer will execute and deliver a new agreement of like tenor and date.

13\. _Miscellaneous_.

(a)  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Merger
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and
expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of
its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel.

(b)  _Waiver and Amendment_. Any provision of this Agreement may be waived at
any time by the party that is entitled to the benefits of such provision. This
Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented except upon
the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the parties
hereto. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or  



 

-17-  privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to
any subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder.

(c) _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; Severability_. This
Agreement, together with the Merger Agreement and the other documents and
instruments referred to herein and therein, between Grantee and Issuer
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto (or their respective successors and
assigns) (other than any transferees of the Option Shares or any permitted
transferee of this Agreement pursuant to Section 13(h)) any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
Governmental Entity to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected impaired or
invalidated. If for any reason such court or Governmental Entity determines
that the Option does not permit Grantee to acquire, or does not require Issuer
to repurchase, the full number of shares of Issuer Common Stock as provided
in Section 2 (as may be adjusted herein), it is the express intention of
Issuer to allow Grantee to acquire or to require Issuer to repurchase such
lesser number of shares as may be permissible without any amendment or
modification hereof. 

(d) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to
choice of law principles thereof).

(e) _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The descriptive headings contained herein are for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation". The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and
words of similar import shall be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole,
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Any pronoun shall
include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. 

(f) _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, telecopied (with
confirmation) or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) to the parties at the addresses set forth in the Merger Agreement
(or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice). 

(g) _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed
in two counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when both counterparts have been signed,
it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  

 

-18- (h) _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder or under the Option shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Grantee
may assign this Agreement to a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Grantee (in which
event the term " _Grantee_ " as used herein shall be deemed to refer to such
Subsidiary). Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this paragraph (h) shall prohibit Issuer from engaging in
a transaction contemplated by Section 7(b) in accordance with the provisions
of Section 7(b), provided that the terms of this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement shall remain applicable with respect to any such transaction.

(i) _Further Assurances_. In the event of any exercise of the Option by
Grantee, Issuer and Grantee shall execute and deliver all other documents and
instruments and take all other action that may be reasonably necessary in
order to consummate the transactions provided for by such exercise.

(j) _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each party hereto irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the State of Delaware
for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each party hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in the federal and state courts located in
the State of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each party hereto further irrevocably consents to the
service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such suit,
action or other proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by mail to
such party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of
process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered
mail; provided that nothing in this Section shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. The
consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section shall not constitute a
general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware shall have no
effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section. Each party hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law.

(k) _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court as provided in the
Section above, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

(l) _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTERS
(WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF,
RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.
