iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (" _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
as of February 3, 2015 (the " _Agreement Date_ "), by and among Under Armour,
Inc., a Maryland corporation (" _Parent_ "); Marathon Merger Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
"); MyFitnessPal, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "); and
Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as the
Securityholders Agent (as defined in _Section 10.1_). Certain capitalized
terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_.

RECITALS

 

A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with this
Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "). Upon
consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company
will become a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 

B. The respective boards of directors of Merger Sub, Parent and the Company
have approved this Agreement.

 

C. As an inducement for Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the
Major Stockholders is entering into an Indemnification Agreement in favor of
Parent (an " _Indemnification Agreement_ ").

 

D. As an inducement for Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain
individuals who hold shares or options to purchase shares of the Company are
entering into Noncompetition and Non-Solicitation Agreements in favor of
Parent (collectively the " _Noncompetition Agreements_ "), which shall become
effective at the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.3_).

E. As an inducement for Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company
will deliver to Parent and Merger Sub written consents of the Major
Stockholders, in a form agreed to by Parent and the Company (the "
_Stockholder Written Consent_ "), which shall together be sufficient to
approve and adopt this Agreement and approve each of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, in accordance with the Charter
Documents, the DGCL and the CGCL.

AGREEMENT

 

The parties to this Agreement agree as follows:



   1. | DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION 
---|--- 

1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease.
The Company will continue as the surviving  corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 

1.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of King
and Spalding LLP, 1180 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30309 at 10:00 a.m.
(Atlanta Time) on a date to be designated by Parent, which shall be no later
than the later to occur of (i) the fifth Business Day after the satisfaction
or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 6_ and _7_ (other than those conditions set forth in _Sections
6.6(e)_ , _6.6(f)_ and _7.4_ , which are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or (ii) May 31, 2015
(provided, however, upon completion of the Credit Facility Amendment, this
_clause (ii)_ shall be of no further force and effect), or at such other
time and/or date as Parent and the Company may jointly designate. The date on
which the Closing actually takes place is referred to in this Agreement as the
" _Closing Date_." Contemporaneously with or as promptly as practicable after
the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") conforming to the requirements of the DGCL to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall
become effective as of the time that the Certificate of Merger is filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date or time
as may be agreed by the Company and Merger Sub in writing and specified in
the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of
the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, all references in this Agreement to "immediately prior to
the Closing" shall be deemed to refer to a point in time immediately before
the Closing and _after_ the conversion of the Preferred Stock into Common
Stock.

 

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time: 

(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time in a form acceptable to Parent;

(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be those individuals designated by Parent in its sole
discretion.

1.5 Conversion of Shares.

(a) _Conversion_. Subject to _Sections 1.5(g)_ , _1.7_ and _1.8_ , at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any stockholder of the Company or any
other Person:

 



2 (i) each share of Capital Stock held in the Companys treasury or owned

subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, if any, shall be extinguished and canceled without payment of
any consideration with respect thereto;

(ii) each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (all such issued and outstanding shares, other than any
share of Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(i)_, the "
_Outstanding Capital Stock_ ") shall be converted automatically into the right
to receive (following the surrender of the certificate representing such
share of Common Stock or the delivery of an appropriate affidavit, in each
case, in accordance with _Section 1.8_):

 

(A) an amount in cash per share of Common Stock equal to: (1) Per Share
Amount; _minus_ (2) the Per Share Escrow Amount; _minus_ (3) the Per Share
Expense Amount;

(B) any cash disbursements required to be made out of the Escrow Amount with
respect to such share to the former holder thereof in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement, as and when such disbursements are required to be made;

 

(C) any cash disbursements required to be made out of the Expense Amount with
respect to such share to the former holder thereof in accordance with this
Agreement, as and when such disbursements are required to be made.

(iii) each share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted automatically into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding
share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of
common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which the
shares of common stock of Merger Sub were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 

The amount of cash, if any, that each Effective Time Holder is entitled to
receive at any particular time for the shares of Outstanding Capital Stock
held by such Effective Time Holder or the shares of Capital Stock subject to
Outstanding Vested Options (as defined in _Section 1.6(a)_) shall be rounded
to the nearest cent (with $0.005 being rounded upward) and computed after
aggregating the cash amounts payable at such time for all shares of each
class and series of Outstanding Capital Stock represented by a particular
stock certificate and all Outstanding Vested Options held by such Effective
Time Holder represented by a particular option grant.

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

duplication: (A) the aggregate number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock
(including: (1) any such shares that are subject to a repurchase option or
risk of forfeiture under any restricted stock purchase agreement or other
Contract; (2) any such shares subject to issuance pursuant to Options that
are exercised prior to the Effective Time; and (3) any such shares subject to
issuance pursuant to the conversion prior to the Effective Time of any
Preferred Stock); _plus_ (B) the aggregate number of shares of Capital Stock
purchasable under or otherwise subject to Outstanding Vested Options and
Outstanding Unvested Options (it being understood that any other rights to
purchase or acquire Capital Stock that terminate as of the Effective Time, if
not exercised prior to the Closing, shall not be included in the Fully Diluted
Company Share Number); _plus_ (C) the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock that would be issuable upon the conversion of any convertible
securities of the Company (other than shares of Preferred Stock) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(vii) " _Per Share Amount_ " means the amount obtained by _dividing_ : (A) the
_sum_ of (1) the Adjusted Transaction Value _plus_ (2) the Aggregate Exercise
Amount; _by_ (B) the Fully Diluted Company Share Number.

 

(viii) " _Per Share Escrow Amount_ " means, with respect to each share of
Outstanding Capital Stock held by a Non-Dissenting Stockholder and each share
of Capital Stock subject to an Outstanding Vested Option, the amount obtained
by _dividing_ (A) the Escrow Amount by (B) the _sum_ of (1) the aggregate
number of shares of Capital Stock held by all Non-Dissenting Stockholders
_plus_ (2) the aggregate number of shares of Capital Stock purchasable under
or otherwise subject to Outstanding Vested Options.

 

(ix) " _Per Share Expense Amount_ " means, with respect to each share of
Outstanding Capital Stock held by a Non-Dissenting Stockholder and each share
of Capital Stock subject to an Outstanding Vested Option, the amount obtained
by _dividing_ (A) the Expense Amount by (B) the _sum_ of (1) the aggregate
number of shares of Capital 

 



4  Stock held by all Non-Dissenting Stockholders _plus_ (2) the aggregate
number of shares of Capital Stock purchasable under or otherwise subject to
Outstanding Vested Options.

 

(c) _Escrow_. An amount equal to the Escrow Amount shall be deposited by
Parent in escrow at the Effective Time, and held and disbursed by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

 

(d) _Expense Fund_. An amount equal to the Expense Amount shall be deposited
by Parent with the Securityholders Agent at the Effective Time, and held and

(f) _Payment of Company Transaction Expenses_. At the Effective Time, Parent
shall, on behalf of the Company, pay to such account or accounts as the

the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, declares or pays any
dividend on Capital Stock payable in Capital Stock or in any right to acquire
Capital Stock, or effects a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Capital
Stock into a greater number of shares of Capital Stock, or in the event
the outstanding shares of Capital Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by
reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Capital
Stock, or a record date with respect to any of the foregoing shall occur
during such period, then the amounts payable in respect of shares of
Outstanding Capital Stock pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_ and the amounts
payable in respect of shares of Capital Stock subject to Outstanding Vested
Options pursuant to _Section 1.6_ shall be appropriately adjusted.

1.6 Treatment of Stock Options.

 

(a) _Vested Stock Options_. Subject to _Section 1.8(h)_, each Option that is
vested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time

shall not be assumed or substituted with an equivalent option or right but
shall terminate and shall be cancelled at the Effective Time, and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive for each share of Capital Stock subject

with respect to such share of Capital Stock to the former holder of such
Outstanding Vested Option in accordance with this Agreement, as and when such
disbursements are required to be made.

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be
necessary (under the Stock Plans or otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of
this _Section 1.6(a)_ and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
each holder of an Outstanding Vested Option cancelled as provided in this
_Section 1.6(a)_ shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the consideration specified in this _Section 1.6(a)_,
without interest. 

(b) _Unvested Stock Options_.

 

(i) _Non-employees_. Except as may otherwise be provided in a separate
written agreement (if any) entered into between a non-employee of an Acquired
Company and the Parent or Surviving Corporation between the Agreement Date and
Closing who is a holder of an Outstanding Unvested Option and the Company, as
of the Effective Time, each Outstanding Unvested Option held by a non-
employee of an Acquired Company shall have its vesting accelerated to be fully
vested. For purposes of this _Section 1.6(b)(i)_, "non-employees" excludes
all non-employees of an Acquired Company who are no longer providing services
to the Acquired Company as of the Agreement Date (and therefore all
Outstanding Unvested Options held by any such non-employee of an Acquired
Company who is no longer providing services shall be canceled prior to
the Effective Time to the extent they have not already been canceled).

(ii) _Employees_. Except as may otherwise be provided in a separate written
agreement (if any) between an employee of an Acquired Company who is a holder
of an Outstanding Unvested Option and the Company, (i) as of the Effective
Time, 50% of the shares subject to each such Outstanding Unvested Option
shall have vesting accelerated to be fully vested with shares that would vest
to be agreed upon in writing between Parent and the Company (provided that if
any such holder has an odd number of Outstanding Unvested Options, the
one Option remaining after calculating the amount that is 50% of such
Outstanding Unvested Option shall have vesting accelerated to be fully
vested), and (ii) as of the Effective Time, the remaining 50% of each such
Outstanding Unvested Option shall be converted into and become an option to
purchase Parent Common Stock, with such conversion effected through Parent (A)
assuming such Outstanding Unvested Option or (B) replacing such Outstanding
Unvested Option by issuing a reasonably equivalent replacement stock option
to purchase Parent Common Stock in substitution therefor, in either case in
accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of
the applicable Stock Plan, and the terms of the stock option agreement by
which such Outstanding Unvested Option is evidenced and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements of Code Sections 409A, 424(a) and 422

 



6  such that each such assumed or replaced Option is exempt from Code Section
409A and maintains its status as an "incentive stock option" (if applicable),
to the extent permitted by the Code. All rights under the Outstanding
Unvested Options which are assumed or replaced by Parent shall thereupon be
converted into rights with respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from
and after the Effective Time: (A) each Outstanding Unvested Option assumed or
replaced by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock;
(B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Outstanding
Unvested Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Companys Common Stock that were subject
to such Outstanding Unvested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Conversion Ratio (as defined below), and rounding the resulting number
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (C) the per
share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
each Outstanding Unvested Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be
determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Common Stock subject
to such Outstanding Unvested Option, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise
price up to the nearest whole cent; and (D) subject to the terms of the stock
option agreement by which such Outstanding Unvested Option is evidenced, any
restriction on the exercise of any Outstanding Unvested Option assumed or
replaced by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Outstanding
Unvested Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption
or replacement of such Outstanding Company Option; provided, however, that
Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any
committee thereof with respect to each Outstanding Unvested Option assumed
or replaced by Parent. The " _Conversion Ratio_ " means a fraction having a
numerator equal to Per Share Amount and having a denominator equal to the
average of the closing sale prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as
reported by the New York Stock Exchange for each of the five consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date; provided, however, that
if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Companys Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate. Following
the Effective Time, the Outstanding Unvested Options that are assumed or
replaced by Parent pursuant to this _Section 1.6(b)_ shall vest according to
such options original vesting schedule after taking into account the
acceleration of the Outstanding Unvested Options.

 

(c) _Payment_. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
consideration specified in _Section 1.6(a)_ to be paid to each holder of an
Outstanding Vested Option, through the Surviving Corporations payroll system
in accordance with standard payroll practices (and in any event no later than
the Surviving Corporations second payroll run following the Closing Date),
without interest and subject to any required withholding for applicable Taxes.

1.7 Dissenting Shares.

 



7 (a) _Effect on Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Capital Stock held by a holder who has
properly asserted such holders dissenters rights under the DGCL (or under
Chapter 13 of the CGCL (" _Chapter 13_ ")), and as of the Closing has neither
effectively withdrawn nor lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
holders right to payment of the "fair value" for such shares under the DGCL
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
applicable Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled to only such rights as
are granted by the DGCL (or Chapter 13). Parent shall be entitled to retain
any Merger Consideration not paid on account of such Dissenting Shares pending
resolution of the claims of such holders, and the Effective Time Holders
shall not be entitled to any portion of such retained Merger Consideration.

(b) _Loss of Dissenting Share Status_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
_Section 1.7(a)_, if any holder of shares of Capital Stock who has asserted
such holders right to payment of the "fair value" for such holders
shares under the DGCL (or "fair market value" for such holders shares under
Chapter 13) shall effectively withdraw or lose (through the failure to perfect
or otherwise) such holders dissenters rights, then such holders shares of
Capital Stock shall thereupon be deemed automatically to have been converted,
as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, promptly following the surrender of
the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Capital Stock or
upon the delivery of an appropriate affidavit, in each case, in accordance
with _Section 1.8_.

 

(c) _Notice of Dissenting Shares_. The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt
notice of any demands for payment for shares of Capital Stock received by the
Company, withdrawals of any demands, and any other instruments or notices
served or otherwise delivered pursuant to the DGCL (or Chapter 13) and
received by the Company; and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or other
instruments or notices. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, withheld
or conditioned), make any payment with respect to, settle, offer to settle or
otherwise negotiate any such demands.

1.8 Exchange of Certificates.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as payment
agent in the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ "). On or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the
cash consideration payable pursuant to  _Section 1.5(a)(ii)_. Within five
(5) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Companys payroll provider cash sufficient to pay the cash consideration
payable pursuant to  _Section 1.6(a)_. The cash amount so deposited with the
Payment Agent is referred to herein as the " _Payment Fund_." The Payment
Agent will be instructed to invest the funds included in the Payment Fund in
the manner directed by Parent, but any risk of loss shall remain with Parent.
Any interest or other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall
be the property of, and will be paid to, Parent.

 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
mail to each Person who is a record holder of Capital Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal containing such provisions
as Parent or the Payment Agent may specify

 



8  (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock
Certificates (as defined in _Section 1.8(d)_) shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of such Company Stock Certificates to the Payment Agent, and a provision
whereby such holder agrees to be bound by the provisions of _Sections 1.8_ ,
_9_ , _10.1_ and the other applicable provisions of this Agreement), in each
case as reasonably acceptable to the Company (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ");
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the exchange of Company Stock
Certificates for the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to
such Capital Stock. Upon the surrender to the Payment Agent of a Company Stock
Certificate (or an affidavit of lost stock certificate as described in
_Section 1.8(e)_), together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and
such other documents as Parent or the Payment Agent may reasonably request,
the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, if
any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_
at the time of such surrender, the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled, and the amount equal to the Merger Consideration
shall be paid to such holder promptly. From and after the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Certificate which prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Capital Stock shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares, and
the holder of each such Company Stock Certificate shall cease to have any
rights with respect to the shares of Capital Stock formerly represented
thereby.

 

(c) _Payments to Others_. If payment of Merger Consideration in respect of
shares of Capital Stock converted pursuant to  _Section 1.5_ is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Company Stock
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of
the Company Stock Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) _Stock Transfer Books_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further
registration of transfers of shares of Capital Stock thereafter on the records
of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, certificates for shares of
Outstanding Capital Stock (" _Company Stock Certificates_ ") are presented to
the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares as provided for in
_Section 1.5_. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock
Certificate representing shares of Outstanding Capital Stock shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Capital Stock previously represented by such Company Stock
Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and, if required by the
Payment Agent, to deliver a bond (in such amount, in such form and with such
surety as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against

 



9  any claim that may be made against the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any affiliated party with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate.

 

(f) _Undistributed Payment Funds_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to Effective Time Holders as of the date that is 180
days after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
Effective Time Holders who have not theretofore surrendered their Company
Stock Certificates in accordance with this _Section 1.8_ shall thereafter
look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Capital Stock previously
represented by such Company Stock Certificates, and/or shares of Capital Stock
subject to Vested Outstanding Options, in each case without any interest
thereon.

(g) _Escheat_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither Parent nor any other Person shall be liable to any
Effective Time Holder or to any other Person for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar
applicable Legal Requirement. Any Merger Consideration or other amounts
remaining unclaimed by Effective Time Holders three years after the Effective
Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity)
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the
property of Parent but thereafter remain subject to claim by the
Securityholder otherwise entitled thereto (subject to applicable statute
of limitations).

(h) _Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Securityholder or former
Securityholder of the Company such amounts as Parent determines in good faith
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection therewith
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under
any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

1.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.



   2. | REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 
---|--- 
 

Except as specifically set forth in the Disclosure Schedule prepared by the
Company in accordance with _Section 10.18_ and delivered to Parent
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement setting forth
specific exceptions to the Companys representations and warranties set forth
in this _Section 2_, the Company represents and warrants, to and for the
benefit of the Indemnitees (with the understanding and acknowledgement that
Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement without being
provided with the representations

 



10  and warranties set forth herein, that Parent and Merger Sub are relying on
these representations and warranties, and that these representations and
warranties constitute an essential and determining element of this Agreement,
in each case as such representations and warranties are qualified by the
Disclosure Schedule), as follows:

 

2.1 Organizational Matters.

 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Power to Conduct Business_. Each Acquired
Company (i) has been duly organized, and is validly existing and in good
standing (or equivalent status) (for jurisdictions which recognize such
concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation; (ii) has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted; and (iii)
is duly qualified and in good standing to do business (for jurisdictions which
recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, except where any such failures to be so qualified,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a Material Adverse Effect. _Section 2.1(a)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule accurately sets forth, as of the Agreement Date, each
jurisdiction where each Acquired Company is qualified, licensed or admitted to
do business.

 

(b) _Charter Documents_. The Company has delivered to Parent accurate and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, memorandum of
association, articles of association or equivalent governing documents of each
Acquired Company, in each case as amended to date and currently in effect
(such instruments and documents, the " _Charter Documents_ "). All actions
taken and all transactions entered into by each Acquired Company have been
duly approved by all necessary action of the board of directors (or other
similar body) and stockholders of such Acquired Company. There has been no
violation of any of the provisions of the Charter Documents of any of the
Acquired Companies, and no Acquired Company has taken any action that is
inconsistent in any material respect with any resolution adopted by such
Acquired Companys stockholders or board of directors (or other similar body)
or any committee of the board of directors (or other similar body) of such
Acquired Company.

(c)  _Directors and Officers_. _Section 2.1(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
accurately sets forth as of the Agreement Date: (i) the names of the members
of the board of directors (or similar body) of each Acquired Company; (ii)
the names of the members of each committee of the board of directors (or
similar body) of each Acquired Company; and (iii) the names and titles of the
officers of each Acquired Company.

 

(d) _Subsidiaries_. _Section 2.1(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth,
as of the Agreement Date, a complete and accurate list naming each Entity in
which any Acquired Company owns, holds or has any interest in or right to
acquire capital stock or other equity interests or ownership interests and the
jurisdiction of organization of each such Entity. There are no outstanding
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock
or other equity interests or ownership interests in any Subsidiary, or
options, warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock or other equity
interests or ownership interests in any Acquired Company (other than the
Company). Except for the equity interests identified in _Section 2.1(d)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule, none of the Acquired Companies has ever owned,
beneficially or 

 



11  otherwise, any shares or other securities of, or any direct or indirect
equity interest in, any Entity. None of the Acquired Companies has agreed or
is obligated to make any future investment in or capital contribution to any
Entity.

(e) _Predecessors_. There are no Entities that have been merged into or that
otherwise are predecessors to any Acquired Company.

(f) _Powers of Attorney_. There are no outstanding powers of attorney executed
by or on behalf of any Acquired Company (except, in the case of a Subsidiary
of the Company in favor of the Company).

2.2 Capital Structure.

 

(a) _Capital Stock_.

 

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 7,000,000 shares
of Common Stock and 2,194,288 shares of Preferred Stock, all of which shares
of Preferred Stock are designated as Series A-1 Preferred Stock.

(ii) As of the date hereof: (A) there are 3,390,533 shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding; (B) there are 2,194,288 shares of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding; and (C) the Company has no other issued or
outstanding shares of Capital Stock. All of the issued and outstanding shares
of Capital Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued, and are fully
paid, non-assessable and not subject to any preemptive rights. Except as set
forth in _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no shares of
Capital Stock are subject to any repurchase option, forfeiture provision or
restriction on transfer (other than restrictions on transfer imposed by virtue
of applicable federal and state securities laws). 

(iii) No shares of Capital Stock are held as treasury stock or are owned by
the Company. The Company has never declared or paid any dividends on any
shares of Capital Stock. Since the filing of the Restated Certificate with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on August 2, 2013 to the Agreement
Date, no shares of Capital Stock have been issued (other than pursuant to
exercises of Options issued to employees of any Acquired Company under the
Stock Plans) and no adjustment has been made, pursuant to the provisions of
the Restated Certificate or otherwise, to the conversion price of any share
of Preferred Stock. No consideration is or was required to be paid in respect
of any share of Preferred Stock upon conversion of such shares into shares of
Common Stock in accordance with the Restated Certificate. 

(iv) _Section 2.2(a)(iv)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
Agreement Date, an accurate and complete list of the holders of all the
issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock, the addresses of each such
holder (based on the books and records of the Company) and the class, series
and number of shares of Capital Stock owned of record by each such holder.

(b) _Stock Options_. The Company has reserved 1,066,824 shares of Common Stock
for issuance under the Stock Plans, of which options with respect to 953,281
shares are

 



12  outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. _Section 2.2(b)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule accurately sets forth, with respect to each Option that is
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement: (i) the name of the holder of
such Option and whether such holder is an employee or non-employee; (ii) the
total number of shares of Common Stock that are subject to such Option and the
number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which such Option is
immediately exercisable; (iii) the date on which such Option was granted and
the term of such Option; (iv) the vesting schedule for such Option and whether
the vesting of such Option shall be subject to any acceleration in connection
with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (v) the exercise price per share of Common Stock purchasable under
such Option; and (vi) whether such Option is an "incentive stock option" as
defined in Section 422 of the Code or subject to Section 409A of the Code.
Each grant of an Option was duly authorized no later than the date on which
the grant of such Option was by its terms to be effective (the " _Grant Date_
") by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by
the board of directors of the Company (or a duly constituted and authorized
committee thereof) and any required stockholder approval by the necessary
number of votes or written consents, and the award agreement governing such
grant (if any) was duly executed and delivered by each party thereto, each
such grant was made in compliance with the terms of the applicable
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company and all other applicable
Legal Requirements, the per share exercise price of each Option was equal to
or greater than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the
applicable Grant Date and, except as set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, each such grant was properly accounted for in accordance
with GAAP in the financial statements (including the related notes) of the
Company and each Option qualifies for the Tax treatment afforded to such
Option in the Tax Returns of the Company. All options with respect to shares
of Common Stock that were ever issued by the Company ceased to vest on the
date on which the holder thereof ceased to be an employee of or a consultant
to the Company. The exercise of the Options and the payment of cash in
respect thereof complied and will comply with the terms of the Stock Plans,
all Contracts applicable to such Options and all applicable Legal Requirements
and, as of the Effective Time, no former holder of an Option will have any
rights with respect to such Option other than the rights contemplated by
_Section 1.6(a)_. The Company has delivered to Parent accurate and complete
copies of the Stock Plans, each form of agreement used thereunder and each
Contract pursuant to which any Option is outstanding.

(c) _No Other Securities_. Except for the conversion privileges of the
Preferred Stock and except as set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, there is no: (i) outstanding subscription, option, call, convertible
note, warrant or right (whether or not currently exercisable) with respect to
any shares of Capital Stock or other securities of any Acquired Company; (ii)
outstanding security, instrument or obligation that is or may become
convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital Stock (or cash
based on the value of such shares) or other securities of any Acquired
Company; (iii) Contract under which any Acquired Company is or may become
obligated to sell, grant, deliver or otherwise issue any shares of Capital
Stock or any other securities, including any promise or commitment to grant
Options or other securities of any Acquired Company to an employee of or other
service provider to any Acquired Company; (iv) Contract under which the
Company is or may become obligated to issue or distribute to holders of any
shares of capital stock any evidences of indebtedness or assets of any
Acquired Company; or (v) condition or circumstance that provides a legally-
binding basis for the assertion of a claim by any Person to the effect that
such Person is entitled to acquire or receive

 



13  any shares of Capital Stock or other securities of any Acquired Company. As
of the Effective Time (and after giving effect to the Merger), there will be
no outstanding options, warrants, restricted stock or other rights to
purchase shares of Capital Stock or other securities of any Acquired Company.

(d) _No Agreements_. Except as set forth in _Section 2.2(d)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, there are no Contracts between any Acquired Company and
any Securityholder, or, to the actual Knowledge of the Company (without
inquiry or investigation), among any Securityholders, relating to the
issuance, acquisition (including rights of first refusal or preemptive
rights), disposition, registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") or voting of the capital stock of any
Acquired Company. _Section 2.2(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule accurately
identifies each Company Contract relating to any securities of any Acquired
Company that contains any information rights, registration rights, financial
statement requirements or other terms that would survive the Closing unless
terminated or amended prior to the Closing.

 

(e) _Compliance with Laws_. All shares of Capital Stock, all Options and other
rights to acquire Capital Stock and all other securities that have ever been
issued or granted by any Acquired Company have been issued and granted in
compliance with: (i) all applicable securities laws and all other applicable
Legal Requirements; and (ii) all requirements set forth in all applicable
Contracts. None of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock were issued in
violation of any preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe for or
purchase securities of the Company.

 

(f) _Repurchased Shares_. _Section 2.2(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
accurately sets forth, as of the Agreement Date, with respect to any shares
of capital stock ever repurchased or redeemed by any Acquired Company (other
than unvested shares repurchased by the Company in connection with a holders
termination of service with an Acquired Company): (i) the name of the seller
of such shares; (ii) the number, class and series of shares repurchased or
redeemed; (iii) the date of such repurchase or redemption; and (iv) the price
paid by such Acquired Company for such shares. All shares of capital stock
ever repurchased or redeemed by any Acquired Company were repurchased or
redeemed in compliance with: (A) all applicable securities laws and other
applicable Legal Requirements; and (B) all requirements set forth in
all applicable Contracts.

(g) _Merger Consideration_. No Person will be entitled to receive any Merger
Consideration as a result of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, other than
the Securityholders as shown in the Merger Consideration Certificate.

 

(h) _Subsidiary Shares_. All of the shares of, and other equity interests or
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company are owned by the
Company free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens). The
outstanding shares of each Subsidiary of the Company have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, have been issued in
compliance with all applicable securities laws and other applicable Legal
Requirements and were not issued in violation of or subject to any preemptive
rights or other rights to subscribe for or purchase securities of such
Subsidiaries. There are no options, warrants or other rights outstanding to
subscribe for or purchase any shares or other securities of the

 



14  Subsidiaries of the Company and such Subsidiaries are not subject to any
Contract or court or administrative Order under which any of such Subsidiaries
is or may become obligated to sell or otherwise issue any shares or other
securities. There are no preemptive rights applicable to any shares of any of
the Subsidiaries of the Company. None of the Subsidiaries of the Company has
the right to vote on or approve the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The capital stock or other equity interests or
ownership interests of the Subsidiaries are not subject to any voting trust
agreement or any other Contract relating to the voting, dividend rights
or disposition of the capital stock or other equity interests of the
Subsidiaries.

2.3 Authority and Due Execution.

 

(a) _Authority_. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement and each other agreement, document or instrument

will be a party (the " _Company Transaction Documents_ ") and to consummate

(b) _Due Execution_. This Agreement has been, and, upon execution and

its terms, subject only to the effect, if any, of (i) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally, and (ii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive

use, and sale of the Company Products, or the performance of the Company
Services, on or prior to the Closing.

university, college or other educational institution or research center were

4.4 No Negotiation. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not, and
shall ensure that no Representative of the Company, nor any Acquired Company

encourage the initiation or submission of any expression of interest,

termination of the 401(k) Plans to be effective no later than the day

to sponsor and maintain any such 401(k) Plan, Severance Plan, or other

to terminate such Company Benefit Plans (the form and substance of which

executed amendments to such Company Benefit Plans sufficient to assure
compliance with all applicable requirements of the Code and
regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the Company
Benefit Plan will be maintained at the time of termination. In the event that
the distributions of assets from the trust of a 401(k) Plan which is
terminated are reasonably anticipated to trigger liquidation charges,
surrender charges, or other fees to be imposed upon the account of any
participant or beneficiary of such terminated plan or upon any Acquired
Company or plan sponsor, then the Company shall take such actions as

option of Parent, a later time), which resignations shall be effective as of
the Effective Time and shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Parent.
Each such resignation shall state and acknowledge that the Acquired Companies

Statement_ ") signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company (on behalf
and in the name of the Company), which sets forth the Cash Amount. Attached to
the Closing Date Indebtedness Statement will be copies of the Pay Off Letters
(as defined in _Section 4.12_) delivered in accordance with _Section 4.12_.

officers with coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not less
than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less
favorable to the insured persons than the terms of, the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company.

 

4.14 Tax Returns.

(a) Each Acquired Company shall prepare and file in a timely manner all Tax
Returns required to be filed by it that are due on or before the Closing Date
taking into account applicable extensions. On or before the Closing Date, each
Acquired Company shall pay in a timely manner all Taxes that are due from it
on or before the Closing Date. Each such Tax Return shall be prepared, in a
manner consistent with past practices employed with respect to the Acquired
Companies and shall utilize accounting methods, elections and conventions
that do not have the effect of distorting the allocation of taxable amounts
and deductions between the Tax periods covered by such Tax Returns and
subsequent Tax periods. Parent shall have the right to

proposed adjustment with respect to Taxes of or attributable to any Acquired
Company or its operations (a " _Tax Contest_ ").

insurability requirements under the terms of the employee arrangements of
Parent (such arrangements, the " _Parent Benefit Arrangements_ ") that are
group health plans to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents.

 

(b) _No Third Party Beneficiaries; No Restrictions_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary: (i) nothing in this  _Section 5.5_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation

intended to or shall be treated as an amendment to, or be construed as

obligations notwithstanding) any knowledge on the part of any of the
Indemnitees or any of their Representatives, regardless of whether obtained

Agreement and (ii) Parent hereby acknowledges that other than the
representations and warranties made in _Section 2_ (as qualified by the

hold harmless and indemnify each of the Indemnitees from and against, and
shall compensate and reimburse each of the Indemnitees for, such Effective
Time Holders Pro Rata Share of any Damages which are suffered or incurred by
any of the Indemnitees (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to
any third party claim) and which arise from or as a result of, or are
connected with the following (the " _Indemnifiable Matters_ "):

 

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement (other than any
representation or warranty that by its terms speaks as of a particular date or
dates, which shall instead be tested as of such date or dates) (without giving
effect to any update or modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or
purported to have been made on or after the date of this Agreement);

(ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Company in this Agreement as if such representation or warranty was made

modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on
or after the date of this Agreement);

 

(iii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company in this
Agreement;

 

(iv) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, the exercise by any stockholder of the Company of such
stockholders dissenters rights under the DGCL or CGCL (it being understood
that if a final determination of the fair value or fair market value of any
Dissenting Shares is made by a court of competent jurisdiction, or
a settlement is reached as to such fair value or fair market value, in
connection with any such exercise of dissenters rights, then the only portion
of such fair value or fair market value to be included in calculation of the 

 



66  Damages incurred as a result of such exercise is the amount, if any, by
which such fair value or fair market value exceeds what otherwise would have
been payable by Parent with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with _Section 1.5_); and

(v) the Company Transaction Expenses to the extent not paid on prior to the
Effective Time or otherwise taken into account in the calculation of the
Merger Consideration.

(b) _Damage to Parent_. The parties acknowledge and agree that, if the
Surviving Corporation suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any
Damages as a result of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, then (without limiting
any of the rights of the Surviving Corporation as an Indemnitee) Parent shall
also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving
Corporation, to have incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with
such inaccuracy or breach.

(c) _Multiple Claims_. Notwithstanding the fact that an Indemnitee may have
the right to assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of more
than one provision, representation, warranty or covenant of this Agreement in
respect of any fact, event, condition or circumstance, no Indemnitee shall be
entitled to double recovery (or recovery more than once) for the amount of
any Damages suffered by such Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee has
otherwise been already compensated for such Damages.

 

9.3 Limitations.

 

(a) _Threshold; Deductible_. Subject to _Section 9.3(b)_, the Effective Time
Holders shall not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to

and until (i) each individual claim or series of related claims exceeds
$50,000 (the " _ _De Minimis_ Threshold_") and (ii) any one or more of the
Indemnitees have suffered or incurred Damages exceeding $1,000,000 (the "
_Deductible_ ") in the aggregate. If the total amount of such Damages exceeds
the Deductible, then the Indemnitees shall be entitled to be indemnified
against and compensated and reimbursed for the amount of Damages exceeding the
Deductible.

 

(b) _Applicability of _De Minimis_ Threshold; Deductible_. The limitation set
forth in _Section 9.3(a)_ shall not apply (and shall not limit the
indemnification or other obligations of any Effective Time Holder) (i) as to
any representation or warranty herein made by the Company, in the event of
Fraudulent breach of such representation or warranty by or on behalf of the
Company or (ii) in the case of a breach of a Fundamental Representation.

(c) _Recourse to Escrow Amount_. The indemnification rights of the
Indemnitees contained in this _Section 9_ shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Indemnitees for any and all Damages arising out of or
related to this Agreement and any certificate required to be executed and
delivered in connection herewith or otherwise executed and delivered at the
Closing (but specifically excluding any Release, Noncompetition Agreement or
employment agreement). This means (i) that the survival periods and liability
limits set forth in this _Section 9_ shall control notwithstanding any
statutory or common law provisions or

 



67  principles to the contrary, (ii) all applicable statutes of limitations or
other claims periods with respect to claims for Damages shall be shortened to
the applicable claims periods and survival periods set forth herein, and
(iii) the Indemnitees irrevocably waive any and all rights they may have to
make claims against any Effective Time Holder under statutory and common law
as a result of any Damages and any and all other damages incurred by the
Indemnitees with respect to this Agreement whether or not in excess of the
maximum amounts permitted to be recovered pursuant to this _Section 9_.
Subject to _Section 9.3(d)_, recourse by the Indemnitees to deduction from
the Escrow Amount shall be the Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy under
this Agreement for monetary Damages resulting from the matters referred to in
_Section 9.2(a)_. All claims for indemnification made by the Indemnitees
pursuant to this _Section 9_ shall be brought first against the Escrow Fund
until the Escrow Fund is exhausted before any claim for indemnification may be
brought against an Effective Time Holder directly; provided that in the case
of a breach of a Fundamental Representation, if such claim results in the
exhaustion of the Escrow Fund, that will not reduce the liability of the
Effective Time Holders for breaches of representations and warranties other
than Fundamental Representations (such that the aggregate liability of the
Effective Time Holders would be the same as if the chronological order of such
claims were reversed).

 

(d) _Applicability of Liability Cap_. The limitation set forth in _Section
9.3(c)_ shall not apply (and shall not limit the indemnification or other
obligations of any Effective Time Holder) in the event of Fraudulent breach of
a representation or warranty herein by or on behalf of the Company or to
breaches of Fundamental Representations (the " _Fundamental Matters_ ").
Subject to _Section 10.3_, the total amount of indemnification payments that
each Effective Time Holder can be required to make to the Indemnitees with
respect to such Fundamental Matters and all other Indemnifiable Matters
(inclusive of the amount that was withheld as part of the Escrow Amount and
the Expense Amount from such Effective Time Holders Merger Consideration)
shall be limited to the aggregate Merger Consideration such Effective Time
Holder was entitled to receive pursuant to _Sections 1.5_ and _1.6(a)_.

(e) _Effect of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments made
pursuant to this _Section 9_ shall be treated by all parties as adjustments
to the aggregate consideration paid in the Merger.

 

(f) _Calculation of Indemnifiable Damages_. Any claim for indemnification
shall be calculated (i) net of all insurance proceeds or other
indemnification or contribution payments from any third party, if any,
actually received by Indemnitee less any increase in premiums or other
recovery costs to such Person as a result of such claim for insurance
proceeds; (ii) as to actual losses and out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Indemnitee, without regard to reductions or diminutions in value,
lost opportunities or other speculative damages; and (iii) without regard to
any punitive, special, incidental or consequential damages unless any such
punitive, special, incidental or consequential damages are payable to a third
party. If any Indemnitee actually receives any insurance or other third party
payment in connection with any claim for Damages for which it has already
been indemnified pursuant to this _Section 9_, it shall pay to the Parent
such recovery for further distribution to the Effective Time Holders in
accordance with the terms hereof within thirty (30) days after such payment
is actually received.

 



68 (g) _No Double-Recovery_. If and solely to the extent that an amount of
Damages in connection with an indemnifiable matter was already taken into
account in connection with calculation of the Merger Consideration, the
Adjusted Transaction Value, the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness or the Company
Transaction Fees (pursuant to the definitions thereof), the same amount of
such Damages may not be recovered under this _Section 9_.

(h) _Equal Treatment_. Any claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2_,
and any offer to compromise or settle such claim, must be made on a pro rata
basis to all Effective Time Holders (based on their respective Pro Rata
Shares).

 

(i) _No Inadvertent Fraud_. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall a
matter that arises between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date
(other than as a result of Fraud by the Company under this Agreement) and
thereby results in a failure of a representation or warranty of the Company
contained in this Agreement or in the certification to be made by the Company
pursuant to _Section 6.6(e)_, be deemed to be Fraud with respect to such
representation or warranty solely on the grounds that the Company may not
legally effectively update the Disclosure Schedule.

 

(j) _Personal Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in no event will any Effective Time Holder be liable for any other
Effective Time Holders breach of such other Effective Time Holders
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in any
ancillary agreement hereto to which such other Effective Time Holder is a
party.

 

(k) _Tax Attributes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the Company is not making and shall not be construed to have made, and the
Effective Time Holders shall not have any liability or indemnification
obligation with respect to, any representation or warranty as to the amount or
availability of any net operating losses, Tax credits, Tax basis or other
Tax attribute. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Effective Time Holders shall not have any liability or indemnification
obligation for any Taxes of the Company (i) resulting from any election made
under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the Merger, (ii) with respect
to any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date,
or (iii) resulting from any action taken by the Company after the Closing on
the Closing Date.

 

9.4 No Contribution. Each Effective Time Holder waives, and acknowledges and
agrees that such Effective Time Holder shall not have and shall not exercise
or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right
of indemnity or advancement of expenses or other right or remedy against the
Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company in connection with any
indemnification obligation to which such Effective Time Holder may become
subject under or in connection with this Agreement or any other agreement or
document delivered to Parent in connection with this Agreement in its
capacity as an Effective Time Holder. Effective as of the Closing, the
Securityholders Agent, on behalf of itself and each Effective Time Holder,
expressly waives and releases any and all rights of subrogation against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company.

 



69 9.5 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
the Surviving Corporation, any Acquired Company, Parent or any other Person)
with respect to which any Effective Time Holder may become obligated to hold
harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to
_Section 9_, Parent shall have the right, at its election, to control and
proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Securityholders Agent (and for this purpose,
it is acknowledged and agreed that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP is satisfactory
to the Securityholders Agent), and the Securityholders Agent shall be
entitled, at its expense (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders), to
participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such third
party claim and Parent shall keep the Securityholders Agent reasonably
apprised of material developments in such Legal Proceeding, and promptly
provide to the Securityholders Agent copies of all pleadings, notices and
communications with respect to such claim or Legal Proceeding to the extent
that receipt of such documents does not waive any privilege. If Parent so
proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

(a) subject to the other provisions of _Section 9_ (including the exhaustion
of any available Deductible), all reasonable defense costs relating to the
defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding shall be borne and paid exclusively
by the Effective Time Holders (regardless of whether the underlying claim or
Legal Proceeding is indemnifiable hereunder); provided Parents sole and
exclusive remedy for such defense costs shall be the then available Escrow
Fund and any recoveries of such defense costs therefrom shall count against
the liability caps in _Section 9.3(c)-(d)_;

(b) each Effective Time Holder shall make available to Parent any documents
and materials in such Effective Time Holders possession or control that may
be necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and

 

(c) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim or
Legal Proceeding; _provided, however,_ that if Parent settles, adjusts or
compromises any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the
Securityholders Agent, such settlement, adjustment or compromise shall not be
conclusive evidence of the existence or amount of Damages incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding (it being
understood that if Parent requests that the Securityholders Agent consent to
a settlement, adjustment or compromise, the Securityholders Agent shall
not unreasonably withhold or delay such consent provided, that the
Securityholders Agent may withhold consent to any requested settlement,
adjustment or compromise if the Securityholders Agent believes in good faith
that there is not any underlying basis for indemnification under this
_Section 9_ with respect to such settlement, adjustment or compromise).

If Parent does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or
Legal Proceeding, the Securityholders Agent may proceed with the defense of
such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent;
_provided, however,_ that the Securityholders Agent may not settle, adjust
or compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
unless (i) such judgment, settlement or compromise includes an unconditional
release from all liability with respect to the claim in favor of the
Indemnitees or (ii) the sole relief provided in connection

 



70  with such judgment, settlement or compromise is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the Effective Time Holders (including from the Escrow Fund) or
any other relief that is enforceable only against The Effective Time Holders.
Parent shall give the Securityholders Agent prompt notice of the commencement
of any such Legal Proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or the Company;
_provided, however_ , that any failure on the part of Parent to so notify the
Securityholders Agent shall not limit any of the obligations of the Effective
Time Holders under _Section 9_ (except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding).

 

If Parent proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding as
contemplated under this _Section 9.5_, upon the request of Parent
and subject to the other provisions of this _Section 9_, the
Securityholders Agent hereby agrees to instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to
Parent from the Escrow Amount an amount equal to the reasonable documented
defense costs of Parent relating to the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding as such expenses are incurred by Parent (regardless of the
provisions of _Section 9.6_ but subject to the limitations of _Section
9.5(a)_) on a monthly basis and subject to a reasonable advance review period
for such documentation.

9.6 Indemnification Claim Procedure. If any Indemnitee has or reasonably
believes it has incurred or suffered, or reasonably believes that it is
reasonably likely to incur or suffer, Damages for which it is or will be
entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed under
_Section 9_ or for which it is or will be entitled to a monetary remedy (such
as in the case of a claim based on Fraudulent breach of a representation or
warranty herein by or on behalf of the Company), such Indemnitee may deliver
a notice of claim (a " _Notice of Claim_ ") to the Securityholders Agent.
Each Notice of Claim shall state the basis for such claim and each Indemnitee
shall make available to the Securityholders Agent any documents
and materials in such Indemnitees possession or control supporting the
claims set forth in the Notice of Claim. In the event the Securityholders
Agent does not notify the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days following its
receipt of a Notice of Claim that the Securityholders Agent (on behalf of
the Effective Time Holders) disputes the liability of the Effective Time
Holders to the Indemnitee under this _Section 9_ or the amount thereof, the
claim specified in such Notice of Claim shall be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Effective Time Holders under this _Section 9_, and Parent
may claim from the Escrow Amount or, to the extent the remaining funds in the
Escrow Amount are insufficient to cover the amount of such claim and such
claim is not subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.3(c)_ in
accordance with _Section 9.3(d)_, the Effective Time Holders shall pay the
amount of such liability to the Indemnitee on demand or, in the case of any
notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion of the claim) is
estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion
of such claim) becomes finally determined. In the event the Securityholders
Agent has timely disputed the liability of the Effective Time Holders (a "
_Claim Objection_ ") with respect to such claim as provided above, as promptly
as possible, such Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent shall establish
the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, litigation,
arbitration or otherwise) and if an agreement is reached, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall
be furnished to the Escrow Agent. If such Indemnitee and the Securityholders
Agent do not reach an agreement as to the merits and amount of such claim
within thirty (30) days immediately after the date such Claim Objection is
delivered to Parent, either Parent or the Company (or the Securityholders
Agent after the Effective Time) may demand arbitration of the matter unless
the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation or
arbitration with

 



71  a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such
amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration. Any arbitration
requested pursuant to this  _Section 9.6_ shall be settled by arbitration
conducted by three (3) arbitrators. Parent and the Company (or the
Securityholders Agent after the Effective Time) shall each select one (1)
arbitrator, and the two (2) arbitrators so selected shall select a third
arbitrator. The arbitrator shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the last
day of any hearings on any motion, issue a definitive ruling on such motion.
The arbitrator shall also, within twenty (20) Business Days from the last day
of any hearings regarding the imposition of sanctions or the issuance of any
awards, issue a definitive ruling on the imposition of any such sanctions or
the issuance of any such award in such arbitration. The arbitrator shall also
establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery, while
allowing the parties a reasonable opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment
of the arbitrator, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties
about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator shall rule upon
motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose
sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a court
of competent law or equity, should the arbitrator determine that discovery was
sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or
objected to without substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator,
or a majority of the three (3) arbitrators, as applicable, shall be binding
and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold
payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Such decision shall
be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions,
which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the
arbitrator. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in
Wilmington, Delaware, under the rules then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association.

 

9.7 Exercise of Remedies Other Than by Parent. No Indemnitee (other than
Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to
assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall
have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise
of such other remedy.



   10. | MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
---|--- 
 

10.1 Securityholders Agent.

 

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of the adoption and approval of this Agreement
and/or the cancellation of Outstanding Vested Options in exchange for Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, the Effective Time Holders
irrevocably nominate, constitute and appoint Fortis Advisors LLC as the
exclusive agent and true and lawful attorney in fact of the stockholders
(the " _Securityholders  Agent_"), with full power of substitution, to act
in the name, place and stead of the Effective Time Holders for purposes of
executing any documents and taking any actions that the Securityholders
Agent may, in the Securityholders Agents sole discretion, determine to be
necessary, desirable or appropriate in connection with any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under _Section 9_. Fortis
Advisors LLC hereby accepts its appointment as Securityholders Agent.

 



72 (b) _Authority_. The Effective Time Holders grant to the Securityholders
Agent full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on
behalf of such Effective Time Holders (in the name of any or all of the
Effective Time Holders or otherwise) any and all documents that the
Securityholders Agent may, in its sole discretion, determine to be
necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and containing such
provisions as the Securityholders Agent may, in its sole discretion,
determine to be appropriate, in performing its duties as contemplated by 
_Section 10.1(a)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholders Agent
shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Effective Time Holders,
except as expressly provided herein and in the Escrow Agreement, and for
purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the Securityholders Agent
in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Disclosure Schedule. Each
Effective Time Holder (i) agrees that all actions taken by the
Securityholders Agent under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall be
binding upon such Effective Time Holder and such Effective Time Holders
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such Effective
Time Holder, and (ii) waives any and all defenses which may be available to
contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Securityholders Agent taken in
good faith under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other
agreement executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby:
(i) each Indemnitee shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Securityholders Agent on all matters relating to any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under _Section 9_; and (ii)
each Indemnitee shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further
evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be
executed on behalf of any Effective Time Holder by the Securityholders
Agent, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any
Effective Time Holder by the Securityholders Agent, as fully binding upon
such Effective Time Holder.

 

(c) _Power of Attorney_. The Effective Time Holders recognize and intend that
the power of attorney granted in  _Section 10.1(a)_ and the powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Securityholders Agent
Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable;
(ii) may be delegated by the Securityholders Agent; (iii) shall survive the
death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of each of the
Effective Time Holders and shall be binding on any successor thereto; and (iv)
shall survive the delivery of any assignment by any Effective Time Holder of
the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interests in the Escrow Fund.

(d)  _Replacement_. If the Securityholders Agent shall die, resign, become
disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder, the
Effective Time Holders shall (by consent of those Persons entitled to at least
a majority of the Merger Consideration), within 10 days after such death,
resignation, disability or inability, appoint a successor to the
Securityholders Agent (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and
immediately thereafter notify Parent of the identity of such successor. Any
such successor shall succeed the Securityholders Agent as Securityholders
Agent hereunder. If for any reason there is no Securityholders Agent at any
time, all references herein to the Securityholders Agent shall be deemed to
refer to the Effective Time Holders.

(e) _Expense Fund_. The Securityholders Agent (for itself and its
Representatives and Affiliates) shall be entitled to full reimbursement from
the Effective Time

 



73  Holders for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including
fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants) incurred by the Securityholders Agent in such capacity (or any
of its Representatives or Affiliates in connection therewith), and to full
indemnification against any loss, liability or expenses, claim, damage, fee,
cost, fine, judgment, amount paid in settlement or expenses (including fees,
disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled professionals and in
connection with seeking recovery from insurers) arising out of actions taken
or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Securityholders Agent (except
for those arising out of the Securityholders Agents gross negligence or
willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and
defense of claims (the " _Securityholders  Agent Expenses_"), from
the Effective Time Holders, including from funds paid to the Securityholders
Agent under this Agreement and/or otherwise received by it in its capacity as
Securityholders Agent, or funds to be distributed to the Effective Time
Holders under this Agreement at its direction, pursuant to or in connection
with this Agreement (including under the Escrow Agreement). In furtherance of
the foregoing, each Effective Time Holder hereby authorizes the Payment Agent
to withhold the Expense Amount from the amounts otherwise payable by the
Payment Agent to the Effective Time Holders pursuant to _Sections 1.5_ and
_1.6(a)_ , with the Payment Agent to withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable to each Effective Time Holder and distribute to the
Securityholders Agent an amount equal to the Expense Amount, and the Payment
Agent shall promptly, and in any event within three Business Days following
the Effective Time, pay the Expense Amount to the Securityholders Agent in
immediately available funds. The Expense Amount shall be retained and used by
the Securityholders Agent in connection with the performance of its duties
and obligations under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and any unused
amounts remaining from the Expense Amount shall be paid by the
Securityholders Agent to the Payment Agent for distribution to the Effective
Time Holders, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, at
such time as the Securityholders Agent determines in its sole discretion to
be appropriate. In addition, following exhaustion of the Expense Amount, each
Effective Time Holder hereby authorizes the Securityholders Agent to instruct
the Escrow Agent to deduct from any amounts to be released from the Escrow
Fund and distributed to such Effective Time Holder in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement an amount equal to such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata
Share of any amounts to which the Securityholders Agent is entitled pursuant
to this _Section 10.1(e)_. If not recovered from the Expense Amount or the
Escrow Fund, any Securityholders Agent Expenses shall be recovered directly
from the Effective Time Holders according to their Pro Rata Shares. The
Effective Time Holders shall not receive interest or other earnings on the
Expense Amount and the Effective Time Holders irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Securityholders Agent any ownership right that they may have in any
interest that may accrue on the Expense Amount. The Securityholders Agent
will hold the Expense Amount separate from its corporate funds and will not
voluntarily make it available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.
The Effective Time Holders acknowledge that the Securityholders Agent is not
providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice. The
Securityholders Agent shall have no responsibility or liability for any
loss of principal of the Expense Amount other than as a result of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. For tax purposes, the Expense Amount shall
be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Effective
Time Holders at the Effective Time. The parties agree that the
Securityholders Agent is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar
capacity in connection with the Expense Amount and has no tax reporting or
income distribution obligations hereunder. The Effective Time Holders

 



74  acknowledge that the Securityholders Agent shall not be required to expend
or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or
administration of its duties.

(f) _Access and Information_. The Securityholders Agent shall have
reasonable access to information about the Surviving Corporation and the
reasonable assistance of the Acquired Companies former officers and employees
for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights
hereunder; provided, that, the Securityholders Agent shall treat
confidentially and not use or disclose the terms of this Agreement or any
nonpublic information from or about the Surviving Corporation to anyone
(except to the Effective Time Holders or the Securityholders Agents
employees, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors or authorized
Representatives on a need to know basis, in each case who agree to treat such
information confidentially); provided, however, that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to provide such access or information
if it determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would jeopardize
the protection of attorney-client privilege. The Securityholders Agent shall
enter into a separate customary confidentiality agreement prior to being
provided access to such information if reasonably requested by Parent. The
Securityholders Agent shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the Merger
Consideration Certificate, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be
genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization
to sign on behalf of the applicable Effective Time Holder or other party.

 

(g) _Advisory Group_. Certain Effective Time Holders (the " _Advisory Group_
") have concurrently herewith entered into a letter agreement with the
Securityholders Agent regarding direction to be provided by the Advisory
Group to the Securityholders Agent. Neither the Securityholders Agent
(together with its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors,
agents and employees) nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the
" _Securityholders  Agent Group_") shall incur any liability to the Effective
Time Holders for any liability incurred by the Securityholders Agent while
acting in good faith and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of its duties (it being understood that any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of
such good faith), even if such act or omission constitutes negligence on the
part of the Securityholders Agent. The Effective Time Holders shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Securityholders Agent Group from
and against any and all Securityholders Agent Expenses incurred without
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Securityholders
Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties hereunder. This immunities and rights to
indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholders Agent or any member of the Advisory Group and the Closing
and/or the termination of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

10.2 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents,
and shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
(prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or
evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

10.3 No Waiver Relating to Claims for Fraud. The liability of any Effective
Time Holder under _Section 9_ will be in addition to, and not exclusive of,
any other liability that such Effective Time Holder may have at law or in
equity based on such Effective Time Holders

 



75  Fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
none of the provisions set forth in this Agreement, including the provisions
set forth in _Section 9_, shall be deemed a waiver by any party to this
Agreement of any right or remedy which such party may have at law or in equity
based on any other Effective Time Holders Fraud, nor will any such provisions
limit, or be deemed to limit: (a) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded
in any such claim for Fraud; (b) the time period during which a claim for
Fraud may be brought; or (c) the recourse which any such party may seek
against another Effective Time Holder with respect to a claim for Fraud.

10.4 Fees and Expenses. Subject to _Sections 1.5_ and _9_ , each party
to this Agreement shall bear and pay all fees, costs and expenses that have
been incurred or that are incurred in the future by such party in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees,
costs and expenses incurred by such party in connection with or by virtue of:
(a) the negotiation, preparation and review of this Agreement (including the
Disclosure Schedule) and all agreements, certificates, opinions and other
instruments and documents delivered or to be delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) the preparation and
submission of any filing or notice required to be made or given in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the
obtaining of any Consent required to be obtained in connection with any of
such transactions; and (c) the consummation of the Merger; _provided, however_
, that Parent shall pay the filing fee incurred in connection with the filing
by the parties hereto of the premerger notification and report forms relating
to the Merger under the HSR Act.

 10.5 Attorneys Fees. If any action, suit or other legal proceeding relating
to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is
brought against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to
any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

 

10.6 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received: (a) if delivered by hand, when
delivered; (b) if sent on a Business Day by email before 5:00 p.m.
(recipients time) on the day sent by email and receipt is confirmed, when

shall not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

Agreement to "Sections," "Schedules" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement.

 10.20 Consent to Representation; Conflict of Interest. If the
Securityholders Agent so desires, acting on behalf of the Effective Time

or Merger Sub, Fenwick and West LLP (" _Fenwick_ ") shall be permitted to
represent the Effective Time Holders after the Closing in connection with any
matter, including without limitation, anything related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any other agreements referenced herein or any
disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, after the Closing, Fenwick shall be permitted to represent the
Effective Time Holders, any of their agents and Affiliates, or any one or
more of them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction or dispute
(including any litigation, arbitration or other adversary proceeding) with
Parent, the Company or any of their agents or Affiliates under or relating to
this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and any
related matter, such as claims or disputes arising under other agreements
entered into in connection with this Agreement, including with respect to
any indemnification claims. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company further agree
that, as to all communications among Fenwick and the Securityholders Agent
and the Effective Time Holders and their respective Affiliates (individually
and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ") in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the
exception of client confidence belongs solely to the Seller Group and may be
controlled only by the Seller Group and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, because the interests of Parent and its
Affiliates were directly adverse to the Company, the Effective Time Holders
and the Securityholders Agent at the time such communications were made.
This right to the attorney-client privilege shall exist even if such
communications may exist on the Companys computer system or in documents in
the Companys possession. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and a Person other
than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company may assert the

 



80  attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure to such third-party of
confidential communications by Fenwick to the Company; provided, however, that
the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
the Securityholders Agent.
