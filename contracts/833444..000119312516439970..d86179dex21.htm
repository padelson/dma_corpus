referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Parties wish to effect a business combination through the merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving
corporation in the merger (the " _Merger_ ");

 

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ " or " _Company Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than (i) Company Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_, and (ii) Company Shares to be converted in
accordance with _Section 2.1(d)_ or _Section 2.1(e)_) shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the " _WBCL_ ") and the Wisconsin Limited
Liability Company Law (the " _WLLCL_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of

pursuant to the WBCL;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board of Directors_
") has adopted resolutions approving the execution of this Agreement and the

Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also prescribe
various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree
as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the WBCL and the WLLCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will
cease, with the Company surviving the Merger (the Company, as the surviving
corporation in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "), such that following the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation will be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The
Merger shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in
the WBCL and the WLLCL.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 9:00 a.m., New York City time, at the offices of Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, NY 10019, on the business
day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ to be satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless another
date or place is agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent. The date on
which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_
".

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause
articles of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ")
to be duly executed and delivered to the WDFI for filing as provided under the
WBCL and the WLLCL and make any other filings, recordings or publications
required to be made by the Company or Merger Sub under the WBCL or the WLLCL
in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective on the date
and time of the filing of the Articles of Merger or, if agreed by Parent and
the Company in writing, such later time and date as specified in the Articles
of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4  _Governing Documents_. At the Effective Time, the articles of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated in
the forms attached hereto as _Exhibit A1_ and _Exhibit A2_ , respectively,
which shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

 



2 Section 1.5 _Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. From and
after the Effective Time, the persons listed on Section 1.5 of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
(unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and Parent), and shall hold
office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or
their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal. The
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and
after the Effective Time, shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation, and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement,
resignation or removal.

 

ARTICLE II

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of
any securities of the Company or of Merger Sub, subject to _Section 2.1(f)_
and any applicable withholding Tax, each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (x)
Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_, (y)
Company Shares to be converted in accordance with _Section 2.1(d)_ or
_Section 2.1(e)_, and (z) Company Shares underlying Company Restricted Stock
Awards) shall be cancelled and in consideration of which the holder thereof
shall have the right to receive the following (the " _Merger Consideration_
"): (i) in the case of a Company Share with respect to which an election to
receive Parent Shares (a " _Share Election_ ") has been properly made and not
revoked or lost pursuant to _Section 2.9_ (each, a " _Share Electing Share_
"), one (1) (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable Parent Share (the " _Share Consideration_ ") and (ii) in the
case of a Company Share with respect to which an election to receive cash (a "
_Cash Election_ ") has been properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to
_Section 2.9_ (each, a " _Cash Electing Share_ "), $34.88 in cash, without
interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), in each case subject to _Section
2.1(b)_. Any Company Share with respect to which neither a Share Election nor
a Cash Election has been properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to
_Section 2.9_ shall be deemed to be a Share Electing Share. The Parties
agree that the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration have been
determined assuming that the Parent Share Consolidation shall have occurred
prior to the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, all such Company
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Company
Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_, including the right to receive,
pursuant to _Section 2.7_, the Fractional Share Consideration, together with
the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_.

(b) _Proration_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration to be received by the
holders of Company Shares in the Merger shall be equal to $3,863,939,529 (the
" _Aggregate Cash Consideration_ "). As used herein, the term " _Cash
Election Amount_ " shall mean the product of the aggregate number of Cash
Electing Shares _multiplied by_ the Cash Consideration.

 



3 (i) If the Cash Election Amount exceeds the Aggregate Cash Consideration,
then, instead of being converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, each Cash Electing Share shall be converted into the right to
receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of (x)
the Cash Consideration, _multiplied by_ (y) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Aggregate Cash Consideration and the denominator of which is the
Cash Election Amount (such fraction, the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (B) a number
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares equal to the
product of (w) the Share Consideration, _multiplied by_ (z) a fraction equal
to one (1) _minus_ the Cash Fraction.

 

(ii) If the Aggregate Cash Consideration exceeds the Cash Election Amount
then, instead of being converted into the right to receive the
Share Consideration, each Share Electing Share shall be converted into the
right to receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to (x) the
amount of such excess, _divided by_ (y) the number of Share Electing Shares,
and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent
Shares equal to the product of (w) the Share Consideration, _multiplied by_
(z) a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference between (I) the
Cash Consideration minus (II) the amount calculated in clause (A), and the
denominator of which is the Cash Consideration.

(c) _Cancellation of Company Shares_. At the Effective Time, all Company
Shares owned by the Company, Parent, any Parent Subsidiary that is a direct or
indirect owner of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or Merger
Sub shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) _Treatment of Company Shares Owned by Parent Subsidiaries_. At the
Effective Time, each Company Share owned by any of the wholly owned Parent
Subsidiaries (other than Merger Sub and any Parent Subsidiary that is a direct
or indirect owner of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time)
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the Share
Consideration.

(e) _Treatment of Merger Sub Interests and Company Shares Owned by Company
Subsidiaries_. At the Effective Time, without any further action on the part
of the Parties or any of their respective equityholders, each limited
liability company interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and all rights in respect thereof, shall be
cancelled and, in exchange for the cancellation of such limited liability
company interests of Merger Sub and the funding of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, the Surviving Corporation shall issue an equivalent number of
fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation, which number shall represent an ownership percentage in the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time that shall
equal the aggregate ownership percentage of all shareholders (other than the
wholly owned Company Subsidiaries) of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each Company Share owned by any wholly
owned Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership
percentage of any such Company Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage
of such Company Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The shares described in this  _Section 2.1(e)_ shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time.

 



4 (f) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Exchange Ratio and the Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Company Shares or Parent Shares,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the number of Company Shares or
Parent Shares outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time (in each case, other than the Parent Share Consolidation).

Section 2.2 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund; Investment of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time,
TIFSA or Merger Sub shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent in connection with the
Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). On or prior to the Closing Date, TIFSA or
Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent
(i) evidence of Parent Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in book-
entry form and cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional
Share Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an
amount sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions on Parent Shares
under _Section 2.2(f)_ (such evidence of book-entry Parent Shares, together
with any such cash amounts, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event that the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay any dividends or other
distributions on Parent Shares under _Section 2.2(f)_, TIFSA or Merger Sub
shall promptly deposit with the Exchange Agent additional funds in an amount
which is equal to the deficiency in order to permit the Exchange Agent to make
such payment. TIFSA or Merger Sub shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and
the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration,
including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration, and any amounts
payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on Parent Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_, out of the Exchange Fund in accordance
with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that
is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed
by mutual agreement of TIFSA or Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash
shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on
the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly
available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares entitled to
receive such amounts pursuant to this _Article II_. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to TIFSA or Merger Sub
on the earlier of (A) one (1) year after the Effective Time or (B) the full
payment of the Exchange Fund.

 



5 (b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event more than three (3) business days following
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry
shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose Company Shares were converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form as Parent and the Company reasonably
agree prior to the Effective Time and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration into
which such Company Shares have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.7_, and any dividends or other distributions on
Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this  _Article II_ , any Fractional Share Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section
2.7_, and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of
dividends or other distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with _Section
2.2(f)_ for each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, to be mailed within three (3) business days following the
Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled.
The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and
(B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to
the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate and Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
_Article II_ , including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.7_, and any dividends or other
distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_, without
interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Shares on the records of the Company.

 



6  From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise provided
for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been
disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Exchange
Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.7_, and any dividends or other distributions on
Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_, payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the
procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for
any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such holder of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 2.1_, including any amount payable in respect of
Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.7_, and any
dividends or other distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with 
_Section 2.2(f)_.

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Shares_. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the Parent Shares issuable
hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by
Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in
each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement. Subject
to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share there shall be paid to the holder
thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such Parent Shares.

 



7 Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards, Company Deferred Awards and
Company Cash Awards_.

(a) _Company Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under any Company Equity Plan
(each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into an option (a " _Parent
Share Option_ ") to acquire (i) that number of whole Parent Shares (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange
Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price per Parent Share (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option by (B) the
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that each such Company Stock Option
that is an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code)
shall be adjusted in accordance with the foregoing in a manner consistent with
the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. The Parties intend that the
adjustments in this _Section 2.3(a)_ are in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and will not subject any Company Stock
Option that is converted into a Parent Share Option to Section 409A of the
Code. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.3(a)_, each such

the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company Stock
Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Company Stock Appreciation Rights_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
stock appreciation right that corresponds to a number of shares of Company

unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by
Parent and shall be converted into a share appreciation right (a " _Parent
Share Appreciation Right_ ") (i) in respect of that number of whole Parent
Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Appreciation Right as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price per
Parent Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
of such Company Stock Appreciation Right by (B) the Exchange Ratio. The
Parties intend that the adjustments in this _Section 2.3(b)_ are in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and will not
subject any Company Stock Appreciation Right that is converted into a Parent
Share Appreciation Right to Section 409A of the Code. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 2.3(b)_, each such Company Stock Appreciation Right
assumed and converted into a Parent Share Appreciation Right pursuant to this
_Section 2.3(b)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same
terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company Stock
Appreciation Right as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



8 (c) _Company Restricted Stock Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
award of Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse
restriction granted under a Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Company Restricted
Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a restricted
share award corresponding to Parent Shares with respect to a number of Parent
Shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
2.3(c)_, each Company Restricted Stock Award assumed and converted into a
Parent Restricted Stock Award pursuant to this _Section 2.3(c)_ shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the corresponding Company Restricted Stock Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Company RSU Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each restricted
stock unit award that corresponds to a number of shares of Company Common
Stock granted under a Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Company RSU Award_ ")
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a restricted share unit award
corresponding to Parent Shares (each, a " _Parent RSU Award_ ") with respect
to a number of Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in
this  _Section 2.3(d)_, each Company RSU Award assumed and converted into a

and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to

whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a
Parent RSU Award with respect to a number of Parent Shares (rounded to
the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU Award as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (as determined by the Company in
its reasonable discretion (A) based upon the greater of target and actual
performance for the 2016 fiscal year (measured as of a date that is on or
about the Effective Time), and (B) disregarding 2017 fiscal year performance
for purposes of Company PSU Awards granted in the Companys 2015 fiscal year)
by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
2.3(e)_, each Company PSU Award that is assumed and converted into a Parent
RSU Award pursuant to this _Section 2.3(e)_ shall continue to have, and
shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including service-vesting
conditions, but excluding performance adjustments) as applied to the
corresponding Company PSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



9 (f) _Company Deferred Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each stock
unit (excluding any Company Equity Award) that is deemed invested in shares of
Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
Company Deferred Compensation Plans (the " _Company Deferred Awards_ ") shall
be deemed to be invested in Parent Shares, with the number of Parent Shares
subject to the Company Deferred Awards in a participants account under each
Company Deferred Compensation Plan as of the Effective Time to be equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Deferred Awards as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Following the Effective Time, the
Company Deferred Compensation Plans will otherwise continue to have the same
terms, including payment terms and investment options, that were applicable
immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the Company Common Stock fund
to be replaced with a Parent Shares fund.

(g) _Company Cash Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each cash-
denominated award granted under any Company Equity Plan (the " _Company Cash
Awards_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a cash award of Parent
(a " _Parent Cash Award_ ") corresponding to a number of dollars equal to the
number of dollars subject to such Company Cash Award (as determined by the
Company in its reasonable discretion (A) based upon the greater of target and
actual performance for the 2016 fiscal year (measured as of a date that is on
or about the Effective Time), and (B) disregarding performance for the 2017
fiscal year for purposes of Company Cash Awards granted in the Companys 2015
fiscal year). Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.3(g)_, each
Company Cash Award that is assumed and converted into a Parent Cash Award
pursuant to this _Section 2.3(g)_ shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions (including service-vesting
conditions, but excluding performance adjustments) as applied to the
corresponding Company Cash Award as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(h) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass
resolutions, provide any notices, obtain any consents, make any amendments to
the Company Equity Plans or Company Equity Awards and take such other actions
as are necessary to provide for the treatment of the Company Stock Options,
Company Stock Appreciation Rights, Company Restricted Stock Awards, Company
RSU Awards and Company PSU Awards (collectively, the " _Company Equity Awards_
") as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall pass resolutions, provide any notices, obtain any consents,
make any amendments to the Company Deferred Compensation Plans and take such
other actions as are necessary to provide for the treatment of the Company
Deferred Awards and Company Cash Awards as contemplated by this _Section
2.3_.

(i) _Plans and Awards Assumed by Parent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume all rights and obligations in respect of each Company Equity Plan and
each Company Deferred Compensation Plan, including each outstanding Company
Equity Award, Company Deferred Award and Company Cash Award, and will be able
to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible by applicable Law under the
terms of the Company Equity Plans if Parent elects to assume the share
reserves of such Company Equity Plans as of the Effective Time, except that:
(i) stock covered by such awards shall be Parent Shares; (ii) all references
in such Company

 



10  Equity Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be amended
or deemed amended to refer instead to a number of Parent Shares determined by
multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the
Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole
number of Parent Shares; and (iii) the Parent Board of Directors or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof with respect to the
administration of such Company Equity Plan.

 

(j) _Parent Actions_. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a number of authorized but unissued Parent Shares for
delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Parent Share Options, Parent Share
Appreciation Rights, Parent Restricted Stock Awards, Parent RSU Awards and
Parent PSU Awards that are converted in accordance with this  _Section 2.3_.
The Company and Parent shall cooperate in connection with the preparation of
registration statements on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form, including a Form S-1 or Form S-3 in the case of awards held by former
employees and service providers of the Company) with respect to the Parent
Shares subject to such awards, in order to file such forms effective as of the
Effective Time or, in the event the necessary financial information required
for such filings is not filed or able to be filed with the SEC as of the
Effective Time, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time. In addition, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such awards remain outstanding.

 

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Parent Equity Awards_. Concurrently with the Parent
Share Consolidation:

 

(a) _Parent Share Options_. Each Parent Share Option, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Parent Share Consolidation shall be adjusted to be a Parent Share Option to
acquire (i) that number of whole Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of
Parent Shares subject to such Parent Share Option as of immediately prior to
the Parent Share Consolidation by (B) the Share Consolidation Ratio, (ii) at
an exercise price per Parent Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the exercise price per Parent
Share of such Parent Share Option by (B) the Share Consolidation Ratio;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each such Parent Share Option that is an
"incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be
adjusted in accordance with the foregoing in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code. The Parties intend that the
adjustments in this  _Section 2.4(a)_ are in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and will not subject any Parent Share
Option to Section 409A of the Code. Except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 2.4(a)_, each such Parent Share Option adjusted pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(a)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same
terms and conditions as applied to the Parent Share Option as of immediately
prior to the Parent Share Consolidation.

(b) _Parent RSU Awards_. Each Parent RSU Award that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Parent Share Consolidation shall be adjusted to
correspond to a number of Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole share)
equal to the product obtained by multiplying

 



11  (i) the number of Parent Shares subject to such Parent RSU Award as of
immediately prior to the Parent Share Consolidation by (ii) the Share
Consolidation Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.4(b)_,
each Parent RSU Award adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_ shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the Parent RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(c) _Parent PSU Awards_. Each performance share unit award that corresponds to
a number of Parent Shares granted under a Parent Equity Plan (each, a "
_Parent PSU Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Parent Share Consolidation, shall be converted into a Parent RSU Award with
respect to a number of Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole share)
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Parent Shares
subject to such Parent PSU Award as of immediately prior to the Parent Share
Consolidation, determined based upon the greater of target and actual
performance (as determined by Parent in its reasonable discretion) measured as
of a date that is on or about the Effective Time determined by Parent in its
reasonable discretion, by (ii) the Share Consolidation Ratio. Except as
otherwise provided in this _Section 2.4(c)_, each Parent PSU Award converted
into a Parent RSU Award pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_ shall continue to
have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including
service-vesting conditions, but excluding performance adjustments) as applied
to the Parent PSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Parent Deferred Share Unit Awards_. Each deferred stock unit that
corresponds to a number of Parent Shares granted under a Parent Equity Plan
(each, a " _Parent DSU Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Parent Share Consolidation shall be adjusted by multiplying (i) the number of
Parent Shares subject to such Parent DSU Award as of immediately prior to the
Parent Share Consolidation by (ii) the Share Consolidation Ratio. Except as
otherwise provided in this _Section 2.4(d)_, each Parent DSU Award adjusted
pursuant to this _Section 2.4(d)_ shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Parent DSU Award
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(e) _Parent Actions_. Prior to the Share Consolidation, Parent shall pass
resolutions, provide any notices, obtain any consents, make any amendments to
the Parent Equity Plans or Parent Equity Awards and take such other actions as
are necessary to provide for the equitable adjustment of the Parent Share
Options, Parent RSU Awards, Parent PSU Awards and Parent DSU Awards
(collectively, " _Parent Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section
2.4_.

Section 2.5 _Company ESPPs; Company Dividend Reinvestment Plan_.

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all rights and obligations in
respect of each Company ESPP and each Company ESPP shall continue in
accordance with its terms, subject to any amendments Parent deems necessary or
advisable in accordance with applicable Law, except that: (a) stock covered by
such Company ESPP shall be Parent Shares; (b) all references in such Company
ESPP to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be amended or deemed
amended to refer instead to a number of Parent Shares determined by
multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the
Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole
number of Parent Shares; and (c) the Parent Board of Directors or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof with respect to the
administration of such Company ESPP.

 



12 (b) The Company shall take such action as is necessary to provide that as of
no later than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date, no Company
Shares will be purchased under the Companys dividend reinvestment plan;
_provided_ that such cessation of purchases following the Closing Date shall
be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.

Section 2.6 _Withholding_. The Company, Parent, any applicable Parent
Subsidiary, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts that are
required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such consideration under
the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely remitted to the
appropriate Relevant Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.7 _Fractional Shares_.

 

(a) No certificate or scrip representing fractional Parent Shares shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
or upon the effectuation of the Parent Share Consolidation, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote, to
dividends or to any other rights in respect of such fractional shares of a
shareholder of Parent. 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Company Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Share (after aggregating all
Company Shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered
by such holder), shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (i)
the closing price of the Company Shares reported on the NYSE on the trading
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, rounded to the nearest one-
hundredth of a cent, by (ii) the fraction of a Parent Share (after taking
into account all Company Shares held by such holder at the Effective Time and
rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled (the " _Fractional Share
Consideration_ "). The Parties acknowledge that payment of cash consideration
in lieu of issuing fractional Parent Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.7(b)_
is merely intended to provide a mechanical rounding off and is not a
separately bargained-for consideration.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Parent Shares immediately prior to the effectuation of the Parent Share
Consolidation (an " _Existing Parent Holder_ ") who, as a result of the Parent
Share Consolidation, would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction
of a Parent Share (after aggregating all shares held by such Existing Parent
Holder), shall receive, in lieu of any fraction of a Parent Share an Existing
Parent Holder would otherwise have been entitled to receive, cash (without
interest) in an amount determined in accordance with this _Section 2.7(c)_.
As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Parents existing
transfer agent or another transfer agent designated by Parent (the 

 



13  " _Transfer Agent_ ") shall determine the aggregate number of Parent Shares
in lieu of which Existing Parent Holders would receive cash pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence (such excess being herein referred to as the "
_Excess Shares_ "). In order to fund the payment of such cash, as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time, the Transfer Agent, as agent for
such Existing Parent Holders, shall sell the Excess Shares at then-prevailing
prices on the NYSE, all in the manner provided herein. The sale of the Excess
Shares by the Transfer Agent shall be executed on the NYSE and shall be
executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of
any such sale or sales have been distributed to Existing Parent Holders, the
Transfer Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such Existing Parent
Holders. The net proceeds of any such sale or sales of Excess Shares to
be distributed to Existing Parent Holders shall be reduced by any and all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, as well
as any expenses, of the Transfer Agent incurred in connection with such sale
or sales. The Transfer Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds
to which each Existing Parent Holder shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying
the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such Existing Parent
Holder is entitled (after taking into account all Parent Shares held by such
Existing Parent Holder immediately prior to the effectuation of the Parent
Share Consolidation) and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of
Excess Shares. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to Existing Parent Holders with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Transfer Agent shall promptly pay
such amounts to such holders subject to and in accordance with this _Section
2.7(c)_. The Parties acknowledge that payment of cash consideration in lieu of
issuing fractional Parent Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.7(c)_ is
merely intended to provide a mechanical rounding off and is not a separately
bargained-for consideration.

Section 2.8 _No Dissenters  Rights_. Pursuant to Section 180.1302(4) of the
WBCL, holders of Company Shares will not have dissenters rights with respect
to the Merger.

 

Section 2.9 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of Company Shares
(other than (x) Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section
2.1(c)_ and (y) Company Shares to be converted in accordance with _Section
2.1(d)_ or _Section 2.1(e)_) (a " _Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject
to the limitations set forth in this _Article II_ , to submit an election on
or prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this _Section 2.9_.

 

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.9_ (an " _Election_ ") (i) the number of
Company Shares owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires
to make a Share Election, (ii) the number of such Company Shares with respect
to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election and (iii) the particular
shares for which the Holder desires to make either such election, and the
order in which either such election is to apply to any such shares if the
election is subject to proration under _Section 2.1(b)_.

(b) The Company shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to Parent (the "
_Form of Election_ "), which shall be mailed by the Company to Holders so as
to permit such Holders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to
the Election Deadline.

 



14 (c) The Company shall mail or cause to be mailed or delivered, as applicable,
the Form of Election to Holders as of the record date for the Company Special
Meeting not less than twenty (20) business days prior to the anticipated
Election Deadline. The Company shall make available one or more Forms of
Election as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who
become Holders during the period following the record date for the Company
Special Meeting and prior to the Election Deadline.

 

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly
completed and signed and accompanied by (i) the Certificates, if any, to which
such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form
acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company, and (ii) in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents specified in the procedures
set forth in the Form of Election. As used herein, " _Election Deadline_ "
means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the
Exchange Agent is located) on the date of the Company Special Meeting, unless
otherwise agreed in advance by the Company and Parent, in which event the
Company shall reasonably promptly announce such rescheduled Election Deadline.

 

(e) Any Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or
revoke such Holders Election by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and
signed revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the Election
Deadline of such Holders Certificates, or any documents in respect of Book-
Entry Shares, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. After an Election
is validly made with respect to any Company Shares, any subsequent transfer of
such Company Shares shall automatically revoke such Election. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Elections shall be
automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written
notification from the Company or Parent that this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_. The Exchange Agent shall have

disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that
all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the

accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). The Companys internal
controls over financial reporting are effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and

the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and

unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
could have a material effect on its financial statements.

(b) Since September 30, 2013, none of the Company, the Companys independent
accountants, the Company Board of Directors or its audit committee has
received any oral or written notification of any (i) significant deficiency or
material weakness in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that is reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information or (ii) fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting, in each case that has not been appropriately
and adequately remedied by the Company.

adjustments which are not material and to any other adjustments described
therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP (except, in the

and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that
it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant
to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents internal controls
over financial reporting are effective in providing reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of Parents financial reporting and the preparation
of Parent financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP
and include policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent, (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that
receipts and expenditures of Parent are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of Parent, and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Parents assets that could have a material
effect on its financial statements.

 

(b) Since September 30, 2013, none of Parent, Parents independent
accountants, the Parent Board of Directors or its audit committee has
received any oral or written notification of any (i) significant deficiency or
material weakness in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that is reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information or
(ii) fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal control over
financial reporting, in each case that has not been appropriately and
adequately remedied by Parent.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_, if the
Company receives a written Company Competing Proposal and the Company Board
of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that (i) such Company Competing
Proposal, inquiry or proposal either constitutes a Company Superior Proposal
or could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal and
(ii) the failure to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) below
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, and which Company Competing Proposal, inquiry or
proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise
result from a breach of this  _Section 5.3_, the Company may take any or all
of the following actions: (A) furnish nonpublic information to the third party
making or intending to make such Company Competing Proposal ( _provided_ that
all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to
Parent substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person(s)), if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the
Company receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement
that includes terms that are no less restrictive of such Person than the terms
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with the third party with respect to such Company Competing
Proposal. The Company (1) shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours of receipt) notify Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of
any Company Competing Proposal or any initial communication or proposal that
may reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Competing Proposal and shall,
in the case of any such notice to Parent as to receipt of a Company Competing
Proposal or such a proposal, set forth the material terms and conditions of
such Company Competing Proposal or such proposal (including any changes to
such material terms and conditions) and the identity of the Person making any
such Company Competing Proposal and (2) thereafter shall promptly keep Parent
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material change to
the terms and status of any such Company Competing Proposal. Without limiting
the generality of _clause (2)_ of the preceding sentence, the Company shall
provide to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt or
delivery) copies of any written Company Competing Proposal and all written
material received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary from the Person
making a Company Competing Proposal (or such Persons Representatives) that is
material to understanding such Company Competing Proposal and of all written
non-public material provided by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the
Person making a Company Competing Proposal (or such Persons Representatives)
that was

 



62  not previously provided to Parent and is related to such Company Competing
Proposal or is being provided pursuant to the confidentiality agreement
executed by the Company and such Person, including draft agreements or term
sheets received in connection therewith. The Company shall not, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or other
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that
prohibits the Company from complying with its obligations under this
Agreement, including providing such information to Parent.

 

(c) Except as set forth in _Sections 5.3(d)_ , _(e)_ and _(f)_ , neither the
Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw
or fail to make when required pursuant to this Agreement (or qualify or modify
in any manner adverse to Parent), propose publicly to withdraw or fail to make
when required pursuant to this Agreement (or qualify or modify in any manner
adverse to Parent) or fail to include in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
the Company Board Recommendation, or (B) approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable,
any Company Competing Proposal (any action in this _subclause (i)_ being
referred to as a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ ") (it being agreed that
(x) no "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act in and of itself shall constitute a Company Change of
Recommendation and (y) the provision by the Company to Parent of notice or
information in connection with a Company Competing Proposal or Company
Superior Proposal as required or expressly permitted by this Agreement shall
not, in and of itself, constitute a Company Change of Recommendation) or (ii)
cause or allow the Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, transaction agreement, implementation
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement constituting or with
respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company
Competing Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company
to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate the Merger (other than a
confidentiality agreement as contemplated by _Section 5.3(b)_).

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board of
Directors, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval,
from making a Company Change of Recommendation if the Company Board of
Directors has concluded in good faith (after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) (i) that a Company Competing
Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (ii) that the failure to
make a Company Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall have provided prior written
notice to Parent, at least three (3) business days in advance, of the Company
Board of Directors intention to make such Company Change of Recommendation (
_provided_ , that in the event of a subsequent modification of the material
terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal, such period shall be
reduced to two (2) business days); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company Board of Directors shall take into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such prior written notice or
otherwise, and during such three (3) business day period or two (2) business
day period, as applicable, the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations
with Parent regarding any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if any Company Competing Proposal is
received less than three (3) business days or two (2) business

 



63  days, as applicable, prior to the Company Special Meeting, the three (3)
business day period or two (2) business day period, as applicable,
contemplated in this  _Section 5.3(d)_ shall be shortened such that it will
expire as of the close of business on the day preceding the Company Special
Meeting.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board of
Directors, in response to a Company Intervening Event, from making a Company
Change of Recommendation at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval if the Company Board of Directors has concluded in good
faith (after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall have provided prior written notice to
Parent, at least ten (10) business days in advance, of the Company Board of
Directors intention to make such Company Change of Recommendation and the
reasons therefor; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Board of
Directors shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
or other mitigating factors or structural changes proposed by Parent in
response to such prior written notice or otherwise, and during such ten (10)
business day period the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with
Parent regarding any changes to the terms of this Agreement or other
mitigating factors or structural changes proposed by Parent; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if any Company Intervening Event occurs less than ten (10)
business days prior to the Company Special Meeting, the ten (10) business day
period contemplated in this _Section 5.3(e)_ shall be shortened such that it
will expire as of the close of business on the day preceding the Company
Special Meeting. Notwithstanding any Company Change of Recommendation, unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the
Company shall hold the Company Special Meeting in accordance with  _Section
5.5_ for purposes of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company
or the Company Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the
Company shareholders a position or making a statement contemplated by Rule
14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Company shareholders if in the good faith judgment of the Company Board of
Directors (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel),
failure to so disclose and/or take would give rise to a violation of
applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure of a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
or any other disclosure that relates to the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Company Board of Directors with respect to
a Company Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Change of
Recommendation unless the Company, in connection with such disclosure, (A)
publicly states that the Company Board of Directors expressly rejects the
applicable Company Competing Proposal or expressly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation or (B) does not publicly state that the Company Board of
Directors recommends acceptance of the applicable Company Competing Proposal
( _provided_ that this _clause (B)_ shall apply only if such disclosure is
made at a time when the Company has provided notice to Parent of its intention
to make a Company Change of Recommendation and the Company Board of Directors
is not yet permitted to effect such Company Change of Recommendation,
_provided_ , _further_ , that if, within two (2) business days following the
date on which the Company Board of Directors is permitted to effect
such Company Change of Recommendation, the Company Board of Directors does
not expressly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, the Company Board of
Directors shall thereupon be deemed to make a Company Change of
Recommendation).

 



64 (g) For purposes of this _Section 5.3_, (i) the term " _Person_ " means any
Person or "group," as used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than,
with respect to the Company, Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries, and (ii)
references to the "Company Board of Directors" shall mean the Company Board
of Directors or, to the extent applicable, a duly authorized committee
thereof.

Section 5.4 _Solicitation by Parent_.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, Parent agrees that it shall not (and shall not
permit any Parent Subsidiary to), and that it shall direct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any
inquiry with respect to, or the making or submission of any inquiry, proposal
or offer (including any inquiry, proposal or offer to its shareholders) which
constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to, a Parent Competing
Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding a
Parent Competing Proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic information
in furtherance of a Parent Competing Proposal to, any Person that has made
or, to Parents knowledge, is considering making a Parent Competing Proposal
(except to notify such Person as to the existence of the provisions of this 
_Section 5.4_); or (iii) waive, terminate, modify or release any Person
(other than the Company and its Affiliates) from any provision of or grant any
permission, waiver or request under any "standstill" or similar agreement or
obligation ( _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to take, or be
prohibited from taking, any action otherwise prohibited or required under this
_subclause (iii)_ if the Parent Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with Parents outside legal advisors) that such
action or inaction would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law). Parent shall, and shall
cause the Parent Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent
Competing Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be
expected to lead to a Parent Competing Proposal, request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished in connection
therewith and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room
access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in  _Section 5.4(a)_, if
Parent receives a written Parent Competing Proposal and the Parent Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with Parents financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) that (i) such Parent Competing Proposal,
inquiry or proposal either constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Superior Proposal and (ii) the
failure to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) below would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and which Parent Competing Proposal, inquiry or proposal
was made after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this _Section 5.4_, Parent may take any or all of the following
actions: (A) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making or
intending to make such Parent 

 



65  Competing Proposal ( _provided_ that all such information has previously
been provided to the Company or is provided to the Company substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person(s)), if, and only
if, prior to so furnishing such information, Parent receives from the third
party an executed confidentiality agreement that includes terms that are no
less restrictive of such Person than the terms contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations
with the third party with respect to such Parent Competing Proposal. Parent
(1) shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt)
notify the Company orally and in writing of the receipt of any Parent
Competing Proposal or any initial communication or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Competing Proposal and shall, in
the case of any such notice to the Company as to receipt of a Parent
Competing Proposal or such a proposal, set forth the material terms and
conditions of such Parent Competing Proposal or such proposal (including any
changes to such material terms and conditions) and the identity of the Person
making any such Parent Competing Proposal and (2) thereafter shall promptly
keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any
material change to the terms and status of any such Parent Competing
Proposal. Without limiting the generality of _clause (2)_ of the preceding
sentence, Parent shall provide to the Company as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours of receipt or delivery) copies of any written Parent
Competing Proposal and all written material received by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiaries from the Person making a Parent Competing Proposal (or such
Persons Representatives) that is material to understanding to such Parent
Competing Proposal and of all written non-public material provided by Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary to the Person making a Parent Competing Proposal (or
such Persons Representatives) that was not previously provided to the
Company and is related to such Parent Competing Proposal or is being provided
pursuant to the confidentiality agreement executed by Parent and such Person,
including draft agreements or term sheets received in connection
therewith. Parent shall not, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries not to,
enter into any confidentiality or other agreement with any Person subsequent
to the date of this Agreement that prohibits Parent from complying with its
obligations under this Agreement, including providing such information to the
Company.

(c) Except as set forth in _Sections 5.4(d)_ , _(e)_ and  _(f)_ , neither
the Parent Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw
or fail to make when required pursuant to this Agreement (or qualify or modify
in any manner adverse to the Company), propose publicly to withdraw or fail
to make when required pursuant to this Agreement (or qualify or modify in any
manner adverse to the Company) or fail to include in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Parent Board Recommendation, or (B) approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or
declare advisable, any Parent Competing Proposal (any action in this
_subclause (i)_ being referred to as a " _Parent Change of Recommendation_ ")
(it being agreed that (x) no "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act in and of itself shall constitute a
Parent Change of Recommendation and, (y) the provision by Parent to the
Company of notice or information in connection with a Parent Competing
Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal as required or expressly permitted by
this Agreement shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Parent Change of
Recommendation) or (ii) cause or allow Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, transaction
agreement, implementation agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
constituting or with respect

 



66  to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Parent Competing
Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, Parent to abandon,
terminate, delay or fail to consummate the Merger (other than a
confidentiality agreement as contemplated by _Section 5.4(b)_).

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Parent Board of
Directors, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Required
Approvals, from making a Parent Change of Recommendation if the Parent Board
of Directors has concluded in good faith (after consultation with Parents
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) (i) that a Parent Competing
Proposal constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal and (ii) that the failure to
make a Parent Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have provided prior written notice
to the Company, at least three (3) business days in advance, of the Parent
Board of Directors intention to make such Parent Change of Recommendation (

terms and conditions of such Parent Superior Proposal, such period shall be
reduced to two (2) business days); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Parent Board of Directors shall take into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by the Company in response to such prior
written notice or otherwise, and during such three (3) business day period or
two (2) business day period, as applicable, Parent shall engage in good faith
negotiations with the Company regarding any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by the Company; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if any
Parent Competing Proposal is received less than three (3) business days or two
(2) business days, as applicable, prior to the Parent Special Meeting, the
three (3) business day period or two (2) business day period, as applicable,
contemplated in this _Section 5.4(d)_ shall be shortened such that it will
expire as of the close of business on the day preceding the Parent Special
Meeting. 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Parent Board of
Directors, in response to a Parent Intervening Event, from making a Parent
Change of Recommendation at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder
Required Approvals if the Parent Board of Directors has concluded in good
faith (after consultation with Parents financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall have provided prior written notice to the Company, at
least ten (10) business days in advance, of the Parent Board of Directors
intention to make such Parent Change of Recommendation and the reasons
therefor; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Parent Board of Directors
shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement or other
mitigating factors or structural changes proposed by the Company in response
to such prior written notice or otherwise, and during such ten (10) business
day period, Parent shall engage in good faith negotiations with the Company
regarding any changes to the terms of this Agreement or other mitigating
factors or structural changes proposed by the Company; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if any Parent Intervening Event occurs less than ten (10)
business days prior to the Parent Special Meeting, the ten (10) business day

shareholders if in the good faith judgment of the Parent Board of Directors
(after consultation with Parents outside legal counsel), failure to so
disclose or take would give rise to a violation of applicable Law; _provided_
, _however_ , that any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or any other disclosure that
relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Parent Board of Directors with respect to a Parent Competing Proposal shall be
deemed to be a Parent Change of Recommendation unless Parent, in connection
with such disclosure, (A) publicly states that the Parent Board of Directors
expressly rejects the applicable Parent Competing Proposal or expressly
reaffirms the Parent Board Recommendation or (B) does not publicly state that
the Parent Board of Directors recommends acceptance of the applicable
Parent Competing Proposal ( _provided_ that this _clause (B)_ shall apply
only if such disclosure is made at a time when Parent has provided notice to
the Company of its intention to make a Parent Change of Recommendation and the
Parent Board of Directors is not yet permitted to effect such Parent Change
of Recommendation, _provided_ , _further_ , that if, within two (2) business
days following the date on which the Parent Board of Directors is permitted to

Section 5.5 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, (i) the
Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in preliminary form, and (ii) Parent
shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4 with respect to
the Parent Shares issuable in the Merger, which will include the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus with respect to the Company Special Meeting and
Parent Special Meeting, with such filings to be made as mutually agreed by
Parent and the Company in good faith. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, (B) ensure
that the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, (C) include in the Form S-4
any information required to be included by the Irish Takeover Rules and (D)

68  effective for so long as is necessary to complete the Transactions. Each of

Affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other and provide such other
assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
The Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include all
information reasonably requested by such other Party to be included therein.
Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the

thereof, provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it and
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all
written comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4 received from the SEC and advise the other party of any oral comments
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received
from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comment
from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each
of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in advance
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and shall
not so file or mail, or respond, as applicable, without the consent of both
Parent and the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that with respect to documents filed by a
party that are incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval shall apply only with respect
to information relating to the other party or its business, financial
condition or results of operations, or the combined entity; _provided_ ,

any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any
such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection
with the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger, and the
Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders
of the Company Shares as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such actions.

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval
or the Parent Shareholder Required Approvals, any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates is discovered by the
Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Form S-4
and/or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they

 



69  were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate
in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or
supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 and, to
the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to shareholders of the Company and the shareholders
of Parent. Nothing in this _Section 5.5(b)_ shall limit the obligations of
any Party under _Section 5.5(a)_. For purposes of this _Section 5.5_, any
information concerning or related to the Company, its Affiliates or the
Company Special Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company,
and any information concerning or related to Parent, its Affiliates or the
Parent Special Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act, the Company and Parent agree to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to their respective shareholders entitled to
vote at the Company Special Meeting or the Parent Special Meeting, as
applicable, and to cause the Company Special Meeting and the Parent Special
Meeting, as applicable, to be held as soon as reasonably practicable
following such mailing. The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to hold the Company Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting on
the same date. Each Party shall cooperate and keep the other Party informed
on a current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results
following the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the
shareholders of each Party.

 

(d) The Company shall take all necessary actions to establish a record date
for, and to duly call, give notice of, and convene the Company Special
Meeting in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Governing Documents.
The Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors, recommend to its
shareholders that they give the Company Shareholder Approval, include
such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and solicit and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval,
except in each case to the extent that the Company Board of Directors shall
have made a Company Change of Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.3_.

(e) Parent shall take all necessary actions to establish a record date for,
and to duly call, give notice of, and convene the Parent Special Meeting in
accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Memorandum and Articles of
Association. Parent shall, through the Parent Board of Directors, recommend to
its shareholders that they give the Parent Shareholder Approvals, include
such recommendations in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and solicit and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approvals,
except in each case to the extent that the Parent Board of Directors shall
have made a Parent Change of Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.4_.

(f) The Company and Parent shall adjourn or postpone the Company Special
Meeting or the Parent Special Meeting, as applicable, if, as of the time for
which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient Company
Shares or Parent Shares, as applicable, represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or if on the date of such meeting, the Company or Parent has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Required
Approvals, as applicable, and, except to the extent

 



70  that the Company Board of Directors shall have made a Company Change of
Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.3_ or the Parent Board of Directors
shall have made a Parent Change of Recommendation as permitted by _Section
5.4_, as applicable, the Company and Parent shall continue to use all
reasonable best efforts to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
shareholders relating to the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent
Shareholder Required Approvals, as applicable. The Company and Parent shall
only be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting or the
Parent Special Meeting, as applicable, twice pursuant to this  _Section
5.5(f)_, in each case for not more than thirty (30) days after the date when
the Company Special Meeting or the Parent Special Meeting, as applicable, was
scheduled to be held prior to such adjournment or
postponement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
5.5(f)_, in no event shall the Company or Parent be required to adjourn or
postpone the Company Special Meeting or the Parent Special Meeting, as
applicable, if such adjournment or postponement would require the Company or
Parent, as applicable, to establish a new record date.

Section 5.6 _Irish Prospectus_. If an Irish Prospectus is required under
applicable Law, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file with the CBI for its approval a
draft copy of the Irish Prospectus (together with any application to the CBI
for passporting such prospectus into any other required European Economic Area
jurisdiction), and Parent shall cause the Irish Prospectus to comply as to
form and substance in all material respects with the requirements of Irish
Prospectus Law. The Company shall furnish all information concerning itself,
its Affiliates and the shareholders of the Company to Parent and provide such
other assistance as may be reasonably requested to determine whether
the Irish Prospectus is required under applicable Law (including any
requirement to passport such prospectus into other European Economic Area
jurisdictions), and as otherwise may reasonably be required in respect of the
preparation and approval of the Irish Prospectus. Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain formal approval of the Irish Prospectus including
supplying all such information, executing all such documents and paying all
such fees as may be reasonably necessary or required by the CBI for the
purposes of obtaining such approval. If any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered
by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company
or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the
Irish Prospectus so that it would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other Party, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt
filing with the CBI of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the
Irish Prospectus, and to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to the shareholders of
the Company. As promptly as practicable after the Irish Prospectus
is approved by the CBI, Parent shall procure that the directors of Parent
publish the Irish Prospectus in accordance with applicable Law. Parent shall
promptly advise the Company upon becoming aware of (i) the time when the Irish
Prospectus has been approved by the CBI or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, (ii) any comments, responses or requests from the CBI relating to
drafts of the Irish Prospectus or (iii) any matter referred to in Regulation
51 of the Irish Prospectus Regulations which arises between the time that the
Irish Prospectus is formally approved and the Closing. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
from the CBI relating to drafts of the Irish Prospectus. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the Irish Prospectus or responding to any comments
of the CBI with respect thereto, Parent shall cooperate with the Company and
provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response in advance (including the proposed final version of such
document or response).

 



71 Section 5.7 _Spin Off; Separation Agreement_.

 

(a) The Company shall provide Parent with reasonable access to information
regarding the Spin Off (including by making appropriate employees and outside
advisors reasonably available to discuss and respond to all reasonable
requests relating to the Spin Off), keep Parent reasonably informed of any
material decisions made by the Company with respect to the Spin Off (including
by providing to Parent, as promptly as practicable, with a detailed
restructuring schedule or steps plan setting forth the actions proposed to be
taken in order to effect the Spin Off and related tax planning, and the
anticipated timing for completing such actions, by informing Parent of any
material modifications to and material departures from such schedule or plan
and by considering in good faith any comments Parent may have with respect
thereto); _provided_ , that, if required in order to avoid the loss of any
attorney client, attorney work product or other legal privilege with respect
to information that is subject to such legal privilege, the Parties shall
enter into a common interest or joint defense agreement in customary
form, prior to receiving such privileged information.

(b) Prior to the filing of the Form 10 or any amendment or supplement thereto,
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of such filing (including all
exhibits to be filed therewith) and provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all such documents. The Company shall
consider in good faith any comments Parent may have with respect to such
filing (or the exhibits thereto) and cooperate in good faith to make
appropriate revisions. If Parent disagrees with any material matters in any
such filing or any exhibit to be filed therewith (including any form
of separation or other agreements), Parent may raise such objection with the
Company not later than one (1) week following receipt by Parent of such filing
or exhibit and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such
objections;  _provided_ that such objection shall not relate to any of the
matters set forth in Section 5.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(c) The Company shall not file the Form 10 or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or enter into any agreement the form of which will be filed as an
exhibit to the Form 10, in each case that contains terms that are materially
inconsistent with the matters set forth in Section 5.7 of the Company
Disclosure Letter without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 6.1 _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section 8.1_, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall,
and shall cause each of the Company

 



72  Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, to afford to the
other Party and to the Representatives of such other Party reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of
their respective properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments, personnel
and records (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form) and, during
such period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of
the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, to,
furnish reasonably promptly to the other Party any and all information
(financial or otherwise) concerning its and its Subsidiaries
business, properties and personnel as such other Party may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent shall
be required by this _Section 6.1_ to provide the other Party or the
Representatives of such other Party with access to or to disclose information
(i) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third
party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after
the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure), (ii) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or duty (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of any Law or duty) or (iii) that is subject to
any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts, including entering into a common defense or common interest, or
other similar agreement, to allow for such access or disclosure to the
maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege); _provided_ , _however_ , that
such access and information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to
external counsel for Parent to the extent reasonably required for the purpose
of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws subject to prior execution of a
common interest or joint defense agreement in customary form. If any material
is withheld by a Party pursuant to the preceding sentence, such Party shall
(subject to the preceding sentence) inform the other Party as to the general
nature of what is being withheld to the extent permitted under applicable
Law. Each of the Company and Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other Party that may
result from the requests for access, data and information hereunder. 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.1_, in confidence to
the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with,
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Relevant Authority in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions, or from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if
the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such Party to
obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any legal proceeding commenced or, to any
Partys knowledge, threatened against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case in connection with,
arising from or otherwise relating to the Transaction, (iii) in the case of
Parent, of any notice or other communication received by Parent from any
Person requisitioning the convening of a meeting of the holders of

 



73  Parent Shares, (iv) in the case of the Company, of any notice or other
communication received by the Company from any Person calling for a meeting of
the holders of Company Shares, and (v) upon becoming aware of the occurrence
or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it or any of
the Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may
be, or which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or
impede the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _ however_ , that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.1(c)_ shall not cure
any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such
matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to any Party. The failure to deliver any such
notice by itself shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ or give rise to any right to terminate under _Article VIII_.

 

Section 6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and make effective the Transactions,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, including (i)
preparing and filing, in consultation with the other Party and as promptly as
advisable after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents and to obtain as
promptly as reasonably practicable all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations,
approvals, permits, and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained
from any third party and/or any Relevant Authority in order to consummate the
Merger or any of the other Transactions (including those set forth in Section
6.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or Section 6.2(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter) and (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain
all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances,
waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and
approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party
agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and advisable. Each Party agrees to supply, as promptly as
practicable and advisable, any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Law.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in _Section 6.2(a)_ to obtain all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations,
approvals, permits, and authorizations for the Transactions, (i) cooperate in
all respects and consult with each other in connection with any filing
or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, including by allowing
the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and
comment on drafts of filings and submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other
Party of any substantive or material communication received by such Party
from, or given by such Party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any
other Relevant Authority, by promptly providing copies to the other Party of
any such written communications, and of any material communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the Transactions; (iii) permit the other Party to review in
advance

 



74  any written communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in
advance of any substantive or material meeting, substantive or material
telephone call or substantive or material conference with, the DOJ, the FTC
or any other Relevant Authority, or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person regarding any of the Transactions (
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that materials exchanged under (i), (ii) and (iii)
may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent,
the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements in effect as of the date hereof and (C) as necessary
to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns); and (iv) to the
extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or any other applicable Relevant
Authority or other Person, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate in any in-person meetings with the DOJ, the FTC or any other
Relevant Authority or other Person. With respect to any materials required to
be given by either Party to the other Party pursuant to this  _Section
6.2(b)_, such first Party may give such materials to such second Partys
outside counsel, instead of directly to such second Party. The Parties may, as
they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively
sensitive materials provided to the other under this _Section 6.2(b)_ as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and shall not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient without the advance written consent of the Party providing such
materials or its counsel. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of the Parties contained in  _Section 6.2(a)_ and this _Section
6.2(b)_, each Party shall take any and all actions as may be necessary or
advisable to obtain the expiration or termination of any waiting period or any
consents, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required
under any Antitrust Law in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable and to resolve objections,
if any, as may be asserted with respect to the Transactions under
any Antitrust Law as promptly as reasonably practicable including, in each
case, agreeing to any terms, conditions or modifications (including Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries having to cease operating,
license, sell or otherwise dispose of any assets or businesses (including the
requirement that any such assets or businesses be held separate) or limiting
their respective freedom of action); _provided_ , _however_ , neither the
Company nor Parent shall be required to take, and neither the Company nor
Parent shall take without prior written consent of the other Party, such
actions under this _Section 6.2_ as would result in, or would be reasonably
likely to result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the business, the results of operations or the condition
(financial or otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each
case, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. Nothing in this
_Section 6.2(b)_ shall require Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business
or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon the Closing. The Parties shall jointly develop the strategy
relating to the Antitrust Laws and consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, regarding the form and
content of any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either
Party in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law
prior to their submission.

 



75 (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the expiration or termination of all waiting periods and all consents,
waivers, authorizations and approvals of all Relevant Authorities and other
third parties necessary, proper or advisable for the consummation of the
Transactions and to provide any notices to third parties required to be
provided prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, without the prior
written consent of the other Party, neither Party shall pay any material fee,
penalty or other consideration (other than customary filing or application
fees), incur any significant expense or liability, enter into any significant
new commitment or agreement or agree to any significant modification to any
contractual arrangement in connection with such waiting periods, consents,
waivers, authorizations or approvals.

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with
respect to the Transactions or this Agreement without the prior consent of the
other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless such Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it
is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing
rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect
to the Transactions or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall
endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide
a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon such
press release or other announcement in advance and shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto; _provided_ , _ however_ , that the Company shall not be required by
this _Section 6.3_ to provide any such review or comment to Parent in
connection with the receipt and existence of a Company Competing Proposal or a
Company Change of Recommendation and matters related thereto; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required by this _Section
6.3_ to provide any such review or comment to the Company in connection with
the receipt and existence of a Parent Competing Proposal or a Parent Change
of Recommendation and matters related thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that
each Party and their respective Affiliates may make statements that are
substantially similar to previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this
_Section 6.3_.

 

Section 6.4 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. For not
less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all
individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time are past or present
directors, officers or employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
and each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Company Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by Law; _provided_ that such Company Indemnified
Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to which a court of competent
jurisdiction has determined in a final, nonappealable adjudication such
Company Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit
or proceeding in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions

the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in

 



76  connection with such Persons serving as an officer, director, employee or

the benefit of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent
Indemnified Parties_ " and, together with the Company Indemnified Parties, the
" _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual
or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Parent
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law; _provided_ that
such Parent Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to
which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final,
nonappealable adjudication such Parent Indemnified Party is not ultimately
entitled), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or omissions occurring
or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts
or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in connection
with such Persons serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary
of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or of any Person if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by Law or provided pursuant to
the Parent Memorandum and Articles of Association or the organizational
documents of any Parent Subsidiary or any indemnification agreements, if any,

acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided
in their respective articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect. For six (6) years after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, shall
cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (a) the Company Governing
Documents and the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary and (b)
any other agreements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with any
Company Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination of liability,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement, and no such
provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such Company
Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions). For six (6)
years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect
the provisions in (A) the Parent Memorandum and

 



77 Articles of Association and the organizational documents of any Parent
Subsidiary and (B) any other agreements of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
with any Parent Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination of
liability, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement,
and no such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such
Parent Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions). Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate period of not
less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, for the benefit of the
current or former directors and officers of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries an insurance and indemnification policy covering each such
Person covered by the officers and directors liability policies of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company D andO Insurance_") that
is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy or, if insurance
coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to pay an annual premium for the Company DandO Insurance in excess
of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date of this Agreement (it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be
obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for such three
hundred percent (300%) amount); _provided_ _further_ that either the Surviving
Corporation or the Company may prior to the Effective Time substitute therefor
a single premium tail coverage with respect to the Company DandO Insurance with
an annual cost not in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement. Parent shall provide,
for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective
Time, for the benefit of the current or former directors and officers of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries an insurance and indemnification policy
covering each such Person covered by the officers and directors liability
policies of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries that provides coverage for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _Parent D andO Insurance_")
that is no less favorable than the Parents existing policy or, if insurance
coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to pay an
annual premium for the Parent DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred
percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement (it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide as much coverage as may be obtained for such three hundred percent
(300%) amount). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, the provisions of this
_Section 6.4_ shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the
final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and
proceedings relating thereto. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_. The rights and
obligations under this _Section 6.4_ shall survive consummation of the Merger
and shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any
Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified Party. The
provisions of this _Section 6.4_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or
her legal representatives.

reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Transactions and (b) if any such

of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

80 Section 6.11 _Employment and Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) _Compensation and Benefit Continuation_. For the period commencing on the
Effective Time and ending on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
Company Employee and Parent Employee who, in each case, is not employed within
a bargaining unit that is represented by a union, labor organization,
or works council (i) base compensation that is no less favorable to such
Company Employee or Parent Employee than the base compensation provided to the
applicable Company Employee or Parent Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time; (ii) annual cash incentive opportunities and cash-based long-
term incentive opportunities that are no less favorable to such Company
Employee or Parent Employee than the annual cash incentive opportunities and
cash-based long-term incentive opportunities provided to the applicable
Company Employee or Parent Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(iii) annual equity-based incentive award opportunity in a mix of equity award
types that is substantially comparable to the mix of equity award types
provided to similarly situated Company Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and with an aggregate opportunity that is no less favorable to
such Company Employee or Parent Employee than the aggregate opportunity for
annual equity-based incentive awards provided to the applicable Company
Employee or Parent Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iv)
other compensation and employee benefits that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the other compensation and benefits provided to such
Company Employee or Parent Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
With respect to Company Employees and Parent Employees who, in each case, are

organization or works council, Parent shall provide compensation, employee

with any employee representative or works council, until such time as those
agreements are terminated, modified or renewed, to the extent required by
applicable Law.

 

(b) _Assumption of Benefit Plans_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume, honor and fulfill all Company Benefit Plans and
Parent Benefit Plans, in each case, in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the date hereof or as subsequently amended as
permitted pursuant to the terms of such Company Benefit Plans or Parent
Benefit Plans, respectively, or this Agreement. Parent and the Company each
acknowledge and agree that a "change of control" (or similar phrase) within
the meaning of any Company Benefit Plan (other than the Company Benefit Plans
set forth in Section 6.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter) or Parent
Benefit Plan containing such a term (or similar phrase) will occur or will be
deemed to occur at the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Service Credit_. For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and
level of benefits under any employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement
or arrangement of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Parent Benefit
Plans and Company Benefit Plans) providing benefits to any Parent Employees or
Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Parent
Employee and Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with Parent or the Company, as applicable, and their respective
Subsidiaries and predecessors before the Effective Time to the extent
such service was recognized by Parent or the Company, as applicable, for
similar purposes prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing
shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan, for any purposes under retiree medical plans or nonqualified
deferred compensation or retirement plans, to any benefit plan that is frozen
or for which participation is limited to a grandfathered

 



81  population or to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Parent Employee or Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a
Parent Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Plan, as applicable, in which such
employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing life insurance, medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Parent Employee or Company Employee, Parent shall, or shall
cause its applicable Subsidiary to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause (A) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless and to the extent the individual, immediately prior
to entry in the New Plans, was subject to such conditions under the
comparable Old Plans, and (B) any eligible expenses incurred by such employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

(d) _Employee Consultation_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in
respect of consultation obligations and similar notice and bargaining
obligations owed to any employees or consultants of Parent or the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries in accordance with all applicable Laws
and works council or other bargaining agreements, if any.

(e) _Written Communications_. The Parties shall provide each other with
copies of any material written communication intended for broad-based and
general distribution to any current or former Company Employees or Parent
Employees if such communications relate to the Transactions and will provide
each other with a reasonable opportunity to review such communications prior
to distribution.

(f) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality of
_Section 9.9_, nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company
Employee or Parent Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent or any of its Affiliates, or shall interfere with or restrict in any
way the rights of Parent or any of its Affiliates, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Company
Employee or Parent Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.11_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to
be an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or Parent
Benefit Plan, or (ii) create any third-party rights in any current or former
service provider or employee of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 

Section 6.12 _Integration Planning_. Subject to _Section 6.13_ and consistent
with the actions set forth in Section 5.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter
and Section 5.2 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, from and after the execution
of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any,
on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_,

 



82  except as may be required by Law (including Antitrust Laws), each Party
hereto shall (and shall cause its Representatives to) use reasonable best
efforts to cooperate in planning the restructuring and integration of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, on the one
hand, with Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, on
the other hand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
_Section 6.12_, the Parties may designate any competitively sensitive
materials provided to the other under this _Section 6.12_ as "outside counsel
only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to outside counsel of the recipient and shall not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient without
the advance written consent of the Party providing such materials or its
counsel.

Section 6.13 _Tax Matters_. From and after the execution of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, except as may be required
by Law, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.1_ or _Section
5.2_, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall, and they shall not
permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action (or knowingly
fail to take any action) that causes, or could reasonably be expected to
cause, the ownership threshold of Section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Code to be
met with respect to the Merger. After the date of this Agreement, Parent shall
provide the Company with a proposed acquisition structure and specific
transaction steps relating to the Merger and the anticipated timing for
completing such transaction steps. Parent shall inform the Company of any
material modifications to and material departures from such acquisition
structure or transaction steps. If the Company disagrees with any
material matters in such proposed acquisition structure or transaction steps
or any such material modification to or material departure from such
acquisition structure or transaction steps, the Company may raise such
objection with Parent not later than one (1) week following receipt by the
Company of such acquisition structure, transaction steps or modification, as
applicable, and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such
objections. In the event the Company does not raise any objections to such
acquisition structure, transaction steps or modification within one (1) week
following receipt thereof, then such acquisition structure, transaction steps
or modification, as applicable, shall be deemed to be consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, including the first sentence of this _Section 6.13_.

Section 6.14 _Security Holder Litigation_. Each Party shall provide the other
Party prompt oral notice of any litigation brought by any shareholder of that
Party, as applicable, against such Party, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any
of their respective directors relating to the Merger, this Agreement or any
of the Transactions. Unless (a) in the case of such litigation with respect to
the Company, the Company Board of Directors has made, or has informed Parent
in writing that it is considering making, a Company Change of Recommendation
or (b) in the case of such litigation with respect to Parent, the Parent Board
of Directors has made, or has informed the Company in writing that it is
considering making, a Parent Change of Recommendation, each Party shall give
the other Party the opportunity to participate (at such other Partys expense)
in the defense or settlement of any such litigation, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without the other Partys prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
except that the other Party shall not be obligated to consent to any
settlement which does not include a full release of such other Party and its
Affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief after the
Effective Time upon Parent or any of its Affiliates. In the event of, and to
the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this _Section
6.14_ and _Section 5.1_,  _Section 5.2_ or _Section 6.2_, the provisions
of this _Section 6.14_ shall prevail.

 



83 Section 6.15 _Parent Share Consolidation_. Subject to Parent Shareholder
Share Consolidation Approval, Parent shall take such actions as are
reasonably necessary to effect the Parent Share Consolidation, effective as of

Section 6.16 _Debt Financing_.

 

(a) Parent will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to cause the Debt Financing to be consummated (including
by taking enforcement action to cause the Lenders to provide the Debt
Financing). Without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not, and shall
cause TIFSA and the Borrower not to, consent or agree to any material
amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any material provision under,
or any replacement of, the Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive
agreements relating to the Debt Financing, or enter into any material
agreement or arrangement with respect to the Debt Financing (including in
respect of any alternative financing) other than definitive agreements
relating to the Debt Financing as contemplated by (and substantially upon the
express terms set forth in) the Debt Commitment Letters, as in effect on the
date hereof; _provided_ that, in any event, Parent shall be permitted to,
and shall be permitted to cause TIFSA or the Borrower to, consent or agree to
any amendment or modification, or any waiver of any provision, under any Debt
Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver solely adds (i)
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof as
parties thereto, or (ii) the Borrower (and correspondingly removes TIFSA) as a
party thereto, and/or in each case to make conforming modifications to any
Debt Commitment Letter in respect of such changes. Any such amendment,
modification or waiver in violation or breach of, or in conflict with, the
terms and conditions set forth in  _Section 6.16(c)_ shall be deemed to be
material for purposes of this _Section 6.16(a)_ and the Companys
withholding, conditioning or delaying of consent with respect thereto shall be
deemed to be reasonable. At the Companys reasonable request from time to
time, Parent shall inform the Company in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing; _provided_ that in no event will
Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to
attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, including
entering into a common defense or common interest, or other similar
agreement, to allow for such disclosure to the maximum extent that does not
result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other
legal privilege).

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in _Section 6.16(c)_, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and its
Subsidiaries such cooperation and assistance as may be reasonably requested by
Parent and its Subsidiaries that is customary in connection with the
arranging, obtaining and syndication of the Debt Financing, including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) make its senior management and advisors
available to participate in a reasonable number of informational meetings,
presentations, and roadshows with proposed lenders, underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents, and in sessions with rating agencies, in each
case, in connection with the Debt Financing, (ii) assist Parent and the
Borrower

 



84  in their preparation of rating agency presentations, lender presentations,
offering memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents required in connection with the Debt Financing and (iii)
participate in drafting sessions with Parent and the Borrower with respect to
the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub
hereby agree that neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall
be required to (i) deliver any financial or other information with respect to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the Debt Financing or
(ii) cause the independent auditors of the Company to cooperate with Parent or
the Borrower in connection with the Debt Financing.

(c) Parent hereby agrees that the definitive agreements relating to the Debt
Financing shall not (i) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
guarantee, grant liens on their respective properties or assets or otherwise
provide, directly or indirectly, credit or collateral support for the Debt
Financing, whether prior to or after the Effective Time, or (ii) contain any
representations, warranties, covenants or events of default, or any other
terms or conditions, in each case that would apply to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, whether prior
to or after the Effective Time (it being understood, for the avoidance of
doubt, that (x) the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions
shall be a condition to the closing of the Debt Financing and (y) certain
representations, warranties, covenants or events of default, or other terms or
conditions may restrict or otherwise affect the Borrowers and its
Subsidiaries dealings with the Company and its Subsidiaries). Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause its financing sources (including the Lead
Arranger under the Debt Commitment Letters) to confirm in writing (which
confirmation may be contained in the definitive agreements relating to the
Debt Financing) that the Debt Financing is being provided to Borrower on the
basis of its properties, assets and credit only.

(d) Parent and the Company agree to cooperate and use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, advisable and proper in connection with the
arrangement, marketing and consummation of the upsizing and amendment of the
current revolving credit facility of Parent and TIFSA (or the replacement
thereof) in connection with the Transactions (the " _Revolver Financing_ "),
including (i) participating in the marketing and syndication efforts related
to the Revolver Financing, (ii) participating in the preparation of rating
agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies, roadshows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and meetings with prospective lenders,
in each case, with respect to the Revolver Financing, (iii) delivering to the
financing sources as promptly as reasonably practicable such financial and
other information customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of
the Revolver Financing and (iv) providing authorization letters to the
financing sources authorizing the distribution of information to prospective
lenders containing a representation to the financing sources that the
information provided for inclusion in the public side versions of such
documents, if any, does not include material non-public information about
Parent or the Company, as applicable, or their respective securities.

 

Section 6.17 _Dividend Coordination_. After the date of this Agreement, each
of Parent and the Company shall coordinate with the other with respect to the
declaration of any dividends in respect of Parent Shares and Company Shares
and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the
intention of the Parties that holders of Company Shares shall not receive
two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect
to their Company Shares and any Parent Shares any such holder receives in
exchange therefor in the Merger.

 



85 Section 6.18 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform when due all of its
obligations under this Agreement.

indicated or the context otherwise requires. All references herein to the
Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context
otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. The

113 Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) The Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
all other prior agreements (except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
deemed amended hereby so that until the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1_, the Parties shall be permitted to take
the actions contemplated by this Agreement) and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

 

(b) Except (i) as provided in _Section 6.4_ (but only following the Effective
Time), (ii) the right of a Party on behalf of its security holders to pursue
damages in the event of another Partys Willful Breach of this Agreement and
(iii) that Financing Sources shall be express third-party beneficiaries of
this _Section 9.9(b)_ and  _Section 8.2(e)_, _Section 9.1(a)_, _Section
9.11_ and _Section 9.12_, no provision of this Agreement (including _Section
8.2(a)_ and including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter) or the Confidentiality Agreement is intended to confer
upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with _Section 9.1_ without notice or liability
to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Merger is
fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

(a) This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute of any kind or nature
(whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) against any Financing Source
that is in any way related to this Agreement or the Merger, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any financing to be
consummated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles
that would result in the application of the Law of any other jurisdiction
(except that matters relating to the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of
Directors shall be subject to the Laws of the State of Wisconsin and matters
relating to the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board of Directors shall be
subject to the laws of Ireland). 

 



114 (b) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal
court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York (or, only if
such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any New York State court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York) in any action or
proceeding between the Parties or their Subsidiaries arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or
proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim brought by the
other Party or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such courts, (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding
in such courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in such courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts
referred to in this _Section 9.11(b)_ in the manner provided for notices in
_Section 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries) and each of the other parties hereto (i) agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or the Merger,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any financing
obtained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or
the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, in any
forum other than exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, located in the Borough of Manhattan, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof).

Section 9.12  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
MERGER, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. NOTWITHSTANDING
ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE COMPANY (ON BEHALF ITSELF AND ITS
SUBSIDIARIES) AND EACH OF THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION RELATED TO ANY FINANCING OBTAINED BY PARENT
OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER OR THE PERFORMANCE
THEREOF OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR ARISING OUT OF
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE

 



115  EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D)
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

Section 9.13  _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of
the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ that either Party may assign
its rights or interests hereunder, in whole or in part, to any of its wholly
owned Subsidiaries, _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve such
Party of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, but
without relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ (other than with
respect to the provisions of this Agreement that survive termination), each
Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy
any breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a
decree or order of specific performance to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

(c) The Parties rights in this _Section 9.14_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.14_ (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). Each Party agrees
that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a breach of this Agreement by
any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy referred to in this
_Section 9.14_, such Party shall not be required to obtain, furnish, post or
provide any bond or other security in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any such remedy.
