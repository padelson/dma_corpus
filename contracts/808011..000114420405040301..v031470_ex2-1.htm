December 16, 2005, is by and among LAS VEGAS RESORTS CORPORATION, a Nevada 
corporation (the " _Parent_ "),  WINNER GROUP LIMITED, a Cayman Islands
exempted company incorporated with  limited liabilities (the " _Company_
"),  and  the Stockholders of the Company signatory hereto (the "
_Stockholders_ ").

 



 

**_BACKGROUND_**

 



 

The  Company has 1,143,000 shares of capital stock (the " _Company  Stock_
")  outstanding, all of which are held by the Stockholders. Each of the
Stockholders  is the record and beneficial owner of the number of shares of
Company Stock  set  forth opposite such Stockholder's name on _Exhibit 
A_.  Each of  the Stockholders has agreed to transfer all of his, her or its
(hereinafter  " _its_ ")  shares  of Company Stock in exchange for the
number of newly issued shares of Common  Stock, par value $0.001 per share,
of the Parent (the " _Parent  Stock_ ")  listed  opposite such
Stockholder's name on _Exhibit  A_ ,  which  in the aggregate amount to a
total of 42,280,840 shares of Parent Stock (the  " _Shares_ ").

 



 

The  exchange of Company Stock for Parent Stock is intended to constitute a 
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(B) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "),  as  amended or such other tax free
reorganization exemptions that may be available  under the Code.

 



 

The  Board  of Directors of the Parent and the Company have determined that
it is desirable  to effect this plan of reorganization and share exchange.

Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. All acts  required to be
taken by the Stockholders to enter into this Agreement and to  carry out the
Transactions have been properly taken. This Agreement constitutes  a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable against  such
Stockholder in accordance with the terms hereof.

intent and the accuracy of the Stockholder's representations as  expressed
herein.

such laws are  applicable to the securities represented by the certificate
so  legended.

The  Company represents and warrants to the Parent that, except as set forth
in  the  Company Disclosure Letter (as defined below) (and regardless of

of this Agreement, from the  Company to the Parent, which Company Disclosure
Letter incorporates by reference  all of the disclosure contained in that
certain Due Diligence Report, dated  November 18, 2005, issued by Grandall
Legal Group (Shenzhen, China) and  delivered to the Parent, relating to the
Company's subsidiaries (the " _Company  Disclosure Letter_ "):

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  3.01. _Organization,  Standing and Power_.  Each of  the Company

possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations 
and  approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its
properties  and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted,
other than  such  franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals the lack of which,  individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be  expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Company, a material adverse  effect on the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations under this  Agreement or on the ability of the
Company to consummate the Transactions (a  " _Company  Material Adverse
Effect_ ").  The  Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to
do business in each  jurisdiction where the nature of its business or its
ownership or leasing of  its  properties make such qualification necessary
except where the failure to so  qualify would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse  Effect. The Company has delivered to the
Parent true and complete copies of  the  memorandum and articles of
association of the Company and such other constituent  instruments of the
Company as may exist, each as amended to the date of this  Agreement (as so
amended, the " _Company  Constituent Instruments_ "),  and  the comparable

SECTION  3.03. _Capital  Structure_.  The  authorized capital stock of the

for issuance or outstanding. Except as specified  in  the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company is the sole record and beneficial  owner of all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of each Company  Subsidiary. All
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company and  each  Company
Subsidiary are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and  nonassessable
and not subject to or issued in violation of any purchase option,  call
option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or 
any  similar right under any provision of the Companies Law of the Cayman
Islands,  the Company Constituent Instruments or any Contract (as defined in

exchangeable for, securities  having the right to vote) on any matters on
which holders of Company Stock  or  the common stock of any Company
Subsidiary may vote (" _Voting  Company Debt_ ").  Except as set forth
above, as of the date of this Agreement, there are not  any  options,
warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom"  stock
rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based performance units, 
commitments, Contracts, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which

bound  (i) obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, deliver
or sell,  or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of
capital stock  or  other equity interests in, or any security convertible or
exercisable for or  exchangeable into any capital stock of or other equity
interest in, the Company  or any Company Subsidiary or any Voting Company
Debt, (ii) obligating the  Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, grant,
extend or enter into any  such  option, warrant, call, right, security,
commitment, Contract, arrangement or  undertaking or (iii) that give any
person the right to receive any economic  benefit or right similar to or
derived from the economic benefits and rights  occurring to holders of the
capital stock of the Company or of any Company  Subsidiary. Except as set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, as of the  date  of this Agreement,

of the Transactions  and  compliance with the terms hereof and thereof will
not, conflict with, or result  in any violation of or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or  both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or  acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
material benefit under, or result  in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company  or any Company Subsidiary under, any
provision of (i) the Company Constituent  Instruments or the comparable
charter or organizational documents of any Company  Subsidiary, (ii) any
material contract, lease, license, indenture, note, bond,  agreement, permit,
concession, franchise or other instrument (a " _Contract_ ")  to  which the

respective properties or assets is bound or (iii) subject to the filings and 
other matters referred to in Section 3.05(b), any material judgment, order 
or  decree (" _Judgment_ ")  or  material Law applicable to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or their  respective properties or assets, other than,
in the case of clauses (ii) and  (iii) above, any such items that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not  had  and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse  Effect.

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Except  as  set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter and except for
required filings  with  the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
")  and  applicable "Blue Sky" or state securities commissions, no

the  Transactions.

(a) Each  of  the Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed, or
has caused to  be  timely filed on its behalf, all Tax Returns required to
be filed by it, and  all  such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate,
except to the extent any  failure to file or any inaccuracies in any filed
Tax Returns, individually  or in  the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a  Company Material Adverse Effect. All Taxes
shown to be due on such Tax Returns,  or otherwise owed, have been timely
paid, except to the extent that any failure  to pay, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably  be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The  Company Financial Statements (as defined in Section 3.15) reflect an
adequate  reserve for all Taxes payable by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (in  addition to any reserve for deferred Taxes to reflect
timing differences between  book and Tax items) for all Taxable periods and
portions thereof through the  date of such financial statements. No
deficiency with respect to any Taxes  has  been proposed, asserted or
assessed against the Company or any Company  Subsidiary, and no requests for
waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes  are  pending, except to the
extent any such deficiency or request for waiver,  individually or in the

Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) For  purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" _Taxes_ "  includes all forms of taxation, whenever created or imposed, and

vacation, severance,  disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or
other plan, arrangement  or understanding (whether or not legally binding)
providing benefits to any  current or former employee, officer or director of
the Company or any Company  Subsidiary (collectively, " _Company  Benefit

Company Subsidiary, nor  does  the Company or any Company Subsidiary have
any general severance plan or  policy.

 



 

(b) Since  September 30, 2005, there has not been any adoption or amendment
in any material  respect by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any
Company Benefit  Plan.

 



 

SECTION  3.08. _Litigation_.  There  are no suits, actions or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the  Company, threatened against the Company
or any Company Subsidiary that,  individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Company  Material Adverse Effect, nor is
there any Judgment outstanding against the  Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

 



 

SECTION  3.09. _Compliance  with Applicable Laws_.  The  Company and the
Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable  Laws,  including
those relating to occupational health and safety and the environment,  except
for instances of noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate,  have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material 
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the 
Company has not received any written communication during the past two years 
from a Governmental Entity that alleges that the Company is not in
compliance  in  any material respect with any applicable Law. This Section
3.09 does not relate  to matters with respect to Taxes, which are the subject
of Section  3.06.

 



 

SECTION  3.10. _Brokers;  Schedule of Fees and Expenses_.  No  broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to  any 
broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission
in  connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf  of  the Company.

 



 

SECTION  3.11. _Contracts_.  Except  as disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no Contracts that  are  material to the business,
properties, assets, condition (financial or  otherwise), results of
operations or prospects of the Company and its  subsidiaries taken as a
whole. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary  is  in violation of
or in default under (nor does there exist any condition which  upon the
passage of time or the giving of notice would cause such a violation  of  or
default under) any Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any 
of  its properties or assets is bound, except for violations or defaults that
would  not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in  a  Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  3.12. _Title  to Properties_.  Except  as set forth in the
Disclosure Letter, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries  do not own any
real property. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries  has
sufficient title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all of its properties 
and assets used in the conduct of its businesses. All such assets and 
properties, other than assets and properties in which the Company or any of 
the  Company Subsidiaries has leasehold interests, are free and clear of all
Liens  other than those set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter and except
for  Liens  that, in the aggregate, do not and will not materially interfere
with the  ability of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to conduct
business as  currently conducted.

 



 

SECTION  3.13. _Intellectual  Property_.  The  Company and the Company
Subsidiaries own, or are validly licensed or otherwise  have the right to
use, all patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights,  trade names,
trade name rights, service marks, service mark rights, copyrights  and other
proprietary intellectual property rights and computer programs 
(collectively, " _Intellectual  Property Rights_ ")  which  are material to
the conduct of the business of the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. Except for those certain licenses by Jianquan  Li  and
Nianfu Huo relating to certain patent and patent applications, copies of 
which have been delivered to the Parent, the Company Disclosure Letter sets 
forth a description of all Intellectual Property Rights which are material 
to  the conduct of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
taken  as  a whole. There are no claims pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company,  threatened that the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is
infringing  or  otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any person with
regard to any  Intellectual Property Right. To the knowledge of the Company,
no person is  infringing the rights of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries with  respect to any Intellectual Property Right.

 



 

SECTION  3.14. _Labor  Matters_.  There  are no collective bargaining or
other labor union agreements to which the  Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them  is  bound.

 



 

SECTION  3.15. _Financial  Statements_.  The  Company has delivered to the
Parent its audited consolidated financial  statements for the fiscal years
ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 (collectively,  the " _Company  Financial
Statements_ ").  The  Company Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis throughout the  periods indicated. The Company Financial
Statements fairly present in all  material respects the financial condition
and operating results of the Company,  as of the dates, and for the periods,
indicated therein. The Company does not  have any material liabilities or
obligations, contingent or otherwise, other  than (i) liabilities incurred in
the ordinary course of business subsequent  to September 30, 2005, and (ii)
obligations under contracts and commitments  incurred in the ordinary course
of business and not required under generally  accepted accounting principles
to be reflected in the Company Financial  Statements, which, in both cases,
individually and in the aggregate would not  be  reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

SECTION  3.16. _Insurance_.  The  Company and its subsidiaries are insured
by insurers of recognized financial  responsibility against such losses and
risks and in such amounts as are prudent  and customary in the businesses in
which the Company and its subsidiaries are  engaged and in the geographic
areas where they engage in such businesses. The  Company has no reason to
believe that it will not be able to renew its and  its  subsidiaries'
existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or  to obtain
similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue  its
business on terms consistent with market for the Company's and such 
subsidiaries' respective lines of business.

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  3.17. _Transactions  With Affiliates and Employees_.  Except  as
set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter and Company Financial Statements, 
none of the officers or directors of the Company and, to the knowledge of
the  Company, none of the employees of the Company is presently a party to
any  transaction with the Company or any subsidiary (other than for services
as  employees, officers and directors), including any contract, agreement or
other  arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or by,
providing for  rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise
requiring payments  to or from any officer, director or such employee or, to
the knowledge of the  Company, any entity in which any officer, director, or
any such employee has  a  substantial interest or is an officer, director,
trustee or  partner.

 



 

SECTION  3.18. _Internal  Accounting Controls_.  The  Company and its
subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls  sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed  in 
accordance with management\'s general or specific authorizations, (ii) 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and 
to  maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only
in  accordance with management\'s general or specific authorization, and (iv)
the  recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets
at  reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any  differences. The Company has established disclosure controls and
procedures  for  the Company and designed such disclosure controls and
procedures to ensure  that  material information relating to the Company,
including its subsidiaries, is  made known to the officers by others within
those entities. The Company\'s  officers have evaluated the effectiveness of
the Company\'s controls and  procedures. Since September 30, 2005, there have
been no significant changes  in  the Company's internal controls or, to the
Company\'s knowledge, in other factors  that could significantly affect the
Company\'s internal controls.

 



 

SECTION  3.19. _Solvency_.  Based  on the financial condition of the
Company as of the closing date (and assuming  that the closing shall have
occurred), (i) the Company\'s fair saleable value  of  its assets exceeds
the amount that will be required to be paid on or in respect  of the
Company\'s existing debts and other liabilities (including known  contingent
liabilities) as they mature, (ii) the Company\'s assets do not  constitute
unreasonably small capital to carry on its business for the current  fiscal
year as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted including its  capital
needs taking into account the particular capital requirements of the 
business conducted by the Company, and projected capital requirements and 
capital availability thereof, and (iii) the current cash flow of the
Company,  together with the proceeds the Company would receive, were it to
liquidate  all  of its assets, after taking into account all anticipated
uses of the cash,  would  be sufficient to pay all amounts on or in respect
of its debt when such amounts  are required to be paid. The Company does not
intend to incur debts beyond  its  ability to pay such debts as they mature
(taking into account the timing and  amounts of cash to be payable on or in
respect of its debt).

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  3.20. _Application  of Takeover Protections_.  The  Company has
taken all necessary action, if any, in order to render inapplicable  any
control share acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including 
any  distribution under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-takeover
provision  under the Company\'s charter documents or the laws of its state of
incorporation  that is or could become applicable to the Stockholders as a
result of the  Stockholders and the Company fulfilling their obligations or
exercising their  rights under this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the issuance of  the  Shares and the Stockholders\' ownership of the Shares.

 



 

SECTION  3.21. _No  Additional Agreements_.  The  Company does not have
any agreement or understanding with any Stockholders  with  respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than as  specified in this
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION  3.22. _Investment  Company_.  The  Company is not, and is not an
affiliate of, and immediately following the  Closing will not have become, an
"investment company" within the meaning of the  Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended.

 



 

SECTION  3.23. _Disclosure_.  The  Company confirms that neither it nor any
person acting on its behalf has  provided any Stockholder or its respective
agents or counsel with any  information that the Company believes constitutes
material, non-public  information except insofar as the existence and terms
of the proposed  transactions hereunder may constitute such information and 
except for information that will be disclosed by the Parent under a current 
report on Form 8-K filed on or one business day after the Closing.  The 
Company understands and confirms that the Stockholders will rely on the 
foregoing representations and covenants in effecting transactions in

ARTICLE  IV

 



 

_Representations  and Warranties of the Parent_

 



 

The  Parent represents and warrants as follows to each of the Stockholders
and the  Company that, except as set forth in the reports, schedules, forms,
statements  and other documents filed by Parent with the SEC and publicly
available prior  to  the date of the Agreement (the " _Filed  Parent SEC
Documents_ ")  or in  the letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement,
from Parent to the Company  and the Stockholders (the " _Parent  Disclosure
Letter_ "):

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  4.01. _Organization,  Standing and Power_.  Parent  is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of  the 
State of Nevada and has full corporate power and authority and possesses all 
governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals 
necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets  and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than
such  franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of
which,  individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be  expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent, a
material adverse effect  on the ability of Parent to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or  on  the ability of Parent to consummate the
Transactions (a " _Parent  Material Adverse Effect_ ").  Parent is duly
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature  of  its
business or their ownership or leasing of its properties make such 
qualification necessary and where the failure to so qualify would reasonably 
be  expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has delivered
to  the  Company true and complete copies of the articles of incorporation
of Parent,  as  amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the "
_Parent  Charter_ "),  and  the Bylaws of Parent, as amended to the date of
this Agreement (as so amended,  the " _Parent  Bylaws_ "). 

 



 

SECTION  4.02. _Subsidiaries;  Equity Interests_.  Parent  does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest,  partnership
interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest in any  person.

 



 

SECTION  4.03. _Capital  Structure_.  The  authorized capital stock of
Parent consists of 495,000,000 shares of Parent  Common Stock, par value
$0.001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred  stock, par value $0.001
per share. As of the date hereof (i) 1,562,271 shares  of  Parent Common
Stock are issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of preferred  stock are
outstanding and (iii) no shares of Parent Common Stock or preferred  stock
are held by Parent in its treasury. Except as set forth above, no shares  of
capital stock or other voting securities of Parent were issued, reserved 
for  issuance or outstanding. All outstanding shares of the capital stock of
Parent  are, and all such shares that may be issued prior to the date hereof
will be  when issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable  and  not subject to or issued in violation of any purchase
option, call option,  right  of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any similar right  under any provision of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Nevada,  the  Parent Charter, the Parent
Bylaws or any Contract to which Parent is a party  or  otherwise bound.
1,452,014 of the outstanding 1,562,271 shares of the Parent's  common stock
are restricted stock held by affiliates of the Parent and  constitute control
stock. The remaining 110,257 shares of the Parent's  outstanding common stock
are free-trading shares and may be resold without  restriction. There are not
any bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness  of  Parent having the
right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,  securities having
the right to vote) on any matters on which holders of Parent  Common Stock
may vote (" _Voting  Parent Debt_ ").  Except as set forth above, as of the
date of this Agreement, there are not  any  options, warrants, rights,
convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom"  stock rights, stock
appreciation rights, stock-based performance units,  commitments, Contracts,
arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which Parent  is a party or by
which any of them is bound (i) obligating Parent to issue,  deliver or sell,
or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares  of  capital
stock or other equity interests in, or any security convertible or 
exercisable for or exchangeable into any capital stock of or other equity 
interest in, Parent or any Voting Parent Debt, (ii) obligating Parent to
issue,  grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right,
security,  commitment, Contract, arrangement or undertaking or (iii) that
give any person  the right to receive any economic benefit or right similar
to or derived from  the economic benefits and rights occurring to holders of
the capital stock  of  the Parent. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are not any outstanding  contractual obligations of Parent to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire  any  shares of capital stock of Parent. The
Parent is not a party to any agreement  granting any securityholder of the
Parent the right to cause the Parent to  register shares of the capital stock
or other securities of the Parent held  by  such securityholder under the
Securities Act. The stockholder list provided  to  the Company is a current
shareholder list generated by its stock transfer agent,  and such list
accurately reflects all of the issued and outstanding shares  of  the
Parent's Common Stock.

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  4.04. _Authority;  Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_.  The 
execution and delivery by the Parent of this Agreement and the consummation 
by  the Parent of the Transactions have been duly authorized and approved by
the  Board of Directors of the Parent and no other corporate proceedings on
the  part  of the Parent are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the
Transactions.  This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Parent,  enforceable against the Parent in accordance with
the terms hereof.

 



 

SECTION  4.05. _No  Conflicts; Consents_. 

 



 

(a) Except  as  set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter, the execution and
delivery by Parent  of this Agreement, does not, and the consummation of
Transactions and compliance  with the terms hereof and thereof will not,
conflict with, or result in any  violation of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both)  under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration  of  any obligation or to loss of
a material benefit under, or to increased,  additional, accelerated or
guaranteed rights or entitlements of any person  under, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or  assets of Parent under,
any provision of (i) Parent Charter or Parent Bylaws,  (ii) any material
Contract to which Parent is a party or by which any of its  properties or
assets is bound or (iii) subject to the filings and other matters  referred
to in Section 4.05(b), any material Judgment or material Law applicable  to
Parent or its properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) 
and (iii) above, any such items that, individually or in the aggregate, have 
not  had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse  Effect.

 



 

(b) No  Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or permit
from, any  Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with
respect to  Parent in connection with the execution, delivery and performance
of this  Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, other than the
(A) filing  with the SEC of 14f-1 Notice and (B) filing with the SEC of
reports under  Sections 13 and 16 of the Exchange Act, and (C) filings under
state "blue sky"  laws, as may be required in connection with this Agreement
and the  Transactions.

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  4.06. _SEC  Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_. 

 



 

(a) Parent  has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents required  to be filed by Parent with the SEC since July 31, 2003,
pursuant to Sections  13(a), 14 (a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act (the "
_Parent  SEC Documents_ ").

 



 

(b) As  of its  respective filing date, each Parent SEC Document complied in
all material  respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations  of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
Parent SEC Document, and  did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a  material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the  statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made,  not misleading. Except to the
extent that information contained in any Parent  SEC Document has been
revised or superseded by a later filed Parent SEC  Document, none of the
Parent SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of  a  material fact or
omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein  or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated  financial statements
of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents comply  as to  form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the  published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been  prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements,  as
permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent 
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes 
thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of Parent
and  its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated  results of their operations and cash flows for the periods
shown (subject,  in  the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end
audit  adjustments).

 



 

(c) Except  as  set forth in the Filed Parent SEC Documents, Parent has no
liabilities or  obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise)  required by GAAP to be set forth on a balance sheet
of Parent or in the notes  thereto. The Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth
all financial and contractual  obligations and liabilities (including any
obligations to issue capital stock  or  other securities of the parent) due
after the date hereof. As of the date hereof  the Parent has total
liabilities of less than $5,000, all of which liabilities  shall be paid off
at or prior to the Closing and shall in no event remain  liabilities of the
Parent, the Company or the Stockholders following the  Closing.

 



 

SECTION  4.07. _Information  Supplied_.  None of  the information supplied
or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or  incorporation by reference in
the 14f-1 Notice will, at the date it is first  mailed to the Parent's
stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material  fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or  necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances  under which
they are made, not misleading.

 



 

SECTION  4.08. _Absence  of Certain Changes or Events_.  Except  as

Letter, from the date of the most recent audited financial statements
included  in the Filed Parent SEC Documents to the date of this Agreement,

such period  there  has not been:

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

(a) any  change in the assets, liabilities, financial condition or operating
results  of  the Parent from that reflected in the Parent SEC Documents,
except changes  in  the ordinary course of business that have not caused, in
the aggregate, a Parent  Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(b) any  damage, destruction or loss, whether or not covered by insurance,
that would  have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(c) any  waiver or compromise by the Parent of a valuable right or of a
material debt  owed to it;

 



 

(d) any  satisfaction or discharge of any lien, claim, or encumbrance or
payment of  any  obligation by the Parent, except in the ordinary course of
business and the  satisfaction or discharge of which would not have a Parent
Material Adverse  Effect;

 



 

(e) any  material change to a material Contract by which the Parent or any of
its assets  is bound or subject;

 



 

(f) any  material change in any compensation arrangement or agreement with
any employee,  officer, director or stockholder;

 



 

(g) any  resignation or termination of employment of any officer of the
Parent; 

 



 

(h) any  mortgage, pledge, transfer of a security interest in, or lien,
created by the  Parent, with respect to any of its material properties or
assets, except liens  for taxes not yet due or payable and liens that arise
in the ordinary course  of  business and do not materially impair the
Parent's ownership or use of such  property or assets;

 



 

(i) any  loans  or guarantees made by the Parent to or for the benefit of
its employees,  officers or directors, or any members of their immediate

(j) any  declaration, setting aside or payment or other distribution in
respect of any  of  the Parent's capital stock, or any direct or indirect

(k) any  alteration of the Parent's method of accounting or the identity of
its auditors;  or

 



 

(l) any  issuance of equity securities to any officer, director or affiliate,
except  pursuant to existing Parent stock option plans; or

 



 

(m) any  arrangement or commitment by the Parent to do any of the things
described in  this Section 4.08.

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  4.09. _Taxes_. 

 



 

(a) Parent  has timely filed, or has caused to be timely filed on its behalf,
all Tax  Returns required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are
true, complete  and accurate, except to the extent any failure to file or any
inaccuracies  in  any filed Tax Returns, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would  not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. All Taxes  shown to be due on such Tax Returns, or otherwise
owed, has been timely paid,  except to the extent that any failure to pay,
individually or in the aggregate,  has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material  Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The  most  recent financial statements contained in the Filed Parent SEC
Documents reflect  an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by Parent (in
addition to any reserve  for deferred Taxes to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax items)  for  all Taxable periods and portions thereof
through the date of such financial  statements. No deficiency with respect to
any Taxes has been proposed, asserted  or assessed against Parent, and no
requests for waivers of the time to assess  any such Taxes are pending,
except to the extent any such deficiency or request  for waiver, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not  reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) There  are  no Liens for Taxes (other than for current Taxes not yet due
and payable) on  the  assets of Parent. Parent is not bound by any agreement
with respect to  Taxes.

 



 

SECTION  4.10. _Absence  of Changes in Benefit Plans_.  From  the date of
the most recent audited financial statements included in the Filed  Parent
SEC Documents to the date of this Agreement, there has not been any  adoption
or amendment in any material respect by Parent of any collective  bargaining
agreement or any bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred  compensation,
incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock  option,
phantom stock, retirement, vacation, severance, disability, death  benefit,
hospitalization, medical or other plan, arrangement or understanding 
(whether or not legally binding) providing benefits to any current or former

Plans_ ").  As of  the date of this Agreement there are not any employment,
consulting,  indemnification, severance or termination agreements or
arrangements between  the  Parent and any current or former employee,
officer or director of the Parent,  nor does the Parent have any general
severance plan or policy.

 



 

SECTION  4.11. _ERISA  Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments_.  The 
Parent does not, and since its inception never has, maintained, or
contributed  to any "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section

of ERISA) or any  other Parent Benefit Plan for the benefit of any current or
former employees,  consultants, officers or directors of Parent.

 



 

SECTION  4.12. _Litigation_.  Except  as disclosed in the Filed Parent SEC
Documents or in the Parent Disclosure  Letter, there is no suit, action or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge  of  Parent, threatened against or

in the Filed Parent SEC Documents or in the Parent Disclosure  Letter, Parent
is in compliance with all applicable Laws, including those  relating to
occupational health and safety and the environment, except for  instances of
noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate, have not  had  and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 
Except as set forth in the Filed Parent SEC Documents or in the Parent 
Disclosure Letter, Parent has not received any written communication during 
the  past two years from a Governmental Entity that alleges that Parent is
not in  compliance in any material respect with any applicable Law. This
Section 4.13  does not relate to matters with respect to Taxes, which are the
subject of  Section 4.09.

 



 

SECTION  4.14. _Contracts_.  Except  as disclosed in the Parent Filed SEC
Documents, there are no Contracts that  are  material to the business,
properties, assets, condition (financial or  otherwise), results of
operations or prospects of the Parent taken as a whole.  Parent is not in

upon the passage of time or the giving of notice would cause  such a
violation of or default under) any Contract to which it is a party or  by 
which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except for violations 
or  defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be  expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

SECTION  4.15. _Title  to Properties_.  Parent  has good title to, or
valid leasehold interests in, all of its properties and  assets used in the
conduct of its businesses. All such assets and properties,  other than assets
and properties in which the Parent has leasehold interests,  are free and
clear of all Liens other than those set forth in the Parent  Disclosure
Letter and except for Liens that, in the aggregate, do not and will  not
materially interfere with the ability of the Parent to conduct business  as 
currently conducted. Parent has complied in all material respects with the 
terms  of all material leases to which it is a party and under which it is
in  occupancy, and all such leases are in full force and effect. Parent
enjoys  peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such material leases.

 



 

SECTION  4.16. _Intellectual  Property_.  Parent  owns, or is validly
licensed or otherwise has the right to use, all Intellectual  Property Rights
which are material to the conduct of the business of the Parent  taken as a
whole. The Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a description of  all 
Intellectual Property Rights which are material to the conduct of the
business  of the Parent taken as a whole. Except as set forth in the Parent
Disclosure  Letter no claims are pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent,
threatened  that  the Parent is infringing or otherwise adversely affecting

the knowledge of  the  Parent, no person is infringing the rights of the
Parent with respect to any  Intellectual Property Right.

 



 

SECTION  4.17. _Labor  Matters_.  There  are no collective bargaining or
other labor union agreements to which the Parent  is a party or by which it
is bound.

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  4.18. _Market  Makers_.  The  Parent has at least two market
makers for its common shares and such market  makers have obtained all
permits and made all filings necessary in order for  such market makers to
continue as market makers of the Parent.

 



 

SECTION  4.19. _Transactions  With Affiliates and Employees_.  Except  as
set forth in the Filed Parent SEC Documents and Parent Disclosure Letter, 
none of the officers or directors of the Parent and, to the knowledge of the 
Parent, none of the employees of the Parent is presently a party to any 
transaction with the Parent or any subsidiary (other than for services as 
employees, officers and directors), including any contract, agreement or
other  arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or by,
providing for  rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise
requiring payments  to or from any officer, director or such employee or, to
the knowledge of the  Parent, any entity in which any officer, director, or
any such employee has  a  substantial interest or is an officer, director,
trustee or  partner.

 



 

SECTION  4.20. _Internal  Accounting Controls_.  The  Parent maintains a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide  reasonable
assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with 
management\'s general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are
recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with  generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain
asset accountability,  (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with management\'s general  or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets  is  compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action  is taken with respect to any
differences. The Parent has established disclosure  controls and procedures
for the Parent and designed such disclosure controls  and  procedures to
ensure that material information relating to the Parent is made  known to the
officers by others within those entities. The Parent\'s officers  have
evaluated the effectiveness of the Parent\'s controls and procedures. Since 
July 31, 2005, there have been no significant changes in the Parent's
internal  controls or, to the Parent\'s knowledge, in other factors that
could  significantly affect the Parent\'s internal controls.

 



 

SECTION  4.21. _Solvency_.  Based  on the financial condition of the
Parent  as of  the closing date (and assuming that the closing shall have
occurred), (i) the  Parent\'s fair saleable value of its assets exceeds the
amount that will be  required to be paid on or in respect of the Parent\'s
existing debts and other  liabilities (including known contingent
liabilities) as they mature, (ii) the  Parent\'s assets do not constitute
unreasonably small capital to carry on its  business for the current fiscal
year as now conducted and as proposed to be  conducted including its capital
needs taking into account the particular capital  requirements of the
business conducted by the Parent, and projected capital  requirements and
capital availability thereof, and (iii) the current cash flow  of the Parent,
together with the proceeds the Parent would receive, were it  to  liquidate
all of its assets, after taking into account all anticipated uses  of  the
cash, would be sufficient to pay all amounts on or in respect of its debt 
when such amounts are required to be paid. The Parent does not intend to
incur  debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature (taking into
account  the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of
its  debt).

 



 

SECTION  4.22. _Application  of Takeover Protections_.  The  Parent has
taken all necessary action, if any, in order to render inapplicable  any
control share acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including 
any  distribution under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-takeover
provision  under the Parent\'s charter documents or the laws of its state of
incorporation  that is or could become applicable to the Stockholders as a
result of the  Stockholders and the Parent fulfilling their obligations or
exercising their  rights under this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the issuance of  the  Shares and the Stockholders\' ownership of the Shares.

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  4.23. _No  Additional Agreements_.  The  Parent does not have any
agreement or understanding with the Stockholders with  respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than as  specified in this
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION  4.24. _Investment  Company_.  The  Parent is not, and is not an
affiliate of, and immediately following the Closing  will not have become, an
"investment company" within the meaning of the  Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended.

 



 

SECTION  4.25. _Disclosure_.  The  Parent confirms that neither it nor any
person acting on its behalf has provided  any Stockholder or its respective
agents or counsel with any information that  the Parent believes constitutes
material, non-public information except insofar  as the existence and terms
of the proposed transactions hereunder may constitute  such information and
except for information that will be disclosed by the Parent  under a current
report on Form 8-K filed on or one business day after the  Closing. The
Parent understands and confirms that the Stockholders will rely  on  the
foregoing representations and covenants in effecting transactions in 
securities of the Parent. All disclosure provided to the Stockholders
regarding  the Parent, its business and the transactions contemplated hereby,
furnished  by  or on behalf of the Parent (including the Parent's
representations and  warranties set forth in this Agreement) are true and
correct and do not contain  any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact  necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 



 

SECTION  4.26. _Certain  Registration Matters_.  Except  as specified in
the Parent Disclosure Letter and Filed Parent SEC Documents  and  except for
registration rights granted to affiliates of Timothy Halter, Glenn  Little
and Zhihao Zhang and Registration rights that will be granted by the  Parent
to about 60 investors who the Parent anticipates will be investing in  a 
private placement under Registration S of the Securities Act relating to an 
approximately $1,600,000 capital raise, the Parent has not granted or agreed 
to  grant to any person any rights (including "piggy-back" registration
rights)  to  have any securities of the Parent registered with the SEC or
any other  governmental authority that have not been satisfied.

 



 

SECTION  4.27. _Listing  and Maintenance Requirements_.  The  Parent is,
and has no reason to believe that it will not in the foreseeable  future
continue to be, in compliance with the listing and maintenance  requirements

SECTION  8.03. _Registration  Provisions_.  If for  any reason the SEC
does not permit all of the Shares to be included in the  Registration
Statement filed pursuant to Section 7.08, or for any other reason  any

Stockholder shall be  responsible in any way for the performance of the
obligations of any other  Stockholder under this Agreement. The decision of
each Stockholder to acquire  Shares pursuant to this Agreement has been made
by such Stockholder  independently of any other Stockholder. Nothing
contained herein, and no action  taken by any Stockholder pursuant thereto,
shall be deemed to constitute the  Stockholders as a partnership, an
association, a joint venture or any other  kind  of entity, or create a
presumption that the Stockholders are in any way acting  in concert or as a
group with respect to such obligations or the transactions  contemplated
herein. Each Stockholders acknowledges that no other Stockholder  has acted
as agent for such Stockholder in connection with making its investment 
hereunder and that no Stockholder will be acting as agent of such
Stockholder  in  connection with monitoring its investment in the Shares or
enforcing its rights  under this Agreement. Each Stockholder shall be
entitled to independently  protect and enforce its rights, including without
limitation the rights arising  out of this Agreement, and it shall not be

any proceeding for such purpose. Each  of  the Company and Parent
acknowledge that each of the Stockholders has been  provided with this same
Agreement for the purpose of closing a transaction  with  multiple
Stockholders and not because it was required or requested to do so  by  any
Stockholder.

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  8.07. _Limitation  of Liability_.  Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, each of the Parent and the  Company acknowledge and agree
that the liability of a Stockholder arising  directly or indirectly, under
any transaction document of any and every nature  whatsoever shall be
satisfied solely out of the assets of such Stockholder,  and  that no
trustee, officer, other investment vehicle or any other affiliate of  such
Stockholder or any investor, shareholder or holder of shares of beneficial 
interest of such Stockholder shall be personally liable for any liabilities 
of  such Stockholder.

 



 

SECTION  8.08. _Interpretation;  Disclosure Letters_.  When a  reference
is made in this Agreement to a Section, such reference shall be to  a 
Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the

Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable  of  being enforced by any rule
or Law, or public policy, all other conditions and  provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect  so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions contemplated  hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon  such 
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable  of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify  this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely  as  possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
Transactions contemplated  hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

rights, interests or obligations under this  Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or  otherwise by any of the parties
