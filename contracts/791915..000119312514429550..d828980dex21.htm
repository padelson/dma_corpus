of Cypress (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Spansion Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Spansion_ "). All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have
the respective meanings ascribed thereto in _Annex A_.

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, each of the respective Boards of Directors of Cypress, Merger Sub
and Spansion has approved the Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and deems it advisable and in the best interest of its stockholders to
enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will be merged with
and into Spansion (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Spansion
will continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger and as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Cypress and each share of Spansion Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined herein) will be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth herein,
all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this
Agreement will be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Cypress and Merger Sub to
enter into this Agreement, each of the officers and directors of Spansion, in
their respective capacities as stockholders of Spansion, has entered into
support agreements with Cypress substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (each, a " _Spansion Support Agreement_ " and collectively, the "
_Spansion Support Agreements_ ").

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Spansion to enter into this
Agreement, each of the officers and directors of Cypress, in their respective
capacities as stockholders of Cypress, has entered into support agreements
with Spansion substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
B_ (each, a " _Cypress Support Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Cypress
Support Agreements_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Cypress, Merger Sub and Spansion hereby agree as follows:

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, on the Closing Date,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Spansion, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and Spansion shall continue as
the surviving corporation of the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Cypress. Spansion, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes
referred to herein as the " _Surviving_

 



1   __ _Corporation_." Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Cypress, Merger Sub and Spansion shall
cause the Merger to be consummated under the DGCL by filing a certificate of
merger in customary form and substance (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of
State_ ") in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The time
of such filing and acceptance by the Delaware Secretary of State, or such
later time as may be agreed in writing by Cypress and Spansion and specified
in the Certificate of Merger, is referred to herein as the " _Effective
Time_."

1.2 _The Surviving Corporation of the Merger_.

 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation._

 

(i) _Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to the terms of _Section 7.8(b)_,
at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Spansion shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to read identically to the Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and such amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation shall become
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and such
Certificate of Incorporation; _provided, however_ , that at the Effective
Time the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Spansion."

 

(ii) _Bylaws_. Subject to the terms of _Section 7.8(b)_, at the Effective
Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and
such Bylaws.

(b) _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(i) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

(ii) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

 

1.3 _General Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Spansion and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of Spansion and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4  _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Merging Corporations._

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.
Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of
Merger Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

 



2 (b) _Capital Stock of Spansion_.

 

(i) _Generally_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Cypress, Merger Sub, Spansion, or the holders of any
of the following securities, other than as otherwise set forth in this
_Section 1.4(b)_, each share of Spansion Common Stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive 2.457 shares of Cypress
Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") and the cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to this _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ (the " _Common
Stock Consideration_ ") upon the surrender of the certificate, if any,
representing such share of Spansion Common Stock in the manner provided in 
_Section 2.3(c)_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided
in _Section 2.3(e)_); _provided, however_ , that (x) the Exchange Ratio
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Cypress Common Stock or Spansion
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other
like change with respect to Cypress Common Stock or Spansion Common Stock
having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time, and (y) notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set
forth herein, no fraction of a share of Cypress Common Stock will be issued by
virtue of the Merger, and in lieu thereof, each holder of record of shares of
Spansion Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
share of Cypress Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Cypress Common Stock that otherwise would
be received by such holder of record) shall, upon the surrender of the
certificate, if any, representing such share of Spansion Common Stock in the
manner provided in _Section 2.3(c)_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required)
in the manner provided in _Section 2.3(e)_), receive an amount of cash
(rounded down to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying such fraction by the Closing Average. From and
after the Effective Time, all shares of Spansion Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to
exist, and each holder of shares of Spansion Common Stock shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of
Cypress Common Stock issuable in respect thereof pursuant to this _Section
1.4(b)(i)_, cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this  _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ and any dividends or other
distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_. All
shares of Cypress Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
shares of Spansion Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to this _Section
1.4(b)(i)_ in lieu of a fractional share of Cypress Common Stock and any
dividends or other distributions paid in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
2.3(d)_) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Spansion Common Stock, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Spansion Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
certificate representing shares of Spansion Common Stock is presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, then such certificate shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Common Stock Consideration in accordance with this
_Section 1.4(b)_, any cash payable in respect thereof pursuant to this 
_Section 1.4(b)(i)_ in lieu of a fractional share of Cypress Common Stock and
any dividends or other distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.3(d)_.

 

(ii) _Owned Shares of Spansion Common Stock_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Cypress, Merger Sub, Spansion, or the
holders of any of the following securities, each share of Spansion Common
Stock that is owned by Cypress, Merger Sub or Spansion, or by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Cypress, Merger Sub or Spansion, in each
case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

 



3 (iii) _Restricted Shares of Spansion Common Stock_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth herein, if any shares of Spansion Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or subject to
a repurchase option or obligation, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
Spansion or under which Spansion has any rights (the " _Spansion Restricted
Stock_ "), then the Common Stock Consideration payable in exchange for such
Spansion Restricted Stock also shall be unvested and subject to the same
repurchase option or obligation, risk of forfeiture or other condition and
need not be paid until such time as such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture
or other condition lapses or otherwise terminates, and the certificates
representing such shares of Spansion Restricted Stock may accordingly be
marked with appropriate legends. Prior to the Effective Time, Spansion shall
take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after
the Effective Time, Cypress is entitled to exercise any such repurchase
option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement.

 

(c) _Stock Awards of Spansion_.

 

(i) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Spansion Stock Award that is
a stock option to purchase shares of Spansion Common Stock (each a "
_Spansion Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable (each, an " _Assumed
Option_ "), shall be assumed by Cypress and converted into an option to
acquire that number of shares of Cypress Common Stock equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Spansion Common Stock
subject to such Spansion Stock Option by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down
to the nearest whole share of Cypress Common Stock. Each Assumed Option shall
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including as to vesting
and exercisability) as were applicable under the respective Spansion Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each Assumed
Option shall have an exercise price per share equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (x) the per share exercise price of Spansion Common Stock subject
to such Assumed Option by (y) the Exchange Ratio (which price per share shall
be rounded up to the nearest whole cent). It is the intention of the parties
that each Assumed Option that qualified as a United States-based incentive
stock option (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall continue to so
qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Stock Option is subject to the Legal
Requirements of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and Cypress determines (in good faith
and upon advice from Cypresss legal counsel) the Stock Option may not be
converted into an Assumed Option under a Legal Requirement of the relevant
non-U.S. jurisdiction (including without limitation by reason of a failure to
obtain any required regulatory consents or approvals after making reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain such consents or approvals) (such Stock Options,
the " _Unassumed Non-U.S. Options_ "), Cypress shall, to ensure compliance
with applicable Legal Requirements: (A) require that outstanding Unassumed
Non-U.S. Options be accelerated and exercised only by a cashless exercise
pursuant to which employees will authorize a broker to sell all shares that
they are entitled to at exercise immediately upon exercise and receive the
difference between the fair market value of the shares at exercise and the
exercise price in cash; (B) provide for conversion of the Unassumed Non-U.S.
Options into the right to receive, as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of
the Closing Average over the applicable exercise price of such Unassumed
Non-U.S. Option by (y) the number of Spansion shares subject to such
Unassumed Non-U.S. Option, less all applicable deductions and withholdings
required by applicable Legal Requirements to be withheld in respect of such
payment; or (C) provide for such other treatment that is in compliance with
applicable Legal Requirements and reasonably agreed upon by Cypress and
Spansion at least twenty (20) days prior to the Effective Time.

 

(ii) _Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each Spansion Restricted
Stock Unit and Spansion Performance Stock Unit that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
issuable (each, an " _Assumed Unit_ "), shall be assumed by Cypress;
_provided, however_ , that each Assumed Unit shall be converted into an award
to receive that number of

 



4  shares of Cypress Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of shares of Spansion Common Stock subject to such Assumed Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the nearest whole share of Cypress Common Stock. Each Assumed Unit
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including as to
vesting and issuance) as were applicable under the respective Spansion
Restricted Stock Unit or Spansion Performance Stock Unit, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each Assumed Unit that
was granted with a purchase price other than par value shall have a
purchase price per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
per share purchase price of Spansion Common Stock subject to such Assumed Unit
by (y) the Exchange Ratio (which price per share shall be rounded up to the
nearest whole cent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Restricted Stock
Unit or Performance Stock Unit is subject to the Legal Requirements of a
non-U.S. jurisdiction and Cypress determines (in good faith and upon advice
from Cypresss legal counsel) the Restricted Stock Unit or Performance Stock
Unit may not be converted into an Assumed Unit under a Legal Requirement of
the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction (including without limitation by reason of
a failure to obtain any required regulatory consents or approvals after
making reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such consents or approvals)
(such Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units, the " _Unassumed
Non-U.S. Units_ "), Cypress shall, to ensure compliance with applicable Legal
Requirements: (A) provide for acceleration and conversion of the Unassumed
Non-U.S. Units into the right to receive, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (x) the Closing
Average by (y) the number of Spansion shares subject to such Unassumed
Non-U.S. Unit, less all applicable deductions and withholdings required by
applicable Legal Requirements to be withheld in respect of such payment;
or (B) provide for such other treatment that is in compliance with applicable
Legal Requirements and reasonably agreed upon by Cypress and Spansion at least
twenty (20) days prior to the Effective Time.

 

(iii) _Registration Statements for Assumed Options and Other Awards_. As soon
as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten
(10) business days following the Effective Time, Cypress shall file a
registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8, Form S-3 or
another appropriate form (and use its reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness thereof and maintain the current status of the prospectuses
contained therein) relating to shares of Cypress Common Stock issuable with
respect to all Assumed Options, Assumed Units and the Common Stock
Consideration payable in exchange for Spansion Restricted Stock, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain
in effect for so long as such Assumed Options or Assumed Units remain
outstanding.

 

1.5 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes or intent of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Spansion and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of Spansion and Merger
Sub shall have the authority to take all such lawful and necessary action.

1.6 _Tax Reorganization_. The parties hereto intend, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, that the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement is hereby
adopted as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

event within one (1) Business Day) following the Effective Time, Cypress shall
make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this 
_Article I_, the shares of Cypress Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section
1.4(b)(i)_ in exchange for shares of Spansion Common Stock, and the cash
payable pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ in lieu of fractional shares of
Cypress Common Stock. In addition, Cypress shall make available from time to
time after the Effective Time as necessary, cash in an amount sufficient to

Corporation or otherwise according to the instruction of Cypress or the
Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates or Book Entry
Shares who have not surrendered such Certificates or Book Entry Shares in
compliance with this _Section 2.3_ shall after such delivery to Cypress and
the Surviving Corporation look only to Cypress and the Surviving Corporation
for delivery or payment of the shares of Cypress Common Stock issuable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(i)_, cash payable in respect
thereof pursuant to  _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ in lieu of any fractional shares of

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable (but in any event within
two (2) Business Days) following the Effective Time, Cypress shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Spansion Common Stock (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
non-certificated shares of Spansion Common Stock represented by book entry ("
_Book Entry Shares_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form as
Spansion and Cypress may reasonably agree (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates (or effective 

 



9  affidavits in lieu thereof) or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book Entry Shares in exchange for certificates representing whole shares of
Cypress Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(i)_, cash payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ in lieu of any fractional shares of
Cypress Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_. With respect to uncertificated

of such directly registered uncertificated shares of Spansion Common Stock for
shares of Cypress Common Stock and payment of cash in lieu of any fractional
shares pursuant to  _Section 1.4(b)(i)_, as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time. Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits in
lieu thereof) or Book Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or
to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Cypress, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates or Book Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the number of whole
shares of Cypress Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or
such Book Entry Shares surrendered by such holder of record) such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ (which, at the election
of Cypress, may be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested by the holder of record or is otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirements), payment of any cash such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ in lieu of fractional
shares of Cypress Common Stock and any dividends or distributions such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_, which shares and cash
Cypress shall cause the Exchange Agent to distribute as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) following
surrender of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares and such duly completed
and validly executed letter of transmittal, and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose for an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book Entry
Shares on the cash amounts payable upon the surrender of such Certificates
or such Book Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.3_. Until so
surrendered, from and after the Effective Time outstanding Certificates or
Book Entry Shares shall be deemed to evidence only the ownership of the number
of full shares of Cypress Common Stock into which such shares of Spansion
Common Stock shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount
in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with
_Section 1.4(b)(i)_ and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3(d)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Certificates and Book Entry Shares to be exchanged by any Person constituting
an "affiliate" of Spansion for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act
shall be subject to the restrictions described in such Rule 145.

(d) _Dividends and Distributions_. Whenever a dividend or other distribution
is declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Cypress Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time, such declaration shall include a
dividend or other distribution in respect of all shares of Cypress Common
Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Cypress Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of
any unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares with respect to the shares
of Cypress Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of
such Certificates or such Book Entry Shares shall surrender such Certificates
or such Book Entry Shares. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, following
surrender of any such Certificates or such Book Entry Shares, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest,
promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of Cypress Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor along with any such dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Cypress Common Stock.

 



10 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the shares of
Cypress Common Stock issuable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
1.4(b)(i)_, the cash payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
1.4(b)(i)_ in lieu of fractional shares of Cypress Common Stock and any
dividends or distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
2.3(d)_; provided, however, that Cypress may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owners of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such reasonable and
customary amount as Cypress may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Cypress, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

(f) _Transferred Shares_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares
of Spansion Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of Spansion, or if shares of Cypress Common Stock are to be issued in a
name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange
therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the Certificates so surrendered are properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has
paid to Cypress (or any agent designated by Cypress) any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Cypress Common Stock in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Cypress (or any agent
designated by Cypress) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or
are otherwise not payable.

(g) _Tax Withholding._ Each of the Exchange Agent, Cypress and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Spansion
Capital Stock, such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non U.S. tax
law or under any applicable Legal Requirement and to request and receive from
such holder or former holder any relevant tax forms, including Form W-9 or the
appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, or similar information. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

(h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Cypress, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Cypress Common
Stock or Spansion Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Legal Requirement.

if applicable, subsection) to which such exception relates (it
being understood and hereby agreed that any disclosure in the Spansion
Disclosure Letter relating to one Section or subsection shall also apply to
any other Sections and subsections if and to the extent that it is readily

Sections or subsections), or (ii) as set forth in any Spansion SEC Reports
filed with, or furnished to, the SEC and publicly available prior to the date

qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character or location of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities

failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Spansion
Material Adverse Effect.

3.2 _Authority; Approvals and Enforceability_.

 

(a) Spansion has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and

the Spansion Board has unanimously determined that this Agreement and the
Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the
best interests of the Spansion stockholders and has unanimously resolved to
recommend that the Spansion Stockholders adopt this Agreement (the "
_Spansion Voting Proposal_ "). Prior to making the foregoing determinations,

Stanley_ ") to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon
and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth
therein, the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Spansion Common Stock (other than
shares of Spansion Common Stock that are owned by Cypress, Merger Sub, or
Spansion, or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Cypress,
Merger Sub, or Spansion, in each case immediately prior to the Effective
Time), and as of the date hereof the foregoing opinion has not been withdrawn,
revoked or modified in any respect.

(c) Except for the approval of the Spansion Voting Proposal by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Spansion Common Stock entitled to vote at a meeting of the Spansion
Stockholders called to consider the Spansion Voting Proposal (the "
_Requisite Spansion Stockholder Approval_ ") and assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.23_ of this Agreement,
no other corporate proceedings on the part of Spansion are necessary to
approve or adopt this Agreement under applicable Legal Requirements and to
consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with the terms hereof.

 

(d) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Spansion, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Cypress
and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Spansion, enforceable against Spansion in accordance with its terms, except
insofar as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Legal Requirements

availability of equitable remedies.

Subsidiary of Spansion is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation
to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction (to the extent
such concepts exist in such jurisdictions) where the character or location of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Spansion
Material Adverse Effect.

Spansion any other party to a Spansion IP License, is in material breach of

termination, impairment or restriction of any right or license granted to
Spansion or any of its Subsidiaries under a Spansion IP License, or (iii)

in excess of two-million dollars ($2,000,000), that as of the Effective Time,
will not be offset by insurance or fully accrued and, except as required by a
Legal Requirement, no condition exists that would prevent Spansion or Cypress
from terminating or amending any such Spansion Employee Plan at any time for

Cypress and Merger Sub, and assuming due authorization, execution and

Spansion or another Subsidiary or Affiliate of Cypress, is set forth in
_Section 4.6_ of the Cypress Disclosure Letter. Cypress does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity, voting or

organization (to the extent such concepts exist in such jurisdictions) and has
all requisite corporate or other power and authority necessary to enable it to
own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, lease or operate
and to conduct its business as it is currently conducted, except to the extent
that the failure to be so organized or existing or in good standing or have
such power or authority would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Cypress Material Adverse Effect. Each
Subsidiary of Cypress is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation
to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction (to the extent
such concepts exist in such jurisdictions) where the character or location of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except to the extent that
the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Cypress
Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.7 _SEC Reports_. Cypress has filed and made available to Spansion (including
via the SECs EDGAR system) all forms, reports, schedules, statements and
other documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed by

of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or

structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand (such as any arrangement described in Section 303(a)(4) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC)) where the purpose or effect of such arrangement is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Cypress or any of its Subsidiaries in Cypresss consolidated
financial statements.

 

(f) Neither Cypress nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of
Cypress, any director, officer, auditor, accountant, consultant

assertion or claim that Cypress or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices. No current or former attorney
representing Cypress or any of its Subsidiaries has reported evidence of a

violation by Cypress or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents
to the current the Cypress Board or any committee thereof or to any current
director or executive officer of Cypress.

the date hereof, Cypress has conducted its business in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and, since such date through the date

any action taken by Cypress or event that would have required the consent of
Spansion pursuant to _Sections 5.2_ had such action or event occurred after
the date of this Agreement.

4.11  _Real Property_. Cypress and each of its Subsidiaries have good and
valid title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all the real properties
which it purports to own or lease, including all the real properties reflected

All real property leases, subleases, licenses or other occupancy agreements to
which Cypress or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (collectively, the "
_Cypress Real Property Leases_ ") are in full force and effect, except where
the failure of such Cypress Real Property Leases to be in full force and
effect would not be reasonably likely to result in a Cypress Material Adverse
Effect. There is no default by Cypress or any of its Subsidiaries under any
of the Cypress Real Property Leases, or, to the knowledge of Cypress, defaults
by any other party thereto, except such defaults as have been waived in
writing or cured or such defaults that in the aggregate would not be

4.13 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) _Section 4.13(a)_ of the Cypress Disclosure Letter contains a complete
and accurate list of all Patents or other Intellectual Property Rights that
are Registered Intellectual Property owned by or registered in the name of
Cypress or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively the " _Cypress Registered

Property is, to the knowledge of Cypress, subsisting and neither invalid nor
unenforceable.

 



35 (b) All material Cypress Registered Intellectual Property Rights that are
owned by Cypress or a Subsidiary of Cypress are owned by Cypress or one or
more of its Subsidiaries free and clear of any material Liens (excluding any

that are owned by Cypress or a Subsidiary of Cypress are, and immediately
following the transactions contemplated hereby shall be, freely, transferable,
licensable and alienable without the consent of, or notice or payment of any
kind to any Governmental Authority or third party. Neither Cypress nor any of

Property Rights that are or were material Cypress Intellectual Property
Rights and that are or were owned by Cypress or a Subsidiary of Cypress.

of Cypress and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, knowingly infringed
upon, violated or used without authorization or license, any Intellectual
Property Rights owned by any third Person, except as would not be material to
or create material Liability for the business of Cypress and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. There is no pending or, to Cypresss knowledge, threatened
(and at no time within the three (3) years prior to the date of this Agreement
has there been pending any) suit, arbitration or other adversarial proceeding
before any court, government agency or arbitral tribunal, or in any
jurisdiction, against Cypress or any of its Subsidiaries, alleging that any
activities, products or conduct of Cypresss or any of its Subsidiaries
business infringes upon, violates or constitutes the unauthorized use of the
Intellectual Property Rights of any third Person, or challenging the
ownership, validity, or enforceability of any Cypress Intellectual Property
Rights. Cypress is not party to any settlements, consents, decrees,
stipulations, judgments, or orders resulting from suits, actions or similar
legal proceedings, which (i) materially restrict Cypresss or any of its
Subsidiaries rights to use, license or transfer any material
Cypress Intellectual Property Rights, or (ii) compel or require Cypress or
any of its Subsidiaries to license or transfer any material Cypress
Intellectual Property Rights.

 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 3.13(d)_ of the Cypress Disclosure
Letter, there are no pending claims, suits, arbitrations or other adversarial

any Cypress Intellectual Property Rights, which remain unresolved as of
the date hereof.

and accurate list of all material Contracts pursuant to which Cypress or any
of its Subsidiaries has granted a third Person or Affiliate any rights or
licenses to any material Cypress Intellectual Property Rights other than non-
exclusive licenses granted in the ordinary course of business (" _Cypress Out
Licenses_ ," and together with the Cypress In Licenses, the " _Cypress IP
Licenses_ ").

 

(g) Neither Cypress nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of
Cypress any other party to a Cypress IP License, is in material breach of any
such Cypress IP License that is material to the business of Cypress and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not result or cause: (A) (i) the breach by Cypress
or any of its Subsidiaries of any Cypress IP License, (ii) the forfeiture,
termination, impairment or restriction of any right or license granted to
Cypress or any of its Subsidiaries under a Cypress IP License, or (iii)
Cypress or any of its 

 



36  Subsidiaries to grant, or expand the scope of a prior grant, to a third
party of any rights to any material Cypress Intellectual Property Rights
(including by release of any source code), except (with respect to clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii)) as would not reasonably be expected to have a Cypress
Material Adverse Effect, (B) as a result of any Contract to which Cypress or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party, a third party to become licensed to, or
otherwise have rights to, any material Intellectual Property Rights of
Spansion or any of its Subsidiaries, or (C) cause any royalties fees or other
payments to become payable by Cypress or any of its Subsidiaries to any
third person as a result of the use of any material Intellectual Property
Rights by Cypress or any of its Subsidiaries or cause any existing obligations
to pay such royalties, fees or other payments to materially increase (other
than due to increased sales of Cypresss Products).

(h) To the knowledge of Cypress, Cypress and its Subsidiaries are in material
compliance with all their respective obligations pursuant to any Public
Software license agreements under which they license-in Technology that is
included in any Cypress Product distributed by Cypress.

Subsidiaries;

Legal Requirement, no condition exists that would prevent Cypress or Spansion

of repurchase rights or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due
any such employee, director or officer, (iii) result in the forgiveness of
indebtedness, or (iv) trigger an obligation to fund benefits. No payment or
benefit which will or may be made by Cypress or its ERISA Affiliates with
respect to any current or former employee or any other "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Code Section 280G and the regulations thereunder)
is reasonably expected to be characterized as a "parachute payment," within
the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. There is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement to which Cypress or any of its ERISA
Affiliates is a party or by which it is bound to compensate any current or

contemplated by this Agreement, and incorporate the other partys reasonable
comments thereto, (iii) not participate in any substantive meeting or

days) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Cypress and
Spansion shall prepare, and Cypress shall file with the SEC, a Registration

Spansion and Cypress shall, and shall cause its respective representatives
to, fully cooperate with the other party hereto and its respective
Representatives in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall furnish the other party hereto with all

provide the other party hereto with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. As promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement
is declared effective by the SEC, Cypress and Spansion shall cause the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to their respective stockholders.

(b) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no amendment or
supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Registration

(including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment
to effect such change, and in such event, the right of approval set forth in
this  _Section 7.3(b)_ shall apply only with respect to such information
relating to the other party or its business, financial condition or results of
operations, and shall be subject to the right of each party to have its board
of directors deliberations and conclusions be accurately described therein.

Statement shall not, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the
SEC or declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied by either party hereto
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall not, on the date the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto)
is first mailed to stockholders, at the time of each of the Merger
Stockholder Meetings, or as of the Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In
addition, the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of either
party hereto for inclusion in any filing pursuant to Rule 165 and

 



56  Rule 425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act
(each, a " _Regulation M-A Filing_") shall not, at the time any such
Regulation M-A Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective
Time (i) Spansion and Cypress shall notify each other as promptly as
practicable upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance which should be
described in an amendment of, or supplement to, the Registration Statement,
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing so that any
such document would not include any misstatement of material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and as promptly
as practicable thereafter, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Legal Requirements or the SEC, disseminated to the
stockholders of Spansion and/or Cypress. Spansion and Cypress shall each
notify the other as promptly as practicable after the receipt by such party of
any written or oral comments of the SEC or its staff on, or of any written or
oral request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to, the
Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation
M-A Filing, and shall promptly supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its representatives and the SEC or its
staff with respect to any of the foregoing filings.

(e) Spansion and Cypress shall make any necessary filings with respect to the
Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and

the Cypress Voting Proposal in the case of Cypress. Each of Spansion and
Cypress shall solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Spansion
Voting Proposal in the case of Spansion and the Cypress Voting Proposal in the

shall effect a Spansion Board Recommendation Change in the case of Spansion
or a Cypress Board Recommendation Change in the case of Cypress, in each case
pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.4(f)_, use its reasonable best
efforts to secure the Requisite Spansion Stockholder Approval in the case of
Spansion and the Requisite Cypress Stockholder Approval in the case of

57 (b) Each of Spansion and Cypress shall use its reasonable best efforts to
call, give notice of, convene and hold their respective Merger Stockholder
Meetings on the same day and at the same time; _provided_ , that such efforts
shall not require either Spansion or Cypress to delay the meeting of its
stockholders beyond the date that is forty-five (45) days after the
declaration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of Spansion or
Cypress, after consultation with the other party hereto, may (but shall not
be required to) adjourn or postpone its respective Merger Stockholder Meeting
if (and solely to the extent and for the minimum duration reasonably necessary
to ensure that) (i) any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to its respective stockholders within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of its respective Merger Stockholder
Meeting, (ii) as of the time for which the applicable Merger Stockholder
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient shares of Spansion Common Stock
in the case of Spansion, or Cypress Common Stock in the case of Cypress,
represented (either in person or by proxy) at the respective Merger
Stockholder meeting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the respective Merger Stockholder Meeting, or (iii) the other party hereto
has adjourned or postponed its Merger Stockholder Meeting for any of the
foregoing reasons.

Stockholders at the Spansion Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of acting
upon such proposal, and Cypress shall submit the Cypress Voting Proposal to
the Cypress Stockholders at the Cypress Stockholders Meeting for the purpose
of acting upon such proposal, in each case whether or not (i) the Spansion
Board or the Cypress Board, as the case may be, at any time subsequent to the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Merger Stockholder Meetings shall
effect a Spansion Board Recommendation Change in the case of Spansion or a
Cypress Board Recommendation Change in the case of Cypress, or (ii) any
actual, potential or purported Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal has
been commenced, disclosed, announced or submitted to the Spansion Board in
the case of Spansion or the Cypress Board in the case of Cypress.

(e) Subject to the terms of  _Section 7.4(f)_, (i) the Spansion Board shall

Board (nor any committee thereof) shall withhold, withdraw, amend, modify,
qualify or condition, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend,
modify, qualify or condition, the Spansion Board Recommendation (a " _Spansion
Board Recommendation Change_ "), and (y) neither the Cypress Board nor any
committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend, modify, qualify or
condition, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify, qualify
or condition, the Cypress Board Recommendation (a " _Cypress Board
Recommendation Change_ "); _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Spansion
Stockholder Approval in the case of Spansion, or receipt of the Requisite
Cypress Stockholder Approval in the case of Cypress, the Spansion Board may
effect a Spansion Board Recommendation Change and the Cypress Board may effect
a Cypress Board Recommendation Change, in either case if and only if either:

(i) (A) the party proposing to take such action has received an Acquisition
Proposal relating to such party that the board of directors of such party has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors) constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) such Acquisition Proposal did
not result from or arise out of a breach of any provisions of  _Section 6.1_
or _Section 6.2_, (C) the party proposing to take such action has not
breached any of the provisions of _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ in respect
of such Acquisition Proposal, (D) prior to effecting such Spansion Board
Recommendation Change or Cypress Board Recommendation Change, as the case may
be, the party proposing to take such action shall have given the other party
hereto at least five (5) business days notice thereof (which notice shall
not, by itself, constitute a Spansion Board Recommendation Change or a Cypress
Board Recommendation Change) and the opportunity to meet and discuss in good
faith potential amendments or other modifications to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that the Merger and other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be effected, (E) the other party hereto shall not have
made, within the foregoing five (5) business days after receipt of
such partys written notice of its intention to effect a Spansion Board
Recommendation Change or a Cypress Board Recommendation Change, as the case
may be, a counteroffer or proposal that the board of directors of the party
proposing to take such action (or an authorized committee thereof established
solely to address a conflict of interest with the Person making such Superior
Proposal or such Superior Proposal itself) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and
its outside legal counsel) is at least as favorable to its stockholders as
such Superior Proposal, and (F) after such discussions, the board of directors
of the party proposing to take such action (or an authorized committee
thereof established solely to address a conflict of interest with the Person
making such Superior Proposal or such Superior Proposal itself) determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
after considering in good faith any counteroffer or proposal made by the
other party hereto pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (E)) that the
failure to effect such Spansion Board Recommendation Change or a Cypress Board
Recommendation Change, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law; or

(ii) in response to an Intervening Event, if: (A) the Intervening Event does
not involve the receipt of any offer, proposal or inquiry from any third party
relating to a transaction of the nature described in the definition of
"Acquisition Transaction" (which, for the purposes of this clause (A), shall
be read without reference to the percentage thresholds set forth in the
definition thereof); and (B) (1) prior to effecting the Spansion Board
Recommendation Change or the Cypress Board Recommendation Change, as the case
may be, the party proposing to take such action shall have given the other
party hereto at least five (5) business days notice thereof (which notice
shall not, by itself, constitute a Spansion Board Recommendation Change or a
Cypress Board Recommendation Change) and the opportunity to meet and discuss
in good faith the purported basis for the proposed the Spansion Board
Recommendation Change or the Cypress Board Recommendation Change, as the case
may be, the other partys reaction thereto and potential amendments and
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in response
thereto so that the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be effected, and (2) after such discussions, the board of
directors of the party proposing to take such action (or an authorized
committee thereof established solely to address conflicts of interest)
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
the failure to effect such Spansion Board Recommendation Change or Cypress
Board Recommendation Change, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

Each of Spansion and Cypress acknowledge and hereby agree that any Spansion
Board Recommendation Change or Cypress Board Recommendation Change effected
(or proposed to be effected) in response to or in connection with a Superior
Proposal may be made solely and exclusively pursuant to the immediately
preceding clause (i) only, and may not be made pursuant to the immediately
preceding clause (ii), and any Spansion Board Recommendation Change or
Cypress Board Recommendation Change, as the case may be, may only be made
pursuant to this _Section 7.4(f)_ and no other provisions of this Agreement.

 



59 (g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Spansion Board or the Cypress
Board from taking and disclosing to the Spansion Stockholders or the Cypress
Stockholders, respectively, a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under
the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that (i) neither Spansion (with
respect to statements made by the Spansion Board) nor Cypress (with respect to
statements made by the Cypress Board) pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act or Rule 14(d)-9 under the Exchange Act shall make
disclosures that would amount to a Spansion Board Recommendation Change or a
Cypress Board Recommendation Change, other than pursuant to this  _Section
7.4(g)_, and (ii) any statements or disclosures regarding this Agreement, the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or about any
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or Acquisition
Transaction shall constitute a Spansion Board Recommendation Change or a
Cypress Board Recommendation Change, as the case may be, unless such statement
or disclosure is accompanied by an express, unequivocal affirmation of the
Spansion Board Recommendation or the Cypress Board Recommendation, as
applicable.

(h) Nothing set forth in this _Section 7.4_ shall (i) permit either party
hereto to terminate this Agreement, (ii) affect any other obligation of the
parties hereto under this Agreement, (iii) limit the obligation of either
party hereto to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold its respective

Meeting, or (v) permit either party hereto to submit for a vote of its
respective stockholders at or prior to its respective Merger Stockholder
Meeting any Acquisition Proposal other than the Spansion Voting Proposal and
the Cypress Voting Proposal, as applicable.

"Change of Control" within the meaning of such term as set forth in the
agreements listed on  _Section 7.7(e)_ of the Spansion Disclosure Letter.

7.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and Spansion shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of Spansion and its Subsidiaries under any and
all indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time between Spansion or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director
or officer of Spansion or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, for a period of six (6) years
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall, and Cypress shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, cause their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(and other similar organizational documents) to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of
Spansion and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any respect except as and to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements.

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Cypress shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect the existing policy of Spansions directors and officers
liability insurance (the " _Spansion D andO Policy_") covering claims arising
from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement
and the consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to the extent that such acts or omissions are covered by the
Spansion DandO Policy) and covering each Indemnified Party who is covered as of
the Effective Time by the Spansion DandO Policy on terms with respect to
coverage and amounts that are no less favorable than those terms in effect on
the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Cypress or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in
excess of 250% of the current annual premium paid by Spansion (which annual
premium is set forth on _Section 7.8(b)_ of the Spansion Disclosure Letter)
for such insurance (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "),
_provided_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain, and
Cypress shall cause and financially enable it to obtain, a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, in lieu of its obligations

 



63  under this _Section 7.8(b)_, Cypress or Spansion may purchase a six-year
"tail" prepaid policy on the Spansion DandO Policy on terms and conditions no
less advantageous than, from an issuer with an AM Best rating no worse than
the issuer of, the Spansion DandO Policy, and in the event that Cypress shall
purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Cypress shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder in lieu of all other obligations of
Cypress and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.8(b)_ for so
long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Cypress shall purchase, for the benefit of the directors and
officers of Cypress, liability insurance with a coverage limit of no less than
$50,000,000, or such other amount as is mutually agreed by Spansion and
Cypress.

(d) The obligations under this _Section 7.8_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under
the Spansion DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.8(b)_
(and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of
such affected Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the
Spansion DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section
7.8(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified
Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the Spansion DandO Policy
or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.8(b)_ (and their heirs
and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 7.8_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The
rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries
under the Spansion DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section
7.8(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 7.8_ shall
be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that
such persons may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation,
bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all
indemnification agreements of or entered into by Spansion or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Legal Requirement (whether at law or in equity).

(e) In the event that Cypress, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
at least fifty percent (50%) of its properties and assets to any other
person, then in each case proper provision shall be made so that the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns,
if applicable), or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.8._

7.9 _Listing of Cypress Shares_. Cypress shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have authorized for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market
prior to the Effective Time, upon official notice of issuance, the shares of
Cypress Common Stock issuable in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement, the
shares of Cypress Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all Assumed
Options and the shares of Cypress Common Stock issuable in respect of all
Assumed Units, and any shares of Cypress Common Stock issuable upon exchange
of the Exchangeable Senior Notes at and after the Effective Time.

7.10 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Spansion and the Spansion Board shall promptly grant such approvals and take
such lawful actions as are necessary so that the Merger and/or such other
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement, and otherwise take such lawful actions to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, and any regulations
promulgated thereunder, on the Merger and such other transactions.

 



64 7.11 _Section 16 Matters_. The Cypress Board, or a committee thereof
consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of
the Effective Time providing that the receipt by Spansion Insiders of Cypress
Common Stock in exchange for shares of Spansion Common Stock, and of options
to purchase Cypress Common Stock upon assumption and conversion of the
Spansion Stock Awards, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16
Information, is intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act. In addition, the Spansion Board, or a committee thereof
consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of
Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of
the Effective Time providing that the disposition by Spansion Insiders of
Spansion Common Stock in exchange for shares of Cypress Common Stock, and
the disposition of their Spansion Stock Awards which will be deemed to occur
upon the assumption of those options and their resulting conversion into
options to purchase Cypress Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed
in the Section 16 Information, are also intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 

7.12 _Tax Matters_.

(a) None of Cypress, Merger Sub or Spansion shall, and they shall not permit
any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action prior to or following
the Effective Time that would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to
fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

(b) Each of Cypress and Spansion shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Tax opinions described in _Section 2.2(a)(vii)_ (collectively, the

Corporation, counsel to Cypress, and Fenwick and West LLP, counsel to Spansion,

the Registration and the Effective Time, in connection with their respective
deliveries of opinions with respect to the Tax treatment of the Merger.

 

7.13 _FIRPTA Certificate_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Spansion shall
deliver to Cypress a properly executed statement in a form reasonably
acceptable to Cypress for purposes of satisfying Cypresss obligations under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

 

7.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Cypress shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

7.15 _Exchangeable Senior Notes_. As promptly as practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Cypress and Spansion shall prepare
a supplemental indenture (the " _Supplemental Indenture_ ") as required by
Sections 5.02 and 10.05 of the indenture, dated as of August 26, 2013 (as
amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the " _Indenture_ "), by
and among Spansion LLC, the guarantors party thereto, including Spansion, and
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the " _Trustee_ "),
governing the 2.00% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2020 (the " _Exchangeable
Senior Notes_ ") of Spansion LLC. On the Closing Date, Cypress, Spansion,
Spansion LLC and the guarantors party thereto shall execute with the Trustee
the Supplemental Indenture, effective as of the Effective Time, and deliver
any required certificates, legal opinions and other documents required by the

(it being understood and hereby agreed that the failure to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ promptly following a Triggering Event
shall not prejudice or otherwise limit or impair such partys ability to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ at any subsequent point
in time and collect the fee contemplated by this _Section 9.3(c)(iii)_);
_provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, the fee contemplated
by this _Section 9.3(c)(iii)_ shall not be payable in the event that the
Cypress Board shall have effected a Cypress Board Recommendation Change (or
another Triggering Event described in clauses (iv) or (v) of the definition
thereof) at least ten (10) business days prior to the Cypress Stockholder
Meeting, Spansion does not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(f)_ within five (5) days thereafter, and subsequent thereto Cypress
obtains the Requisite Cypress Stockholder Approval at the Cypress Stockholder
Meeting.

(iv) In no event shall Cypress be required to pay the Termination Fee
pursuant to this _Section 9.3(c)_ on more than one occasion.

(v) Cypress shall reimburse Spansion for Spansions documented out-of-pocket
expenses actually incurred in connection with this Agreement (the " _Spansion
Expense Reimbursement_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated in writing by Spansion within three (3)
Business Days after demand by Spansion, in the event that (A) following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Cypress Stockholder
Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) at which a vote is taken
on the Cypress Voting Proposal, an Acquisition Proposal in respect of Cypress
shall have been made to Cypress or the Cypress Board, or shall have been
directly communicated or otherwise made known to Cypress Stockholders, or
shall have been publicly announced or shall have become publicly known, or any
Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional
and whether or not withdrawn) to make an Acquisition Proposal in respect of
Cypress, and (B) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_
(or after the Cypress Stockholder Meeting has been held and a vote taken on
the Cypress Voting Proposal and there has been a failure to obtain the
Requisite Cypress Stockholder Approval, and this Agreement thereby becomes
terminable pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ as a result, Cypress terminates
this Agreement for another reason); _provided, however_ , that (A)
Cypress shall not be obligated to pay any amounts in excess of five million
dollars ($5,000,000) pursuant to this _Section 9.3(c)(v),_ (B) if Cypress is
subsequently required to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to this  _Section
9.3(c)_, the amount of such payment shall be reduced by the amount of the
Spansion Expense Reimbursement previously paid to Spansion, and (C) for the
purposes of this _Section 9.3(c)(v)_, all references to 15% in the
definition of "Acquisition Transaction" shall be replaced by 50%.

(d) _Enforcement_. Each of Cypress and Spansion hereby acknowledge and agree
that the covenants and agreements set forth in this _Section 9.3_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, without
these covenants and agreements, the parties hereto would 

 



71  not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either Cypress or
Spansion shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to
_Section 9.3(b)_ or  _Section 9.3(c)_, as the case may be, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the other party hereto shall make a claim that results in
a judgment against the non-paying party, the non-paying party shall pay to the
claimant its reasonable costs and expenses (including its reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amounts set forth in _Section 9.3(b)_ or _Section
9.3(c)_, as the case may be, at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees described
in _Section 9.3(b)_ or _Section 9.3(c)_, as the case may be, shall not be in
lieu of, or replacement or substitution for, damages incurred in the event of
any breach of this Agreement or fraud.
