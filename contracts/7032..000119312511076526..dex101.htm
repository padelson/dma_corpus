the applicable Per Share Payment and a portion (if any) of the Escrow Funds
and the Representative Expense Amount as provided herein. The Company shall
give Parent prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal with respect
to Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in

satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares, and, from and
after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates representing ownership
of Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares,
except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the

credit relating to an overpayment of Excluded Stub Period Taxes) including, in
each case, any interest paid thereon of the Group Companies for any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date and for the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, treating the pre-Closing portion
of any such Straddle Period as a separate taxable period and Sellers shall be
entitled to the excess of any refund of Pre-Closing Taxes to the extent
not constituting Excluded Stub Period Taxes (or credit relating to an
overpayment of such Pre-Closing Taxes not constituting Excluded Stub Period
Taxes), but only to the extent such Tax refund (or credit) claim is ultimately
successful and originally made prior to the end of the Escrow Period. Within
four Business Days after receipt by Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of
its Subsidiaries of any Tax refund to which Sellers are entitled, Purchaser or
the Surviving Entity shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to,
deliver and pay over, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, such
Tax refunds to the Representative (on behalf of Sellers). Parent will, and
will cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to, execute such
documents, take reasonable additional actions and otherwise reasonably
cooperate as may be necessary for Parent, the Surviving Entity and their
Subsidiaries to perfect their rights in and obtain all Tax refunds for which
any such Person is eligible and to which Sellers are entitled. For purposes
of this Section 6.2(a), Parent shall cause each Group Company _first_ to
utilize any available net operating losses or other tax attributes existing on
or prior to the Closing Date in any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law and _second_
to utilize any available net operating loss or other tax attribute existing on
or prior to the Closing Date in any Straddle Period to the maximum extent
permitted under applicable law.

(b) All transfer Taxes, recording fees and other similar Taxes that are
imposed on any of the parties hereto by any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by Parent.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other
hand, shall provide the other party with such information and records and
make such of its

 



41  officers, directors, employees, and agents available as may reasonably be
requested by such other party in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Return or any audit or other proceeding that relates to Tax matters.

(d) Parent shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax
Returns of the Group Companies for all taxable periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date that are required to be filed after the Closing Date as well
as all Tax Returns for any Straddle Period. For the purpose of preparing such
Tax Returns, Parent shall cause each Group Company first to utilize any
available net operating losses or other tax attributes existing on or prior to
the Closing Date in any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date to
the maximum extent permitted under applicable law and second to utilize any
available net operating loss or other tax attribute existing on or prior to
the Closing Date in any Straddle Period to the maximum extent permitted under
applicable law. Parent shall provide such Tax Returns to the Representative
for review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to their filing, and
shall not file such Tax Returns without the Representatives prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. Failure
of the Representative to provide timely written objection to such Tax Returns
within twenty (20) days of the receipt thereof shall be deemed consent to the
preparation and filing of such Tax Returns by Parent. Parent and the
Sellers agree to consult and resolve in good faith any objections of the
Representative with respect to such Tax Returns. For the avoidance of doubt,
failure of the Parent to comply with the second sentence of this Section
6.2(d) shall constitute reasonable grounds for the Representative to delay or
withhold consent.

(e) Without the prior written consent of the Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld, Parent shall not file or cause
to be filed any amended Tax Return of the Group Companies for any taxable
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date or for any Straddle Period
unless (i) required by applicable law or (ii) the filing of such amended Tax
Return (x) will not cause Sellers to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Agreement and (y) will not result in any Tax liability for
Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers (other than any Group Company after the
Closing Date). Parent shall provide such Tax Returns for which the
Representatives consent is required to the Representative for review and
comment at least twenty (20) days prior to their filing. Failure of the
Representative to provide timely written objection to such amended Tax Returns
within twenty (20) days of the receipt thereof shall be deemed consent to the
preparation and filing of such Tax Returns by Parent. Parent and the Sellers
agree to consult and resolve in good faith any objections of the
Representative with respect to such Tax Returns. For the avoidance of doubt,
failure of the Parent to comply with the first sentence of this Section
6.2(e) shall constitute reasonable grounds for the Representative to delay or
withhold consent.

 

Section 6.3. _Access to Information_. From and after the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, upon reasonable notice, and subject to restrictions
contained in the confidentiality agreements to which the Group Companies are
subject, the Company shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub and their
authorized representatives during normal business hours reasonable access to
all properties, books and records of the Group Companies (in a manner so as to
not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of any
Group Company). All of such information shall be treated as confidential
information pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the
provisions of which are by this reference hereby incorporated herein.

 



42 Section 6.4. _Efforts to Consummate_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take,

promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing
conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ ). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consents of all
Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(b) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding
by any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced which questions the
validity or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages
in connection therewith, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and
use commercially reasonable efforts to defend against such claim, action,
suit, investigation or other proceeding and, if an injunction or other order
is issued in any such action, suit or other proceeding, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted, and to
cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , however, that each party hereto
has no duty to agree to any structure or conduct remedy or to litigate with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Closing, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto of any communication it or its controlled Affiliates receives
from any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of
this Agreement and permit the other parties hereto to review in advance any
proposed communication by it to any Governmental Entity. Prior to the Closing,
no party hereto shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry unless it consults with the other parties hereto in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other parties
hereto the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Prior to the
Closing, each party hereto will provide the other parties hereto with copies
of all correspondence or communications between it or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.5. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) Parent and the Company agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by the
laws of the State of Delaware, all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liability for acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Closing Date now existing in favor of the current directors and
officers of the Company, as provided in the Governing Documents of the
Company, or in any agreements between the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and any of their current directors or officers, on the other
hand, will survive the Closing and will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms for a period of not less than six years
after the Closing Date (or, in the case of any agreement, in accordance with
its terms).

 



43 (b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity after the Effective
Time, to maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect, for its full
term, and to continue to honor its respective obligations thereunder.

 

(c) This _Section 6.5_ shall be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, the current directors and officers of the Company, and their respective
heirs, executor, administrators and estates.

Section 6.6. _Exclusive Dealing_. No Group Company shall, directly or
indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative (including
for greater certainty any financial, legal or other advisors), or any Seller
or any Affiliate or representative of any Seller (a) solicit, assist,
initiate, encourage or otherwise facilitate (including by way of furnishing
information or permitting any visit to any facilities or properties of the
Company) proposals or offers regarding any Alternative Proposal; (b) engage
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any information with
respect to, any Alternative Proposal; or (c) accept or enter into, or publicly
propose to accept or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, agreement, arrangement or undertaking related to any
Alternative Proposal.

Section 6.7. _Documents and Information_. After the Closing Date, Parent and

available for inspection and copying by the Representative (at
Representatives expense) during normal business hours of the Surviving
Entity or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon reasonable request and
upon reasonable notice.

 

Section 6.8. _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations_.
During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Parent hereby agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and
shall not permit any of its employees, agents, representatives or controlled
Affiliates to) contact any employee (excluding executive officers), customer,
supplier, distributor or other material business relation of any Group Company
regarding any Group Company, its business or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without the prior consent of the Company.

Section 6.9. _Employee Benefits Matters_. 

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide employees of each Group
Company who continue to be employed by a Group Company with the same salary or
hourly wage rate as provided to such employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date and with employee benefits (excluding equity arrangements) that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent. Parent further agrees that, from
and after the Closing Date, Parent shall and shall cause each Group
Company to grant all of its

 



44  employees credit for any service with such Group Company earned prior to the
Closing Date (a) for eligibility and vesting purposes and (b) for purposes of
vacation accrual and severance benefit determinations (to the extent years of
service is relevant to the level of benefits for which an employee is
eligible) under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement that may be established or maintained by Parent or the Surviving
Entity or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date (the " _New
Plans_ "); _provided_ , however, that in no event shall such service credit
result in any duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee under any Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and (ii) cause
any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on or
before the Closing Date by any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of any
Group Company to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the
corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions
after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan in the year of initial
participation. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any employee of any Group Company any right to continued
employment for any period or continued receipt of any specific employee
benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any
New Plan or Employee Benefit Plan. Parent agrees that Parent and the Surviving
Entity shall be solely responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code for all individuals who are "MandA
qualified beneficiaries" as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 54.4980B-9. This _Section 6.9(a)_ is not intended, and shall not be
deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to
create any agreement of employment with any Person or to otherwise create any
third-party beneficiary hereto.

 

(b) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, each
Group Company shall terminate all Employee Benefit Plans that are intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement and shall provide Parent with
evidence that such Employee Benefit Plans have been terminated (effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time). Parent agrees
to take all actions reasonably required to provide that its employee pension
benefit plan that is intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement
shall accept rollovers from each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement, including with respect to plan
loans which are outstanding at the Effective Time. Each Group Company and
Parent shall cooperate in taking all other actions reasonably required in
furtherance of terminating such Employee Benefit Plans and distributing the
plan assets as described herein. In the event that termination of a Group
Companys 401(k) plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation
charges, surrender charges or other fees, then such Group Company shall take
such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than
five business days prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 6.10. _Updated Disclosure Schedules_. Concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Company and Sellers have delivered to
Parent and Merger Sub the disclosure schedules to this Agreement (the "
_Schedules_ "). From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing
Date, the Company and/or Sellers may prepare and deliver to Parent

 



45  and Merger Sub supplements and/or amendments to the Schedules (which may
contain additional Schedules that are not in existence as of the date hereof
relating to any of the provisions contained in _ARTICLE III_ and/or _ARTICLE
IV_ , in each case, such supplement, amendment or new Schedule being referred
to as an " _Update_ ") with respect to matters first arising after the date
hereof; _provided_ , however, that no such Update shall be deemed to be an
amendment to this Agreement and shall not affect the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or the obligations set forth in _ARTICLE IX_.

 

Section 6.11. _No Public Disclosure_. No party hereto will issue or make any
report, statement or release to the public (including employees, customers
and suppliers of the parties) with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby without the consent of Parent and
the Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If any
party hereto is unable to obtain, after reasonable effort, the approval of its
public report, statement or release from the other parties hereto and such
report, statement or release is, in the opinion of legal counsel to
such party, required by law in order to discharge such partys disclosure
obligations, then such party may make or issue the legally required report,
statement or release and promptly furnish the other parties with a copy
thereof. Each party hereto will also obtain the prior approval by the other
parties hereto of any press release to be issued announcing the consummation
of the Merger. This _Section 6.11_ shall not restrict or prohibit any
disclosure by any Seller to its limited partners, investment funds affiliated
with such Seller, the investors in such investment funds, and Affiliates
(collectively, " _Investment Partners_ ") regarding this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby to the extent such Seller
reasonably determines in good faith that such announcement is necessary or
advisable. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that
each Seller and its Investment Partners (except for the Group Companies) may
provide general information about the subject matter of this Agreement in
connection with such Sellers or its Investment Partners fund raising,
marketing, informational or reporting activities in the ordinary course
of business.

Section 6.12. _Approval of Agreement and Merger_. Immediately following the
execution of this Agreement (but no later than 5:00 pm Eastern time on the
day following the date hereof), each Seller shall sign, date and deliver to
Parent the Written Consent evidencing its irrevocable adoption of this
Agreement and approval of this Agreement and the Merger, pursuant to, and in

(d) All indemnification payments under this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be adjustments

Section 9.3. _Claims_.

(a) Any party seeking indemnification under _Section 9.2_ (an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") shall promptly give the party from whom indemnification is being
sought (such notified party, the " _Responsible Party_ ") notice (a " _Claim
Notice_ ") of any matter which such Indemnified Party has determined has given
or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, stating
in reasonable detail, the nature of the claim, a good-faith reasonable
estimate of the Damage and method of computation thereof, and containing a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right
of indemnification is claimed or arises;  _provided_ that the failure to so
notify shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its obligations hereunder,
except to the extent that the Responsible Party is actually prejudiced
thereby. If the matter to which a claim relates shall not have been resolved
as of the date of the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party shall estimate in
good faith the amount of the claim in the Claim Notice, but also specify
therein that the claim has not yet been liquidated (an " _Unliquidated Claim_
" and, the Claim Notice in respect thereof, an " _Unliquidated Claim Notice_
"). If an Indemnified Party gives an Unliquidated Claim Notice, the
Indemnified Party shall also give a second Claim Notice within sixty (60)
days after the matter giving rise to the claim becomes finally resolved and
the amount of identifiable Damages can be determined, which second Claim
Notice shall specify the amount of the claim (any such second Claim Notice,
together with any other Claim Notice given pursuant hereto that is not an
Unliquidated Claim Notice is referred to herein as a " _Liquidated Claim
Notice_ "). Each Responsible Party to which a Liquidated Claim Notice that
does not involve a Third Party Claim (as defined below) is given shall
respond to any Indemnified Party that has given such Liquidated Claim Notice
within 30 days (the " _Response Period_ ") after the date on which such
Liquidated Claim Notice is given. If the Responsible Party does not notify

 



54  the Indemnified Party within the Response Period that the Responsible Party
disputes such claim (the " _Claim Dispute Notice_ "), the Responsible Party
shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed with such claim. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Representative may submit a Claim Dispute Notice on
behalf of any or all of the Responsible Parties that are Sellers. If the
Responsible Party has disputed a claim for indemnification (including any
Third Party Claim), the Responsible Party and the Indemnified Party shall
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute. If the
Responsible Party and the Indemnified Party cannot resolve such dispute in 45
days after delivery of the Claim Dispute Notice, the Indemnified Party may
thereafter pursue any legal remedies available to the Indemnified Party
against the Responsible Party with respect to the unresolved claim(s) in
accordance with this  _ARTICLE IX_.

(b) If a claim, action, suit or proceeding by a third party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") is made against any Indemnified Party, and if such Indemnified
Party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under this _ARTICLE IX_ ,
such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Responsible Party of such
claims; _provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the
Responsible Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Responsible Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The Responsible Party shall
have 45 days after receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and control,
through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense
of the Responsible Party, of the settlement or defense thereof, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; provided
that as a condition to the Responsible Partys assumption of the defense of
any Third Party Claim, the Responsible Party shall acknowledge in writing to
the Indemnified Party the Responsible Partys responsibility for such
Third Party Claim; _provided_ further that the Responsible Party shall permit
the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defense through
counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party, provided that, the fees and expenses
of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party. So long as the
Responsible Party is reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any
such claim, provided that in such event it shall waive any right to indemnity
therefor for such claim unless the Responsible Party shall have consented to
such payment or settlement, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. If the Responsible Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
45 days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a claim of
indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the
claim, and the Indemnified Party shall not thereby waive any right to
indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth
in  _Section 9.3(f)_, the Responsible Party shall not, except with the
consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
Person or Persons asserting such claim to all Indemnified Parties of an
unconditional release from all liability with respect to such claim.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, without the written
consent of Parent, the Sellers shall not be entitled to assume any Third
Party Claim to the extent that: (i) any such Third Party Claim seeks, in
addition to or in lieu of monetary damages, any injunctive or other equitable
relief; (ii) the Third Party Claim results from, arises out of or relates
to any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation, or investigation;
(iii) the Third Party Claim involves a material supplier of a Group Company;
(iv) the Third Party Claim results from, 

 



55  arises out of or relates to any civil or criminal or other equitable claim
asserted by any Governmental Entity; or (v) Parent reasonably believes that
Parents Damages resulting from an adverse determination of such Third Party
Claim would be more than an amount equal to two times the amount of the
Sellers indemnification obligations under this _ARTICLE IX_ (after taking
into account other claims for indemnification made by Parent Indemnified
Parties and the limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE IX_ , as applicable)
(each Third Party Claim of the type described in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (v), a " _Prohibited Action_ "). If Parent consents in writing to the
Sellers assumption of any Prohibited Action, the Sellers shall not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such
Prohibited Action, except with the prior written consent of Parent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(d) With respect to Damages to which a Parent Indemnified Party is entitled
hereunder that are based upon fraud, if the amount of the Escrow Funds
available for payment of such Damages is less than the amount of Damages to
which such Parent Indemnified Party is entitled, then, subject to the
limitations contained in this _ARTICLE IX_ , the Parent Indemnified Party
shall have the right to seek payment of such Damages (x) first from the Escrow
Funds to the extent available, and (y) second, directly from Sellers for the
remainder of such Damages in excess of the Escrow Funds. If there shall be a
dispute as to the amount or manner of indemnification under this _ARTICLE IX_
, the Indemnified Party and the Responsible Party may each pursue whatever
legal remedies may be available to enforce its rights under this Agreement.

(e) If the Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnified Party then, within
5 Business Days from the date on which it is finally determined that such
Parent Indemnified Party became entitled to payment under _Section 9.2_,
Parent and the Representative shall provide joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent as to the amount of funds, if any, to be disbursed from the
Escrow Funds and instructions as to the manner in which such funds shall be
disbursed by the Escrow Agent.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall have the
right to conduct and control the defense of the Excluded Liability. Sellers
shall not, except with the consent of Parent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Excluded Liability. After any
full and final settlement of the Excluded Liability, if the Excluded
Liability Holdback is greater than the amount for which the Excluded
Liability was fully and finally settled and all Damages of Parent Indemnified
Parties related to the Excluded Liability then, within 10 Business Days after
such full and final settlement, Parent shall remit to the Escrow Agent the
amount of such excess, to be held in escrow as part of the Escrow Funds. Any
Damages recoverable by a Parent Indemnified Party under _Section 9.2(a)_
shall be paid first from the Excluded Liability Holdback and second, if the
Excluded Liability Holdback is not sufficient to pay the full amount of such
Damages, from the Escrow Funds.

Section 9.4. _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The rights of the
Parent Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 9.2(a)_ are subject to the limitations set forth below.

(a) With respect to claims for Damages by a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant
to  _Section 9.2(a)(i)_, such Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification

 



56  with respect to such Damages only when the aggregate of all Damages to such
Parent Indemnified Party other than Damages recoverable under _Section
9.2(a)(ix)_ exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then such Parent
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification only for its Damages
that are in excess of the Deductible; _provided_ , however, that the
Deductible shall not apply to claims for Damages by a Parent Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ relating to Fundamental Representations
or claims for fraud. The aggregate liability of all of the Sellers, on the one
hand, and Parent, on the other hand, for Damages shall not exceed the Escrow
Amount or be paid from any other source other than the Escrow Funds;
_provided_ , however, that such limitation shall not apply to claims for
fraud.

 

(b) No Seller shall be entitled to contribution from, or indemnification by,
Parent or the Surviving Entity, directly or indirectly, under the Companys
Governing Documents, this Agreement, applicable corporate or other laws or
otherwise, in respect of amounts due from a Seller to a Parent Indemnified
Party under this _ARTICLE IX_ , and Sellers shall hold the Company and the
Parent Indemnified Parties harmless in respect of all such amounts and shall
not seek to join the Company in connection with any suit arising under this
Agreement.

(c) No information or knowledge acquired, or investigations conducted, by
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective representatives or otherwise shall in
any way limit, or constitute a waiver of, or a defense to, any right of a
Parent Indemnified Party to assert a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

(d) All materiality qualifications contained in the Companys or the Sellers
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Document,
including the term Company Material Adverse Effect, shall be taken into
account under this _ARTICLE IX_ solely for purposes of determining whether a
breach or violation has occurred for which an indemnity obligation exists.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to any
representation or warranty that is breached, all such qualifications shall be
ignored and not given effect for purposes of determining the amount of any
Damages resulting from any such breach or violation.

 

(e) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, none of
the Sellers shall be responsible for, and the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to, indemnification with respect to Taxes of a Group
Company for a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, or the portion
of a Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, to the
extent attributable the amount, expiration date, availability of or
limitations on any Group Company Tax attributes, including any net operating
loss, capital loss or credit carryover, and including tax bases of assets, or
the depreciation or amortization thereof, of any Group Company. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 9.4(e)_ shall not in any way be interpreted
as limiting the obligations of Sellers to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to  _Section 9.2(a)(vii)_ for Taxes
of a Group Company for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, or the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

 

Section 9.5. _Exclusive Remedies_. Except as set forth in _Section 6.5_,
_Section 6.13_,  _Section 9.4(a)_ and this _Section 9.5,_ and subject to
_Section 11.15_, (a) the provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy for the parties hereto for any 

 



57  misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or other provision
contained in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Document delivered pursuant
hereto and with respect to any and all claims by Parent Indemnified Parties
relating to this Agreement, the events giving rise to or the subject matter of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; (b) the Escrow Funds
remaining at any given time shall be the sole and exclusive source of payment
and recovery available to the Parent Indemnified Parties under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, this _ARTICLE IX_ ), and at no time will the
Parent Indemnified Parties be entitled to recover Damages or any other
payments hereunder or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(i) in excess of the amount of the Escrow Funds or (ii) from any source other
than the Escrow Funds (including, without limitation, from the
Sellers directly); (c) at such time as there are no remaining Escrow Funds,
the indemnity obligations under _Section 9.2(a)_ and _Section 9.2(b)_ shall
terminate and, other than with respect to fraud, the Sellers and Parent
shall thereafter have no further liability to any Indemnified Party under
this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or
restrict in any manner any rights or remedies that any party has at law or in
equity against any other party hereto, based on fraud.

 

Section 9.6. _Mitigation of Damages_. The parties hereto shall cooperate with
each other to mitigate any Damages. 

Section 9.7. _Calculation of Damages_. In no event shall Damages include
punitive, special, incidental or indirect damages, except to the extent such
damages constitute part of a third partys claim against an Indemnified Party.
The obligation of Sellers to indemnify a Parent Indemnified Party under this
_Article IX_ shall be limited to the amount of any Damages that remain after
deducting therefrom any Recognized Tax Benefit resulting therefrom.

ARTICLE X 

REPRESENTATIVE OF SELLERS

Section 10.1. _Authorization of Representative_.

(a) Each Seller, by virtue of such Sellers execution of this Agreement or
execution and delivery of a Joinder, as the case may be, hereby appoints,
authorizes and empowers BSR LLC to act as such Sellers representative (the "
_Representative_ "), for the benefit of the Sellers, as the exclusive agent
and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each Seller, in connection with and
to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which shall include the power and authority:

(i) to execute and deliver any Ancillary Documents (with such modifications
or changes therein as to which the Representative, in its sole discretion,
shall have consented) and to agree to such amendments or modifications thereto
as the Representative, in its sole discretion, determines to be desirable;

 

(ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as the Representative, in its
sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable;

 



58 (iii) to use the Representative Expense Amount to satisfy costs, expenses
and/or liabilities of the Representative in connection with matters related
to this Agreement and/or the Ancillary Documents, with any balance of the
Representative Expense Amount not used for such purposes to be disbursed and
paid to the Sellers pro rata in accordance with the number of Company Shares
owned by the Sellers at the Closing at such time as the Representative
determines in its sole discretion that no additional such costs, expenses
and/or liabilities shall become due and payable; 

(iv) to collect and receive all moneys and other proceeds and property payable
to the Representative from the Escrow Account as described herein, and,
subject to any applicable withholding retention laws, and net of any out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Representative, the Representative shall
disburse and pay the same to the Sellers pro rata in accordance with
the number of Company Shares owned by the Sellers at the Closing at such time
as the Representative determines in its reasonable discretion;

(v) as the Representative, to enforce and protect the rights and interests of
Sellers and to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the
Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and each other agreement, document,
instrument or certificate referred to herein or therein or the transactions
provided for herein or therein (including in connection with any and all
claims for indemnification brought under _Article IX_ hereof), and to take
any and all actions which the Representative believes are necessary or
appropriate under the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement for and on behalf
of Sellers, including asserting or pursuing any claim, action, proceeding or
investigation (a " _Claim_ ") against Parent, Merger Sub and/or the Surviving
Entity, defending any Third Party Claims or Claims by the Parent Indemnified
Parties, consenting to, compromising or settling any such Claims, conducting
negotiations with Parent, the Surviving Entity and their respective
representatives regarding such Claims, and, in connection therewith, to: (A)
assert any claim or institute any action, proceeding or investigation; (B)
investigate, defend, contest or litigate any claim, action, proceeding or
investigation initiated by Parent, the Surviving Entity or any other Person,
or by any federal, state or local Governmental Entity against the
Representative and/or any of Sellers, the Escrow Funds, and receive process on
behalf of any or all Sellers in any such claim, action, proceeding or
investigation and compromise or settle on such terms as the Representative
shall determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases and discharges
with respect to, any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation; (C) file
any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as the Representative may deem
advisable or necessary; (D) settle or compromise any claims asserted under
the Escrow Agreement; and (E) file and prosecute appeals from any decision,
judgment or award rendered in any such action, proceeding or investigation, it
being understood that the Representative shall not have any obligation to
take any such actions, and shall not have any liability for any failure to
take any such actions;

(vi) to refrain from enforcing any right of any Seller and/or the
Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or
document in connection with the foregoing; provided, however, that no such
failure to act on the part of the Representative, except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement or in the Escrow Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of
any such right or interest by the Representative or by such Seller unless
such waiver is made in accordance with Section 11.10 and in writing signed by
the waiving party or by the Representative; and

 



59 (vii) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Representative, in
its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or
convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents, and all other agreements, documents
or instruments referred to herein or therein or executed in connection
herewith and therewith.

(b) The Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or other
compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall be
entitled to the payment of all its expenses incurred as the Representative. In
connection with this Agreement and any instrument, agreement or document
relating hereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the
powers conferred upon the Representative hereunder (i) the Representative
shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any Seller by reason of any error
in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in
connection with any other agreement, instrument or document delivered pursuant
hereto, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act which
represents willful misconduct, and (ii) the Representative shall be entitled
to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent
experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other
act or omission of the Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no
event subject the Representative to liability to any Seller. Each Seller shall
severally indemnify the Representative against all losses, damages,
liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the amount of
any judgment against them, of any nature whatsoever (including, but not
limited to, any and all expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or
threatened or any claims whatsoever), arising out of or in connection with any
claim, investigation, challenge, action or proceeding or in connection with
any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of the Representative
hereunder or otherwise in its capacity as the Representative. The foregoing
indemnification shall not apply in the event of any action or proceeding which
finally adjudicates the liability of the Representative hereunder for its
willful misconduct. In the event of any indemnification hereunder, upon
written notice from the Representative to Sellers as to the existence of a
deficiency toward the payment of any such indemnification amount, each Seller
shall promptly deliver to the Representative full payment of his or her
ratable share of the amount of such deficiency.

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or any
termination of this Agreement and/or the Ancillary Documents.

 

(d) Parent and the Surviving Entity shall have the right to rely upon all
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Representative pursuant to this
Agreement, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally binding upon
Sellers.

 



60 (e) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Seller, and (ii) shall survive the consummation of the
Merger.

Section 10.2. _Successor Representative; Removal_.

(a) If any Representative resigns (by giving at least 60 days written notice
of such resignation to Parent and the Escrow Agent) or dies or becomes
incapable of continuing to act as the Representative for any reason, a
successor Representative (who shall either be a Seller or another Person
reasonably acceptable to Parent) shall be appointed in writing by a majority
in interest of the Sellers, such appointment to become effective upon the
delivery of executed counterparts of such writing to Parent, the Surviving
Entity and the Escrow Agent, together with an acknowledgement signed by the
successor Representative named in such writing that he, she or it accepts the
responsibility of successor Representative and agrees to perform and be bound
by all provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement applicable to
the Representative. Failing such appointment, the Escrow Agent or any Seller
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor Representative. 

(b) A majority in interest of the Sellers shall have the right at any time
during the term of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement to remove the then-
acting Representative and to appoint a successor Representative (who shall
either be a Seller or another Person reasonably acceptable to Parent);
_provided_ , however, that such removal of the then-acting Representative
shall not be effective until the delivery to Parent, the Surviving Entity and
the Escrow Agent of executed counterparts of a writing signed by a majority in
interest of the Sellers with respect to such removal and
appointment, together with an acknowledgement signed by the successor
Representative appointed in such writing that he, she or it accepts the
responsibility of successor Representative and agrees to perform and be bound
by all of the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
applicable to the Representative.

(c) Each interim and successor Representative shall have all the power,
authority, rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the original
Representative, and the term Representative as used herein shall be deemed to
include any interim or successor Representative.

 

(d) Any notices given by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Escrow Agent
while there is no Representative shall be sufficiently given if given to the
other, with a copy provided directly to the Seller with the largest stake in
the Escrow Funds immediately following the Effective Time (excluding the
former Representative). A copy of all such notices shall be delivered to the
successor Representative upon his, her or its appointment and he, she or it
shall have five (5) days thereafter to take such actions as may be required
under the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement in connection with
any such notice.

Section 11.3. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claims arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of
law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

 

Section 11.4. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, whether or not the Closing occurs or the Merger is consummated,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the fees and

63  shall be paid by the party hereto incurring such fees or expenses;
_provided_ that in the event that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay
all Unpaid Sellers Expenses as part of the Purchase Price in accordance with
_Section 2.9_.

 

Section 11.5. _Construction; Interpretation_. The term "this Agreement" means
this Agreement and Plan of Merger together with all Schedules and Exhibits
hereto, as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented
or restated in accordance with the terms hereof. The headings contained in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. No party hereto, nor its
respective counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for purposes
of construing or enforcing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this
Agreement shall be construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly
for or against any party, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise
favoring or disfavoring any Person by virtue of its authorship of
any provision of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary
herein by the context or use thereof: (i) the words, "herein," "hereto,"
"hereof" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole,
including the Schedules and Exhibits, and not to any particular section,
subsection, paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement;
(ii) masculine gender shall also include the feminine and neutral genders, and
vice versa; (iii) words importing the singular shall also include the plural,
and vice versa; (iv) the words "include," "includes" or "including" shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation"; (v) the word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if";
and (vi) the phrase "ordinary course of business" shall mean the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice.

 

Section 11.6. _Exhibits and Schedules_. All Exhibits and Schedules or other
documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full in
this Agreement. Any item disclosed on any Schedule referenced by a particular
section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to every other section in this Agreement if the applicability of such
disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent. The specification of
any dollar amount in the representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule is not
intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use
the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in
any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not
described herein or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes
of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.7. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in _Section 6.5_, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the stockholders and
optionholders of the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing are third
party beneficiaries of _ARTICLE X_ of this Agreement.

  



64 Section 11.8. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of
this Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and
valid under applicable law, but if any term or other provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable
law, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 11.9. _Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable
law (including the DGCL) and _Section 11.10_, this Agreement may be amended
or modified only in accordance with _Section 6.10_ (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, only applies to amendments of the Schedules) or by a written
agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company. After the Effective Time, subject to applicable law
(including the DGCL), this Agreement may be amended or modified only by
written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of the
Surviving Entity and the Representative. This Agreement may not be modified
or amended except as provided in the immediately preceding two sentences and
any purported amendment by any party or parties hereto effected in a manner
which does not comply with this _Section 11.9_ shall be void. 

Section 11.10. _Extension; Waiver_. The Company, on behalf of itself and
Sellers (at any time prior to the Closing), and the Representative, on behalf
of itself and Sellers (at any time after the Closing), may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Entity contained herein, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub contained herein or
in any document, certificate or writing delivered by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Entity pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Entity with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Parent may, at any time, (i) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the Company (prior to the Closing),
Sellers or the Representative contained herein, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the Company (prior to the Closing) and
Sellers contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
by the Company (prior to the Closing), Sellers or the Representative pursuant
hereto or (iii) waive compliance by the Company (prior to the Closing),
Sellers or the Representative with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. Any waiver of any term or condition
shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent
waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or
condition of this Agreement. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of
its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 11.11. _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 



65 Section 11.12. _Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. The obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder are jointly and severally guaranteed by
each other.

Section 11.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. The parties to this Agreement each
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to trial by
jury of any claim, demand, action, or cause of action (i) arising under this
Agreement or (ii) in any way connected with or related or incidental to the
dealings of the parties hereto in respect of this Agreement or any of the
transactions related hereto, in each case whether now existing or hereafter
arising, and whether in contract, tort, equity, or otherwise. The parties to
this Agreement each hereby agrees and consents that any such claim, demand,
action, or cause of action shall be decided by court trial without a jury and
that the parties to this Agreement may file an original counterpart of a copy
of this Agreement with any court as written evidence of the consent of the
parties hereto to the waiver of their right to trial by jury.

Section 11.14. _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the parties hereto submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State
of Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may
be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other
court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety or other security that might be required of any other party
with respect thereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of summons and
complaint or any other process that might be served in any action or
proceeding may be made on such party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address of the party and in the
manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 11.2_. Nothing in this
_Section 11.14_, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by law. Each party hereto agrees that a
final, non-appealable judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law.

 

Section 11.15. _Remedies_.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, may occur in the
event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, prior
to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_ , the
Company, the Representative, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the
Company, any Seller, Parent or Merger Sub is entitled at law or in equity.

 



66 (b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that (i) there
is adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party hereto seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

 

Section 11.16. _Guarantee_. ARAMARK Corp. hereby absolutely, irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees to the Company and the Sellers the obligation of
Parent to pay the Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.
