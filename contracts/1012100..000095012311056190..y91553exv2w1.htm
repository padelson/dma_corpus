AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 31, 2011 (this " _Agreement_ "), is by and among Sealed Air Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Soap_ "), Diversey Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Dish_ "), and Solution Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Soap (" _Merger Sub_ "). Capitalized terms used herein are defined in _Article IX_. 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Soap and Dish have determined that it is consistent with and in furtherance of their respective long-term business strategies and fair to and in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders to combine their respective businesses as set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Soap, Dish and Merger Sub have unanimously approved this Agreement and declared it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to Soaps willingness to enter into this Agreement, CMH and CDandR are executing a written agreement, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto (the " _Dish Stockholder Letter_ "), in which, among other things, they are consenting to and adopting this Agreement and approving the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder, which consent is the only approval of holders of Dish Common Stock necessary to approve the Merger and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Dishs willingness to enter into this Agreement, on or prior to the Closing, certain Dish Stockholders and Soap will enter into a registration rights agreement (the " _Registration Rights Agreement_ ") in substantially the form as _Exhibit C_ hereto, to provide certain liquidity terms with respect to the shares of Soap Common Stock Dish Stockholders will receive in the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged (the " _Merger_ ") with and into Dish in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and Dish shall be the surviving corporation (the " _Dish Surviving Corporation_ "). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) At the Closing, Dish and Merger Sub shall file a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_ ") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as Soap and Dish may agree and is specified in the certificate of merger). 

  

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Dish Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, Liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of Dish and Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of _Article VI_, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the third Business Day after the date the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (excluding conditions that by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), the Closing shall occur on the date following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the earlier to occur of (a) a date during the Marketing Period to be specified by Soap on no less than two Business Days notice to Dish and (b) the final day of the Marketing Period (the date on which the Closing occurs pursuant to this _Section 1.2_, the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Dish Surviving Corporation_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Dish shall be amended and restated so as to read in its entirety in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Dish shall be amended and restated so as to read in their entirety in the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers of Dish Surviving Corporation_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Dish Surviving Corporation and the officers of Dish at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Dish Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. 

   ##### 

  

  

Article II 

   

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

  

 Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time: 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.1(b)_ and _Section 2.2_, each share of Dish Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (and (i) each share of Dish Common Stock that the holders of the Unilever Warrant are entitled to receive upon exercise of the Unilever Warrant and (ii) each phantom share of Dish Common Stock set forth on _Section 2.1(a)_ of the Dish Disclosure Letter) shall be converted into the right to receive the Dish Per Share Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Dish Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Dish Per Share Merger Consideration. 

  

 (b) Each share of Dish Common Stock held by Dish as treasury stock (other than Dish Common Stock in a Dish Benefit Plan) or owned by Soap or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Dish Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Dish Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.1(a)_, shares of Dish Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Dish Stockholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented to the Merger in writing and who has demanded appraisal for those shares in accordance with the DGCL shall not be converted into a right to receive the Dish Per Share Merger Consideration, unless the holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, the holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, those shares of Dish Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Dish Per Share Merger Consideration. Dish shall give Soap prompt notice of any demands received by Dish for appraisal of shares of Dish Common Stock, and Soap shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to those demands. Except with the prior written consent of Soap, or to the extent required by applicable Law, Dish shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any demands. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to amend or waive any obligation of any Dish Stockholder who has waived or limited the right to assert appraisal rights in a separate agreement or in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.3 _Dish Options and Deferred Stock Units_.  

  

 (a) _Dish Deferred Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each right to receive one share of Dish Common Stock (or the value of one share of Dish Common Stock, i.e., a phantom share) granted by Dish pursuant to any Dish DSU Plan (each, a " _Dish Share Unit_ ") 

   ##### 

  

 

that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, become a vested right (except for those Dish Share Units
identified in Section 2.3(a) of the Dish Disclosure Letter, which rights
shall not be vested as of the Effective Time) to receive the Dish Per DSU
Cash Merger Consideration, subject, in each case, to the terms of the
applicable Dish Share Unit agreements including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any provisions regarding date of payment (and vesting, if applicable) of the
Dish Per DSU Cash Merger Consideration contained therein;  _provided_ ,
however, that in no event shall any Dish Share Unit that becomes vested prior
to the Effective Time be settled until the Effective Time, unless settlement
is required earlier in order to avoid taxation under Section 409A of the
Code. 

   

 (b) _Dish Options and Dish SARs_. 

   

 (i) _Vested Dish Options_. 

   

 (1) At the Effective Time, each Dish Option that is vested as of the date hereof (any such Dish Option, a " _Vested Dish Option_ ") shall be cancelled, and each holder of Vested Dish Options shall receive the payments provided for by  _Section 2.3(b)(i)(2)_. 

   

 (2) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of Vested Dish Options shall receive, in consideration for the cancellation of such Vested Dish Option, the Dish Per Vested Option Consideration. 

   

 (ii) _Unvested Dish Options and Post-Agreement Vested Dish Options_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement: 

   

 (1) Upon the Effective Time, Soap shall assume each Unvested Dish Option, Post-Agreement Vested Option and Dish SAR, which shall be converted automatically into a cash-settled stock appreciation right covering a number of shares of Soap Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares (or phantom shares, in the case of Dish SARs) of Dish Class B Stock subject to the Unvested Dish Option, Post-Agreement Vested Option or Dish SAR, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Dish Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per Share of such Unvested Dish Option, Post-Agreement Vested Option or Dish SAR, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Dish Exchange Ratio (the " _Assumed Dish Awards_ "). Except as specifically provided in this _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_, following the Effective Time, if applicable, each Assumed Dish Award shall continue to have such rights and terms as are required under Section 7.2 of the Dish Equity Plan, the Dish Trading (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. Phantom Stock Incentive Plan or the Dish South Africa (Pty) Limited Phantom Stock Plan, as applicable. The foregoing conversion shall be determined and interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (2) Dish shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions necessary with respect to the Dish Equity Plan, the Dish Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan, Dish South Africa (Pty) Limited Phantom Stock Plan and the Dish Trading (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. Phantom Stock Incentive Plan and any other similar plan, as applicable, to allow for the treatment of the Dish Options and Dish SARs described herein. 

 

All amounts payable under this _Section 2.3_ shall be paid net of
applicable withholding and payroll Taxes. 

   

 Section 2.4 _Exchange of and Payment for Securities_. 

  

 (a) At the Closing or, if later, upon surrender by each Dish Stockholder to Soap for cancellation of certificates, in the case of certificated shares (the " _Certificates_ "), representing such Dish Stockholders shares of Dish Common Stock or transfer to Soap by each Dish Stockholder, subject to the receipt by Soap of an "agents message" (or any other evidence of transfer as Soap may reasonably request), of uncertificated shares, in the case of uncertificated shares (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), representing such Dish Stockholders shares of Dish Common Stock, Soap shall issue to each Dish Stockholder the shares of Soap Common Stock constituting the Dish Per Share Stock Consideration and the Dish Per Share Cash Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares as provided in this _Section 2.4_. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Dish Per Share Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.6_. The shares of Soap Common Stock constituting the Dish Per Share Stock Consideration, at Soaps option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is otherwise required under applicable Law. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Dish Per Share Merger Consideration. 

  

 (b) To the extent any shares of Dish Common Stock are not surrendered at Closing pursuant to  _Section 2.4(a)_, promptly after the Effective Time, Soap shall send to each holder of Dish Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to Soap) for use in such exchange. Each holder of shares of Dish Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Dish Per Share Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to Soap of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by Soap (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as Soap may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Dish Per Share Merger Consideration payable for each share of Dish Common Stock represented by a Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. If any portion of the Dish Per Share Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (A) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to Soap any transfer or other Taxes required as a result 

   ##### 

  

 

of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of Soap
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (c) All Dish Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, respectively, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Dish Common Stock.

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Soap shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Dish Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amount remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Dish Common Stock two years after the Effective Time (or that earlier date, immediately prior to the time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Soap, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Soap Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered shares of Dish Common Stock with respect to shares of Soap Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such shares of Dish Common Stock until such holder shall surrender such shares of Dish Common Stock in accordance with this _Article II_. After the surrender of any such shares of Dish Common Stock in accordance with this _Article II_, such holder thereof entitled to receive shares of Soap Common Stock shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, with a record date after the Effective Time and which theretofore had become payable with respect to whole shares of Soap Common Stock issuable to such holder in respect of such shares of Dish Common Stock. 

  

 Section 2.5 _Dish Transaction Expenses_. Dish shall provide a written schedule to Soap two Business Days prior to Closing, setting forth in reasonable detail (including amounts) the Dish Transaction Expenses. Soap will have an opportunity to review and discuss any comments with Dish, and Dish and Soap shall cooperate to address any such comments. 

  

 Section 2.6 _No Fractional Shares of Soap Common Stock_. No fractional shares of Soap Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Soap Common Stock that a holder of shares of Dish Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from this aggregation, the holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash, without interest, determined by multiplying the fractional share by the closing price of Soap Common Stock on the trading day immediately following the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to those former holders of Dish Common Stock in lieu of any fractional interests, Soap shall distribute those amounts to those former holders of Dish Common Stock.

 Section 2.7 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a change in the number of shares of Soap Common Stock or Dish Common Stock by reason of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, stock dividend, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, Soap Common Stock or Dish Common Stock (other than the Merger contemplated hereunder), the Dish Per Share Merger Consideration and the Dish Per DSU Cash Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Dish Common Stock, Vested Dish Options or Dish Share Units the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 Section 2.9 _Withholding Rights_.

At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Soap and the Dish Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Soap or Merger Sub or the Dish Surviving Corporation or Dish, as applicable any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Soap or Merger Sub or the Dish Surviving Corporation or Dish, as applicable, any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in Soap or the Dish Surviving Corporation, as applicable, any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by Soap or the Dish Surviving Corporation, as applicable, as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Each of the Soap SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act as in effect on the date so filed. There are no outstanding comments from the SEC with respect to any Soap SEC Document. None of the Soap SEC Documents contained, when filed or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each filing that will be made by Soap with the SEC after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, when filed with the SEC, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and will not, when filed with the SEC, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 (b) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Soap (including, in each case, any related notes thereto) included in the Soap SEC Documents have been prepared, in each case, in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be

the consolidated financial position of Soap and the Soap Subsidiaries (as
applicable) at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated statements
of operations, cash flows and stockholders equity for the periods indicated
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments). 

   

 (c) Since January 1, 2009, Soap and the Soap Subsidiaries have maintained systems of internal control over financial reporting (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Soap has designed and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by Soap in its periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to Soaps management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Soap required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Soap has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date of this Agreement, to Soaps auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Soap (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Soaps ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Soaps internal controls over financial reporting, and has made available to Dish copies of any such material disclosure made by management since January 1, 2009.

 Section 4.16 _Financing: Solvency_. 

   

 (a) _Section 4.16_ of the Soap Disclosure Letter sets forth complete and accurate copies of the executed commitment letter, with term sheets and annexes and the related fee letters with respect thereto (provided that the amount of fees and certain other economic terms may be redacted from the fee letters) (collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ ") from Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (collectively, the " _Lenders_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Soap (or directly to Dish or one of Dishs Subsidiaries) for the purpose of funding the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Financing_ "). Except as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent to the respective obligations of the Lenders to fund the Financing. The fee letters do not contain any conditions precedent to the respective obligations of the Lenders to fund the Financing. There are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements that would 

   ##### 

  

 

permit the Lenders to reduce the amount of the Financing or that would
otherwise affect the availability of the Financing. Each of the Debt
Commitment Letters has been duly executed and delivered by, and is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Soap, and to the Knowledge of Soap, all other
parties thereto. Each of the Debt Commitment Letters is in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or
modified in any respect, except as permitted by this _Section 4.16_ or
_Section 5.17_. All commitment and other fees required to be paid under the
Debt Commitment Letters on or prior to the date hereof have been paid and, as
of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Soap, there is no fact or occurrence
existing that would make any of the statements (including assumptions) set
forth in any of the Debt Commitment Letters inaccurate. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions in _Section 6.1_ and  _Section 6.2_ and no
breach or default by Dish hereunder, to the Knowledge of Soap, there is no
fact or occurrence as of the date hereof that would cause the conditions to
funding of the Financing not to be satisfied at or before the Closing, and
Soap has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the
Debt Commitment Letters. 

   

 (b) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ , on or before the Business Day next succeeding the last day of the Marketing Period, Soap will have, (i) sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds to consummate all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the payment of the Dish Per Share Merger Consideration and the Dish Per DSU Cash Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, the repayment or refinancing of the Indebtedness set forth in _Section 3.17(a)(ii)_ of the Dish Disclosure Letter, and the payment of any fees or expenses associated with any of the foregoing, and (ii) the resources and capabilities (financial and otherwise) to perform its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Soap is not entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Soap or any of its Subsidiaries, or Dish or any Dish Subsidiary. Immediately after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the aggregate Dish Per Share Merger Consideration and the Dish Per DSU Cash Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, the repayment or refinancing of the Indebtedness set forth in  _Section 3.17(a)(ii)_ of the Dish Disclosure Letter, and the payment of any fees or expenses associated with any of the foregoing, assuming (i) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Soaps obligation to consummate the Merger as set forth herein and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Dish set forth in _Article III_ hereof as of the Closing Date, Soap and its Subsidiaries will be Solvent. For purposes of this _Section 4.16_, the term " _Solvent_ " with respect to Soap and its Subsidiaries means that, as of any date of determination, (A) the amount of the fair saleable value of the assets of Soap and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such date, the sum of (1) the value of all Liabilities of Soap and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other Liabilities, as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with the applicable federal Laws governing determinations of the solvency of debtors, and (2) the amount that will be required to pay the probable Liabilities of Soap and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on their existing debts (including contingent Liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; (B) Soap and its Subsidiaries will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the business in which they are engaged or proposed to be engaged by 

   ##### 

  

 

Soap following such date; and (C) Soap and its Subsidiaries will be able to
pay their Liabilities, including contingent and other Liabilities, as they
mature. 

   

 Section 4.17 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Soap for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act (or, with respect to any post-effective amendment or supplement, at the time such post-effective amendment or supplement becomes effective), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Resale Registration Statement will, at the time the Resale Registration Statement is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act (or, with respect to any post-effective amendment or supplement, at the time such post-effective amendment or supplement becomes effective), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Registration Statement and the Resale Registration Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. No representation or warranty is made by Soap with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Dish for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement or the Resale Registration Statement. 

  

 Section 4.18 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and warranties contained in this  _Article IV_, none of Soap and the Merger Sub, nor any Soap Subsidiary nor any other Person acting on behalf of Soap, the Merger Sub or any such Soap Subsidiary, makes any representation or warranty, express or implied.

 (a) Soap shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the issuance of the shares of Soap Common Stock to Dish Stockholders pursuant to the Merger to be effected in compliance with Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act (or another applicable exemption from registration thereunder) and in accordance with all applicable blue sky or similar state securities laws and Dish shall cooperate with Soap in such issuance. 

  

 (b) If at any time either Soap or Dish determines in good faith that it is not possible to cause the issuance of the shares of Soap Common Stock to the Dish Stockholders pursuant to the Merger to be effected in compliance with Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act (or another applicable exemption from registration thereunder) (the " _Registration_

shall instead prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-4 with respect to the issuance of Soap Common Stock in the Merger (such
Form S-4, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Registration
Statement_ "). Dish shall cooperate with Soap in its preparation of
appropriate offering materials or preparation of the Registration Statement,
as the case may be; without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Dish
will furnish to Soap the information relating to Dish as is required by the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Registration
Statement, other offering materials or other state blue sky filings. Soap
shall provide Dish with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
other offering materials or on the Registration Statement, as applicable,
prior to their dissemination or filing with the SEC and Soap shall include
such reasonable comments thereon as are proposed by Dish or its counsel. 

   

 (c) In the event of a Registration Statement Decision, Soap shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after the date such determination is made, and Soap shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective until such date as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Exchange Act and applicable state securities Laws. Soap shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide Dish with copies of any written comments, and advise Dish of any oral comments, with respect to the Registration Statement received from the SEC.

 (d) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Soap shall make all other filings required to be made by it with respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and applicable state securities Laws. 

  

 (e) In the event of a Registration Statement Decision, Soap shall advise Dish, promptly after it receives notice, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of Soap Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Registration Statement. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Soap, Dish or any of their respective Affiliates is discovered by Soap or Dish that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the party discovering this information shall promptly notify the other party and, to the extent required by Law, Soap shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause an appropriate amendment or supplement describing this information to be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law. 

 

 Section 5.4 _Access to Information; Cooperation_. Each of Dish and Soap shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance 

      ##### 

  

    

notice during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of their
respective properties, offices, books, personnel and records, and, during
this period, shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to,
furnish reasonably promptly to the other party all information (financial or
otherwise) concerning their respective businesses as such party may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Dish nor Soap
shall be required by this  _Section 5.4_ to provide the other party or its
Representatives with (a) access to its properties or those of any of its
Subsidiaries for the purpose of invasive physical testing; (b) any
information that it reasonably believes it may not provide by reason of
applicable Law or the provisions of any Contract to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party; or (c) any information protected by attorney/client

 Section 5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Third Party Consents_. 

  

 (a) Subject to _Section 5.5(d)_, each of Dish and Soap shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain or make all necessary or appropriate filings (including those under the HSR Act, EU Merger Regulation and the other filings required under the Competition Laws of the jurisdictions set forth on _Section 5.5(a)_ of the Dish Disclosure Letter) required under applicable Law and to lift any injunction or other legal bar to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement.

 (b) Each of Soap and Dish shall (i) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all inquiries and requests received from any other Governmental Authority in connection with Competition Law matters, and (ii) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC or the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other party. 

  

 (c) In addition, each of Soap and Dish shall, subject to applicable Law and except as prohibited by any applicable representative of any applicable Governmental Authority, (i) promptly notify and apprise the other party of (and, if in writing, supply the other party with) any communication (or other correspondence or other memoranda) to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Authority, and, permit the other party to review in advance, and accept all of the other partys reasonable comments in connection with, any proposed written communication to any of the foregoing; (ii) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion or communication with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings (excluding the initial filings under the HSR Act), and written communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Each of Soap and Dish shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement and to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party to this Agreement shall (i) cooperate fully with the other parties hereto, shall execute and deliver such further documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and shall take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by any other party hereto to evidence or reflect the Merger (including the execution and delivery of all documents, certificates, agreements and instruments reasonably necessary for all filings hereunder); (ii) give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain each approval, consent, ratification, permission, waiver or authorization required to be obtained by such party in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Soap shall take any and all action necessary, including but not limited to (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of Soap, Dish or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of Soap, Dish or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations of Soap, Dish or their respective Subsidiaries, or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of Soap, Dish or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate 

   ##### 

  

 

applications with any Governmental Authority in connection with any of the
foregoing and, in the case of actions by or with respect to Dish or its
Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets, by consenting to such
action by Dish and provided, that any such action may be conditioned upon
consummation of the Merger) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ "), to ensure that
no Governmental Authority enters any Order, or establishes any Law, rule,
regulation or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining,
enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or to ensure that no
Governmental Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or
otherwise approve the consummation of the Merger fails to do so by the
Outside Date. In the event that any action is threatened or instituted
challenging the Merger as violative of any Law, Soap shall take all action
necessary, including but not limited to any Divestiture Action, to avoid or
resolve such action. In the event that any permanent or preliminary
injunction or other Order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be
entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the Merger in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain,
enjoin or otherwise prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation
of the Merger, Soap shall take promptly any and all steps necessary to
vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or Order so as to permit such
consummation prior to the Outside Date. Dish shall cooperate with Soap and
shall use reasonable best efforts to assist Soap in resisting and reducing
any Divestiture Action, and Dish shall not, except with the express written
consent of Soap, propose, offer, suggest or negotiate any Divestiture Action
with any Governmental Authority. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to
share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any applicable
privilege. If any Divestiture Action agreed to by Soap requires action by or
with respect to Dish or the Dish Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets, and such action would constitute a breach of Section 5.1 of this
Agreement, Soap hereby agrees to consent to the taking of such action by Dish
and any such action may, at the discretion of Dish, be conditioned upon
consummation of the Transactions. 

   

 Section 5.6 _No Solicitation_. From the date hereof until the Closing, Dish shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of the Dish Subsidiaries or its, or its Subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisers to, directly or indirectly, (a) take any action to solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (b) engage in any substantive discussions or negotiations with, furnish any nonpublic information relating to Dish or any of the Dish Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, assets, books or records of Dish or any of the Dish Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal or a modification of a previously received Acquisition Proposal, (c) enter into any agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (d) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 Section 5.7 _Tax Matters_.

   ##### 

  

 

and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than any such Taxes that
are solely the responsibility of the holders of Dish Common Stock under
applicable Law (together, with any related interest, penalties or additions
to Tax, " _Transfer and Gains Taxes_ "). From and after the Effective Time,
Soap shall pay or cause to be paid all Transfer and Gains Taxes (other than
any such Taxes that are solely the responsibility of the holders of Dish
Common Stock under applicable Law) without deductions withheld from the Dish
Per Share Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) At or prior to Closing, either (i) Dish shall have delivered to Soap a duly executed non-USRPI certificate, as described in Treasury Regulation § 1.1445-2(c), or (ii) the Dish Stockholders and the holders of the Unilever Warrant shall have delivered to Soap duly executed non-foreign certificates, as described in Treasury Regulation § 1.1445-2(b), in each case in compliance with Section 1445 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations, certifying such facts as to establish an exemption from withholding, failing which Soap shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a Dish Stockholder or a holder of the Unilever Warrant pursuant to this Agreement as provided in _Section 2.9_. 

  

 (c) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the parties agree to cooperate in good faith to determine whether and to what extent the actions described in _Section 5.7(c)_ of the Soap Disclosure Letter (" _Section 5.7(c) Actions_") are appropriate and advisable, taking into account all the facts and circumstances; provided, however, that (i) in the event this Agreement is terminated, Soap will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Dish and Dish Subsidiaries for any current and future losses, third-party costs and expense resulting from any Section 5.7(c) Action undertaken at Soaps request, as well as the third-party costs of investigating any Section 5.7(c) Action whether or not ultimately undertaken, (ii) in no event will any losses, costs and expenses associated with investigating or enacting any Section 5.7(c) Action be considered Dish Transaction Expenses, and (iii) no such Section 5.7(c) Action shall be undertaken unless Dish and Soap mutually agree that such action is appropriate and advisable. 

  

 (d) Dish shall consult with Soap in connection with the preparation of Dishs U.S. federal income tax return for Dishs tax year ended December 31, 2010 (the "Dish 2010 Return") and provide to Soap a draft copy (subject to completion) of the Dish 2010 Return no later than ten (10) business days prior to the due date for filing the Dish 2010 Return. Subject to Section 5.1(l), Dish shall retain all authority with respect to the final form of the Dish 2010 Return; provided, however, that Dish agrees to consider in good faith any comments Soap may have with respect to the Dish 2010 Return. 

 

 Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a release mutually agreed to by Dish and Soap. Thereafter, Dish and Soap shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any press release or make any public statement or filing relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement or filing as may be required by Law or the 

     ##### 

  

    

applicable rules of any stock exchange if it has used its reasonable efforts
to consult with the other party and to obtain that partys consent but has
been unable to do so prior to the time the press release or public statement
or filing is required to be released, filed or furnished pursuant to such
Law. 

   

 Section 5.9 _Employee Arrangements_. 

  

 (a) All employees of Dish and any Dish Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become employees of the Dish Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time. Any such employee that remains employed by the Dish Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate thereof for any time thereafter shall be a " _Continued Employee_ ". During the period beginning on the Closing and ending on December 31, 2012, Soap shall, or shall cause the Dish Surviving Corporation to, provide to each Continued Employee, for so long as the Continued Employee remains so employed during such period, base salary or wages and an annual target cash bonus opportunity level that are no less favorable than the base salary or wages and annual target cash bonus opportunity level (other than equity-based incentive compensation) provided to such employee prior to the Closing. During the period beginning on the Closing and ending on December 31, 2012, Soap shall, or shall cause the Dish Surviving Corporation to, provide to each Continued Employee, for so long as the Continued Employee remains so employed, the level of welfare and retirement benefits provided to such employee prior to the Closing, until such time as Soap instead provides such Continued Employee the level of welfare and retirement benefits provided to a similarly situated employee of Soap or its Subsidiaries (which for the avoidance of doubt may not occur on the same date(s)). Prior to the Effective Time, Dish shall take, or cause to be taken, the actions described in  _Section 5.9(a)_ of the Dish Disclosure Letter. 

  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Soap shall, or shall cause the Dish Surviving Corporation to, provide each Continued Employee whose employment is terminated effective as of any date following the Closing and prior to December 31, 2012 with severance payments and benefits equal to the greater of (i) severance payments and benefits to which such employee would have been entitled with respect to such termination under the Dish Benefit Plans set forth in  _Section 5.9(b)_ of the Dish Disclosure Letter as applicable to each relevant Continuing Employee (or to the extent mandated by applicable Law, any such statutorily mandated severance payments and benefits) or (ii) the severance payments and benefits that would be provided to a similarly situated employee of Soap or its Subsidiaries with respect to such termination under the severance policies, programs, plans and arrangements of Soap and its Subsidiaries in effect as of the time of such termination. 

  

 (c) From and following the Effective Time, Soap shall honor or cause to be honored and assumed (and shall not challenge the validity of), in accordance with their terms, all incentive, bonus, individual benefit, employment, employment termination, severance and other compensation agreements, plans and arrangements, in each case existing immediately prior to the Effective Time that are between Dish or any Dish Subsidiary and any current or former officer, director or employee thereof or for the benefit of any such current or former officer, director or employee (except that Soap reserves the right to terminate or amend any Dish Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by the terms of any such Dish Benefit Plan). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Soap shall, or shall cause the Dish Surviving Corporation to, give Continued Employees full credit for such Continued Employees service with Dish and any Dish Subsidiary for all purposes, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accruals and determination of the level of benefits (including, for purposes of vacation and severance), under any benefit plan in which a Continued Employee participates on or following the Closing to the same extent recognized by Dish or any Dish Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. 

  

 (e) Soap shall, or shall cause the Dish Surviving Corporation, to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Continued Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan providing health benefits in which Continued Employees participate following the Closing, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees as of the Closing under the analogous Dish Benefit Plan, (ii) give credit for any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Continued Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Closing during the portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans in which they are eligible to participate after the Closing in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred and (iii) waive any waiting period or evidence of insurability requirement otherwise applicable to a Continued Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing, in each case to the extent such Continued Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Dish Benefit Plan prior to the Closing. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Soap shall cause the Dish Surviving Corporation to or cause the Dish Subsidiaries to, honor the terms and conditions of any and all collective bargaining agreements, contracts or other agreements with a labor union, labor organization, works council or group of employees of Dish or any Dish Subsidiary to which Dish or any Dish Subsidiary is a party or by which Dish or any Dish Subsidiary is bound. 

  

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.9_ or otherwise in this Agreement, Soap shall not, and shall cause Dish and all Dish Subsidiaries or Soap not to, amend or terminate any plan, program, policy or arrangement that provides for retiree health or welfare benefits described in Item 19 of the Dish Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2010, filed with the Dish Form 10-K filed on March 17, 2011 (the " _Retiree Plans_ "), with respect to any individual who retired under any such Retiree Plan prior to June, 2004 or who was eligible to retire under any such Retiree Plan prior to June, 2004. 

  

 (h) The provisions of _Section 5.9_ above are for the sole benefit of Soap and Dish and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any Dish Employees), other than Soap and Dish and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in _Section 5.9_ above) under

From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Dish shall (a) provide to Soap a monthly management report in scope and detail consistent with those management reports that have been historically prepared by Dish and (b) timely prepare, and promptly deliver to Soap, monthly financial statements, to be in scope and detail consistent with the monthly financial statements that have been historically prepared by Dish. 

  

 Section 5.11 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Soap shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of Dish or any of the Dish Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, Liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of Dish or any Dish Subsidiary, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date hereof by Dish pursuant to the Dish Certificate of Incorporation, the Dish Bylaws and indemnification agreements with any directors or officers of Dish and the Dish Subsidiaries that have been made available to Soap prior to the date hereof and that are listed on Section 5.11 of the Dish Disclosure Letter. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Dish Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses that are no less favorable than those set forth in the Dish Certificate of Incorporation and the Dish Bylaws on the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Indemnified Parties thereunder. 

  

 (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Soap shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Dish (provided that Soap may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Soap shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the premiums paid as of the date hereof by Dish for such insurance as set forth on Section 5.11 of the Dish Disclosure Letter (" _Dish s Current Premium_"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 300% of Dishs Current Premium, then Soap shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in Soaps good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of Dishs Current Premium. At Dishs option, in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Dish may purchase prior to the 

   ##### 

  

 

Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail policy" providing at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the insured as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by Dish with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time.
If such tail policy has been obtained by Dish prior to the Effective Time,
Soap shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for
its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Dish
Surviving Corporation. If Dish does not elect to purchase such a "tail
policy", Soap may, after the Effective Time and in lieu of the foregoing
insurance coverage, purchase a six year "tail policy" providing at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no
less advantageous to the insured as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by Dish with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) Soap shall pay (as incurred) all expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Person may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this _Section 5.11_, _provided_ , that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. 

  

 (d) If Soap or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Soap, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.11_. 

  

 (e) The provisions of this _Section 5.11_ (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 

  

 Section 5.12 _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of Dish and Soap shall promptly notify the other after receiving or becoming aware of any matter (including a breach of covenant or a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement) that results or would reasonably be expected to result in, to the non-satisfaction of any of the conditions to Closing in _Article VI_. 

  

 Section 5.13 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Soap shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause, prior to the Closing, (i) the shares of Soap Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and (ii) the shares of Soap Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon the exercise of any Soap options or equity awards, to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. 

  

 Section 5.14 _Resale Registration Statement_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing, Soap shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC and cause to become effective a registration statement under the 

   ##### 

  

 

Securities Act on Form S-3 (or any successor short form registration
statement involving a similar amount of disclosure) (the " _Resale
Registration Statement_ "), providing for the offer and resale of the shares
of Soap Common Stock to be received by the holders of Dish Common Stock and
Vested Dish Options in the Merger, on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415
of the Securities Act, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Registration Rights Agreement. 

   

 (b) Dish shall cooperate with Soap in its preparation of the Resale Registration Statement; without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Dish shall furnish to Soap the information relating to Dish, the Dish Stockholders, the number of shares of Soap Common Stock to be received and the intended method of distribution of such shares as is required to be set forth in the Resale Registration Statement. 

  

 Section 5.15 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Dish and Soap and the respective members of their boards of directors shall, to the extent permitted by Law, use reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and to take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise to take all such other actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

additional conditions or otherwise expand upon the conditions precedent to

or delay the funding of the Financing or the consummation of the Merger and

impact the ability of Soap to enforce its rights against other parties to the

Soap shall promptly deliver to Dish copies of any such amendment,
replacement, supplement, modification or waiver. In the event that any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the
sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters for any reason, (A) Soap
shall promptly notify Dish and (B) Soap shall use its reasonable best efforts
to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources, on terms that
are not materially adverse to Soap, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, including entering into definitive agreements with

first or second sentence of this _Section 5.17(b)_ being referred to as
the " _Financing Agreements_ "). Soap shall use the bridge facility (if any)
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as necessary to cause the Closing

conditions). Soap shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to, comply with the terms, and satisfy on a timely basis
the conditions, of the Debt Commitment Letters, any alternative

other economic terms may be redacted), (y) give Dish prompt notice (1) of
any material breach by any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters, any
alternative financing commitment or the Financing Agreements of which Soap

source, with respect to (A) any actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letters, any
alternative financing commitment or the Financing Agreements of any
provisions of the Debt Commitment Letters, any alternative financing
commitment or the Financing Agreements or (B) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letters, any alternative
financing commitment or the Financing Agreements with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded
at Closing or (3) if at any time for any reason Soap believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters, any alternative financing commitment or the
Financing Agreements and (z) otherwise keep Dish reasonably informed of the
status of Soaps efforts to arrange the Financing (or any replacement
thereof). As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two
Business Days of the date Dish delivers to Soap a written request, Soap shall
provide any information reasonably requested by Dish relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (y) of the immediately preceding
sentence.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Dish nor any of the Dish Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the Financing (or any replacements thereof) prior to the Effective Time for which it is not reimbursed or indemnified by Soap.
