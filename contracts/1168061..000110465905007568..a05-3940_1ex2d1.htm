 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

  



  

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of this 20th day of February 2005, by and among Novartis Corporation,
a New York corporation (" _Novartis_ "), Zodnas Acquisition Corp., an
indirect, wholly owned Subsidiary of Novartis (" _Merger Sub_ "), Eon Labs,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ") and, for purposes of Section
10.12 only, Novartis AG, a Swiss Company (" _Parent_ ").

  



  

 _W_ _I_   _T_ _N_ _E_   _S_ _S_ _E_   _T_ _H_ :

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Novartis and Merger Sub, have
each unanimously approved the acquisition of the Company on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Novartis is
entering into an Agreement for Purchase and Sale of Stock (the " _Santo
Agreement_ ") by and among Novartis, Santo Holding (Deutschland) GmbH ("
_Santo_ "), and Novartis AG whereby Novartis is agreeing to purchase, and
Santo is agreeing to sell, all of the 60,000,000 (sixty million) shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") owned by Santo (the " _Santo Shares_ ", such transaction, the "
_Santo Purchase_ "), representing approximately 67.5% of the total amount of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein;

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, Novartis and Merger Sub have agreed that
(i) Merger Sub will commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock other than the Santo Shares
(the " _Public Shares_ "), at a price per share of U.S. $31.00 (thirty one
U.S. dollars) net to the seller in cash (the " _Offer Price_ ") upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (ii) if
Merger Sub acquires the Requisite Tender Amount (as defined below) pursuant
to the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the
Company being the surviving corporation, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement (the merger of Merger Sub into the
Company being referred to in this Agreement as the " _Merger_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company and a special committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company consisting of independent directors not
affiliated with Santo (the " _Special Committee_ ") (i) have approved the
Offer, (ii) have determined that the Offer, the Merger (as defined herein)
and the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders other than Santo, (iii) have
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) are
recommending that the Companys stockholders other than Santo accept the
Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock to Merger Sub in the Offer
and adopt this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, Novartis, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and to prescribe certain conditions to the Offer and the
Merger;

  

   

     
   

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I 
  
  _THE OFFER_

  



  

1.1 _The Offer_.

  



  

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article IX hereof, within 10 (ten) Business Days following the date
hereof (or such later date as the parties may mutually agree), Merger Sub
will commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (including the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) an offer to purchase any and all
outstanding Public Shares at the Offer Price, shall file a Schedule TO and
all other necessary documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") and make all deliveries, mailings and telephonic notices
required by Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, in each case in connection
with the Offer (such documents filed with the SEC and such other deliveries,
mailings and notices, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and shall use reasonable
best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof.  Novartis will cause Merger Sub to accept for payment or pay for
any Public Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, subject only to (1)
the contemporaneous (or immediately subsequent) purchase of the Santo
Shares pursuant to the Santo Agreement and (2) all of the requirements of Law
for consummating the Offer (the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "). " _Law_ "
shall mean any applicable United States or foreign, federal, state or local
law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction,
decree, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental Entity. "
_Governmental Entity_ " shall mean any United States or foreign federal,
state or local governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body
or other governmental entity. " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day that is
not a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which banks are required or
authorized by Law to be closed in The City of New York.

  



  

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Company by action of the Special
Committee, Merger Sub shall not decrease the Offer Price or change the form
of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number of Public Shares
sought to be purchased in the Offer, impose additional conditions to the
Offer or amend any other term of the Offer in any manner adverse to the
holders of Public Shares, except as provided in this Agreement. The Offer
shall remain open until the date that is 20 (twenty) business days (as such
term is defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the
commencement of the Offer (the " _Expiration Date_ "), unless Novartis shall
have extended the period of time for which the Offer is open pursuant to, and
in accordance with, the two succeeding sentences or as may be required by
applicable Law, in which event the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the
latest time and date as the Offer, as so extended, may expire; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Novartis may provide for a subsequent offering period after
the Expiration Date, in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act
(including the obligation that Merger Sub accept and promptly pay for any
Public Shares tendered during such subsequent offering period). If, at any
Expiration Date, any of the Tender

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

Offer Conditions are not satisfied or waived by Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall
extend the Offer from time to time, each such extension not to exceed such
number of days that Merger Sub reasonably believes are necessary to cause the
Tender Offer Conditions to be satisfied (but in any event not more than
30 Business Days per extension unless the parties shall otherwise mutually
agree),  _provided_ , that at an Expiration Date, if all of the Tender Offer
Conditions have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub may extend the Offer for
a period of time not to exceed 10 (ten) Business Days on one occasion in
order to obtain the Requisite Tender Amount (as defined below) of tendered
shares (if at least 40% of the Public Shares have been tendered and not
withdrawn at that Expiration Date) and on one occasion in order to satisfy
the requirements necessary to effect a subsequent merger without a meeting of
stockholders as contemplated by Section 3.5 (if the number of Public Shares
tendered and not withdrawn at that Expiration Date together with other
Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub and Novartis or to be acquired under
the Santo Agreement would constitute at least 80% of the Company Common
Stock). Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the
satisfaction of all the Tender Offer Conditions as of any Expiration Date,
Novartis will cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for any and all
Public Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer at the earliest time after such Expiration Date, regardless of the
number of Public Shares tendered in the Offer (such date as Merger Sub shall
be obligated to accept for payment any and all Public Shares validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, the " _Acceptance Date_ ").
On the Acceptance Date, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of February
11, 2005, by and between Novartis and the Company (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") shall be amended such that the fifth paragraph thereof shall
permit Novartis and Merger Sub to make acquisitions of Public Shares that are
voluntary to the holders of Public Shares (such as by means of legally
permissible open market purchases or tender offers), but shall not permit
Novartis to cause a merger transaction (or other business combination) to be
effected which would cancel Public Shares unless (i) a majority of the
outstanding Public Shares vote in favor of such a transaction or (ii)
Novartis and its Subsidiaries shall, at that time, own at least 90% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock; _provided_ , that the consideration to be
received by the holders of Public Shares in any such transaction described in
(ii) above shall be at least equal to the Offer Price per Public Share.

  



  

(c) Novartis and Merger Sub represent that the Offer Documents will comply in
all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal and state
securities laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first
published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders, shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except that no representation is made by either Novartis or
Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by the Company in writing for
inclusion in the Offer Documents. Each of Novartis and Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to
the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect and Merger Sub further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to stockholders of the Company, in each case, as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents in advance of their filing with the SEC or dissemination to
stockholders of the Company.  Novartis shall provide to the Company

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

and its counsel in writing any comments Novartis, Merger Sub or their counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of such comments.

(a) The Company shall, after affording Novartis a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, file with the SEC and mail to the holders of
Company Common Stock, as promptly as practicable on the date of the filing by
Novartis and Merger Sub of the Offer Documents, a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on _Schedule 14D-9_ (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") reflecting the recommendation of the
Companys Board of Directors and the Special Committee that holders of Public
Shares tender their shares of Company Common Stock into the Offer, and shall
disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 as required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under
the Exchange Act. The Schedule 14D-9 will set forth, and the Company hereby
represents, that the Companys Board of Directors and the Special Committee,
at a meeting duly called at which a quorum was present throughout, have (i)
determined by unanimous vote **** of all its members **** that each of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including each of the Offer and the Merger,
is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders
other than Santo, (ii) approved the Santo Purchase, the Offer and the Merger
and this Agreement in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law ("
_DGCL_ "), (iii) recommended acceptance and approval of the Offer and
adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, and (iv) taken all
other action within the Board of Directors and the Special Committees power
to render Section 203 of the DGCL, if applicable, inapplicable to the
Santo Purchase, the Offer and the Merger, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Novartis and Merger Sub agree that such recommendations may be modified or
withdrawn after the date hereof if, but only if, after consultation with its
outside counsel, the Special Committee determines that doing so is required
in the proper exercise of its fiduciary duties. The Company further
represents that, prior to the execution hereof, Merrill Lynch and Co. ("
_Merrill Lynch_ ") has delivered to the Special Committee its written opinion
that, as of the date of this Agreement, the consideration to be received by
the holders of Public Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to
such stockholders from a financial point of view. The Company hereby consents
to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendations of the Special
Committee described in this Section 1.2(a).

  



  

(b) The Company represents that the Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all
material respects with the provisions of applicable federal and state
securities laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first
published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders, shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company with respect
to information supplied by Novartis or Merger Sub in writing for inclusion in
the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Novartis and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
stockholders of the Company, in each case, as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws.

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

The Company shall provide to Novartis and its counsel in writing any comments
the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments.

  



  

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company will promptly furnish Merger
Sub with mailing labels, security position listings, any available non-
objecting beneficial owner lists and any available listing or computer list
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Company
Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date and shall furnish Merger
Sub with such additional available information (including, but not limited
to, updated lists of holders of the Company Common Stock and their addresses,
mailing labels and lists of security positions and non-objecting beneficial
owner lists) and such other assistance as Merger Sub or its agents may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the Companys record and
beneficial stockholders. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Novartis, Merger Sub
and their Affiliates, associates, agents and advisors shall keep such
information confidential and use the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files only in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and, should the Offer terminate or if this Agreement shall be terminated,
will destroy all copies of such information then in their possession,
_provided_ , that Novartis, Merger Sub and their Affiliates, associates,
agents and advisors may keep one copy of such information in the office of
their general counsel solely for the purpose of preserving the record of the
materials received and using the same to defend against any claims or actions
threatened or instituted involving such information. Novartis, Merger Sub
and their Affiliates, associates, agents and advisors may retain
all analyses, compilations, studies or other documents or records prepared by
them, which contain or otherwise reflect or are generated from such
information.

  



  

1.3 _Directors._

  



  

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, from and after the Acceptance
Date, Novartis shall be entitled to designate each member of the Companys
Board of Directors, and the Company shall promptly take all actions necessary
to cause Novartis designees to be so elected, including, if necessary,
seeking the resignations of one or more existing directors and prior to the
Acceptance Date removing any potential restrictions on the ability of any
Novartis designees to serve on the Companys Board of Directors; _provided_
, that if Novartis and the Company shall have purchased in the Offer
(including any subsequent offering period) the Requisite Tender Amount, then
until the Effective Time, Novartis and Merger Sub shall allow the members of
the Special Committee or their designees who shall be deemed the "Special
Committee" for all purposes of this Agreement, to remain on the Companys
Board of Directors _provided_ , that if both of the members of the Special
Committee shall be unable or unwilling to remain on the Companys Board of
Directors and neither shall have designated a replacement, Novartis shall be
permitted to replace such members with other independent directors who shall
be deemed the "Special Committee" for all purposes of this Agreement;
_provided_ , __ however, __ that such independent directors designated by
Novartis shall not have the authority to reduce the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Novartis designees to the Companys
Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to
such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.3 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to
the Company and its officers and directors as is required under such Section
and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3.
 Novartis will supply to the Company any information with respect to itself
and its nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by such Section
and Rule.

2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate

shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate
existence of the Company with all of its rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set

if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing this
Agreement or a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as is required
by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the
date and time that the Merger becomes effective in accordance with applicable
Law being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

2.3 _Certificate of Incorporation_.  At the Effective Time, and without any
further action on the part of the Company or Merger Sub, subject to Section
7.9, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended in its entirety to read the
same as the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (the "
_Certificate of Incorporation_ ").

  



  

2.4 _By-Laws_. At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the
part of the Company or Merger Sub, subject to Section 7.9, the by-laws of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
amended in its entirety to read the same as the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _By-Laws_ "), until thereafter amended as provided
therein, in the Certificate of Incorporation or in accordance with applicable
Law.

  



  

2.5 _Directors_. Subject to requirements of applicable Law, the directors of

6

ARTICLE III 
  
  _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates_

  



  

3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.  At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company, Novartis,
Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company,
Novartis or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (which will be owned
by Novartis) and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Novartis-Owned Stock._ Each share
of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company directly as treasury
stock or by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than in a representative
or fiduciary capacity) shall automatically be retired and shall cease to
be outstanding, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. As used in this Agreement, " _Subsidiary_ " when used
with respect to any party hereto, means any entity of which such party (a)
owns 50% or more of the outstanding securities or other ownership interests,
or (b) through contract or otherwise possesses power to appoint at least 50%
of the directors of such entity (or Persons performing similar functions).

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 3.3, each issued
and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company
Common Stock to be retired in accordance with Section 3.1(b)), shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive, upon the surrender of such certificates (for each share
of Company Common Stock represented thereby), the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(d) _Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock under any employee stock option or
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (a " _Company Option_
"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option be
cancelled and the holder thereof will receive as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time a cash payment with respect thereto
equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of such Company Option and (b) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company
Option (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time, all
Company Options shall no

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder
of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment. Prior to the
Acceptance Date the Company shall take any and all actions necessary to
effectuate this Section 3.1(d).

  



  

3.2 _Exchange of Share Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Novartis shall designate a
paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the
" _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration or other
payment to which holders of Company Options shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 3.1. Prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, Novartis shall deposit with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates and Company
Options, cash equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding (and not to be retired pursuant to Section 3.1(b))
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Outstanding
Shares_ ") _multiplied by_ (B) the Merger Consideration, plus an amount equal
to (Y) the sum of the Option Cash Payments. The deposit made by Novartis,
pursuant to this Section 3.2(a) is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_."  The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held
for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and holders of Company
Options and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments provided for
in Section 3.1. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is
not expressly provided for in this Agreement. If the Paying Agent
invests the Exchange Fund, the Paying Agent shall only invest the Exchange
Fund in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, Novartis shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal specifying
that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent,
such letter of transmittal to be in customary form and have such other
provisions as Novartis may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration (such instructions shall include instructions for the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered on the transfer books of the
Company, subject to the receipt of appropriate documentation for such
transfer). Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or evidence
of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
this Article III, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled; _provided_ that in no event will a holder of a Certificate be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration if Merger Consideration was
already paid with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock underlying
such Certificate in connection with an affidavit of loss. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be issued to
such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Company
Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer, and the Person requesting such
issuance pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establishes to the satisfaction of Novartis and the Company that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

  



  

For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit corporations), general or
limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature.

  



  

(c) _Transfers._ After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund relating
to the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of
the Company or holders of Company Options 180 (one hundred and eighty) days
after the Effective Time shall be returned to Novartis or the
Surviving Corporation. Any stockholders of the Company or holders of Company
Options who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall
thereafter look only to Novartis for payment of the Merger Consideration upon
due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof),
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Novartis, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock or
holder of Company Options for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Novartis, the posting by such
Person of a bond reasonably satisfactory to Novartis as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of the Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Novartis, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article III
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under provision of any federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. If Novartis, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Company Common Stock in respect of which Novartis, Paying Agent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

3.3 _Dissenters  Rights_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in any other Section of this Agreement to the
contrary, Company Common Stock, outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such
shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_
") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise
loses his right to appraisal.  At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, subject to and net
of any applicable withholding of Taxes, payment of the appraised value of
such Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to receive, subject to
and net of any applicable withholding of Taxes, payment of the appraised
value of such Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the
manner provided in Section 3.2, of the Certificate or Certificates that
formerly evidenced such Dissenting Shares.

  



  

(b) The Company shall give Novartis prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served on or otherwise received by the Company pursuant to the
DGCL, and Novartis shall have the right to participate in and control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL.  The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Novartis, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

  



  

3.4 _Stockholders  Meeting._

  



  

(a) If required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance with
applicable Law:

  



  

(i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") as soon as practicable following the
Acceptance Date for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this
Agreement;

  



  

(ii) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement or
information statement relating to this Agreement and any other required
filings, and use its reasonable efforts (x) to obtain and furnish the
information required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement (as
hereinafter defined) and, after consultation with Novartis, to respond
promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary
proxy statement and cause a definitive proxy or information statement (the

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

" _Proxy Statement_ ") and any other required documents to be mailed to its
stockholders and (y) to obtain the necessary approvals of the Merger and this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by its stockholders; and

  



  

(iii) subject to the proviso in the second sentence of Section 1.2(a),
include, if required, in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the
Companys Board of Directors and the Special Committee that the stockholders
of the Company adopt this Agreement.

  



  

3.5 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_.  Notwithstanding Section 3.4,
but subject to Article VIII hereof, in the event that Novartis, Merger Sub or
any other Subsidiary of Novartis shall acquire at least 90% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock following the purchase of the Santo Shares
and the completion of the Offer, the parties hereto agree to take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as practicable after the acceptance for payment of and payment for
Company Common Stock by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

  



  

ARTICLE IV 
  
  _The Closing_

  



  

4.1 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
(i) at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street,
New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the second Business
Day after the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) shall be satisfied or waived (by the party entitled to the
benefit of such condition) in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) at such
other place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and Novartis
may agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").

  



  

ARTICLE V 
  
  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

  



  

5.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the section of the disclosure schedules delivered to Novartis by the Company
on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Schedule_ ") that corresponds with the applicable subsection of Section 5.1,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Novartis and Merger Sub that:

  



  

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction
of organization. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction where the

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

ownership or operation of its properties and assets or conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be
so qualified or be in good standing that would not be reasonably likely,
either individually or in the aggregate, to have Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Novartis complete and
correct copies of the Companys and each of its Subsidiaries certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (or comparable governing instruments). The
certificate of incorporation and by-laws or comparable governing instruments
(" _Organizational Documents_ ") of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
so made available are in full force and effect.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Affiliate_ " shall mean, with respect
to any Person, any other Person directly or indirectly controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with, such Person; _provided_ , that,
for the purposes of this definition, "control" (including, with correlative
meanings, the terms "controlled by" and "under common control with"), as used
with respect to any Person, shall mean the possession, directly
or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of such Person, whether through the ownership of
voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "
means a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),
business, assets, liabilities or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than (i) any effect resulting from
events, facts or circumstances relating to the economy in general, including
market fluctuations and changes in interest rates, or to the Companys
industry in general and not specifically relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, other than any such effects that disproportionately impact
the Company and its Subsidiaries (ii) any effect resulting from changes in
legal or regulatory conditions that affect in general the business in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries are engaged, other than any such effects
that disproportionately impact the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) the
impact of this Agreement, the announcement or performance of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the impact of this
Agreement on relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors or
employees).

  



  

(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
105,000,000 (one hundred and five million) shares, consisting of
(i) 100,000,000 (one hundred million) shares of Company Common Stock, of
which 88,832,664 shares are outstanding as of the date hereof, and (ii)
5,000,000 (five million) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share
(" _Preferred Stock_ "), none of which are outstanding as of the date hereof.
Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of each
of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and is owned by the Company or a direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, pledge, claim,
option, charge, security interest, limitation, encumbrance and restriction of
any kind (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of such capital stock of other ownership interests). Other than
with respect to the Subsidiaries listed on Section 5.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not directly or indirectly own any
securities or other beneficial ownership interests in any other entity
(including through joint ventures or partnership arrangements), or have any
investment in any other Person. Other than options to purchase up to
4,737,980 shares of Company Common Shares at an average price of $12.69 per
share pursuant to the Companys 2001 Stock Option Plan and the Companys 2003
Stock Incentive Plan, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights,
options, warrants,

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any kind to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries are bound, obligating the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered
or sold, any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to
subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or aware of any voting or other
shareholders agreement with respect to its securities or the securities of
any of its Subsidiaries. Other than as set forth in Section 5.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are not any outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire or to file any registration statement with respect to
any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Company, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for such breaches,
conflicts, violations, defaults, accelerations, creations or changes that
would not be reasonably likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, impair or materially delay
the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

(e) _The Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(i) The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed with the SEC all registration
statements, prospectuses, forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed by them since May 24, 2002 under the Exchange
Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ")
(collectively, the " _Company Reports_ "). The Company Reports, including any
financial statements or schedules included in the Company Reports, at the
time filed (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements,
on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively, and, in
the case of any Company Report amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such amending or superseding
filing) (i) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, and (ii) complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act,
as the case may be. The financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries included in the Company Reports (i) have been prepared from, and
are in accordance with, the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) at the time filed (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of mailing, respectively, and, in the case of any Company
Report amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement,
then on the date of such amending or superseding filing) complied as to form
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (iii) were
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _U.S. GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto, or, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and (iv) fairly
present in all material respects (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments) the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
(and changes in financial position, if any) for the periods then ended.

(ii) With respect to each Annual Report on Form 10-K and each Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q included in the Company Reports filed since January 1,
2003, the financial statements and other financial information included in
such reports fairly present (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal, recurring audit adjustments) in all material respects the financial
condition and results of operations of the Company as of, and for, the
periods presented in the Company Report. Since August 29, 2002, the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board of Directors (i) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Companys internal controls over financial reporting and the Company has
provided to Novartis copies of any written materials relating to the
foregoing. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act);
such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared; and, to the knowledge of the Company, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Companys
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in the Companys periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding loans made by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined
in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company. Since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, neither the Company nor any of

Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

liabilities or obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any
kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined or
otherwise.

their business only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction,
entered into any material agreement or made any material commitment other
than according to, the Companys ordinary and usual course of such business,
and (i) there has not been any Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action referred
to in Section 6.1 except as permitted hereby.

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

(h) _Litigation_. There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, hearings, investigations, reviews, inquiries or proceedings
pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that would not be reasonably
likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or to prevent, impair or materially delay the ability of the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except
as disclosed in the Company Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree which, individually or in the

financial point of view.

set forth herein and a majority of the Public Shares having been purchased in
the Offer (the " _Requisite Tender Amount_ "). This condition set forth in
this Section 8.1(a) shall be waivable only with the approval of the
Special Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Offer can not be
completed (on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein) as a
result of the failure to satisfy a requirement of Law in connection
therewith, but the Merger is capable of consummation in compliance with the
requirements of Law, then the parties shall, subject to Section 8.1(b),
proceed with the consummation of the Merger, subject in such circumstances to
the additional condition that the Merger be approved at the Special Meeting
by a majority of the Public Shares; _provided_ that if the Merger is
not approved by a majority of the Public Shares at such Special Meeting,
this Agreement shall automatically terminate and the date of such Special
Meeting shall be deemed to be the Acceptance Date for purposes of the last
sentence of Section 1.1(b).

  



  

(b) No court or Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, Law,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, injunction or other order that
is in effect or taken any other action enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or has the effect of making the
purchase of Company Common Stock illegal.

  



  

ARTICLE IX 
  
  _Termination_

  



  

9.1 _Termination by Mutual Consent_.  This Agreement may be terminated and
the Offer and the Merger contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Effective Time, by mutual written consent of the Company and
Novartis.

  



  

9.2 _Termination Upon Termination of the Santo Agreement_.  This Agreement
shall automatically terminate and the Offer, if outstanding, shall be
abandoned, upon the termination of the Santo Agreement if at the time of such
termination, no Santo Shares shall have been purchased by Novartis or its
Affiliates.

  



  

9.3 _Termination Upon Completion of Offer Without Requisite Tender Amount_.
This Agreement shall terminate if, following the completion of the Offer and
the acceptance for payment or payment for any Public Shares tendered pursuant
to the Offer, Novartis or its Affiliates shall not have purchased the
Requisite Tender Amount.  For the avoidance of doubt, such termination shall
be without prejudice to the Companys obligations set forth in Section 1.3.

  



  

9.4 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. In the event of termination of
this Agreement and the abandonment of the Offer and the Merger pursuant to
this Article IX, this Agreement (other than as set forth in Section 10.1)
shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party
hereto or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (or of any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other
representatives); _provided, however_ , that except as otherwise provided
herein, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability
resulting from any breach of this Agreement.

(for the avoidance of doubt, other than Parent) hereby irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, (i) any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to laying venue of any suit, action or proceeding brought in
such courts, and (ii) any claim that any suit, action or proceeding brought
in such courts has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

10.7 _Entire Agreement; No Other Representations_.  This Agreement
(including any annexes, schedules and exhibits hereto), the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Novartis Disclosure Schedule and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement by and among the
parties hereto and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties, both written and oral, among the parties,
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

10.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Other than with respect to the matters
set forth in Section 7.9 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers
Insurance), this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

  



  

10.9 _Severability._   The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the

  



  

26   

     
   

  



  

other provisions hereof. Upon any determination that any term or other
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

  



  

10.10 _Interpretation_. The table of contents and headings herein are for
convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement
and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section,
such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated.  Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The parties hereto each acknowledge that each party
has participated in the drafting of and been represented by counsel in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Accordingly, any rule of Law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in any portions of this Agreement
against the party that drafted it has no application and is expressly waived.

  



  

10.11 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
Law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Novartis may designate,
by written notice to the Company, another Subsidiary of Novartis to be
a constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, whereupon all references
herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary,
except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to
Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations
and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of
such designation.

  



  

10.12 _Parent Guarantee_.  Whenever in this Agreement performance of or
compliance with a covenant or obligation is expressed to be required by
Novartis or Merger Sub, Parent shall cause Novartis or Merger Sub to perform
or comply with such covenant or obligation, such that any failure of Novartis
or Merger Sub to perform or comply with any such covenant or obligation shall
be deemed to be a breach of such covenant or obligation by Parent.

  



  

27   

     
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed, acknowledged and
delivered by the duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the
date first written above.
