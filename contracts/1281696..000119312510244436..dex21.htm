-iii-  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 28, 2010 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and among sanofi-aventis, a French _soci ete anonyme_ ("
_Parent_ "), Star 2010, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and BMP Sunstone Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
are sometimes referred to individually in this Agreement as a " _Party_ " and
collectively as the " _Parties_."

_W I T N E S S E T H:_

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Merger Sub and the Company have
approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Merger Sub and the Company have
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger in accordance
with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, Parent and Merger Sub have approved this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and all of the covenants and agreements contained
in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parents willingness to enter into
this Agreement and incur the obligations set forth herein, Parent and certain
stockholders of the Company which beneficially or of record own an aggregate
of approximately 23% of the Shares (as defined below) on a fully diluted basis
(the " _Stockholders_ ") have entered into a stockholder support agreement
(the " _Support Agreement_ ") relating to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement
and incur the obligations set forth herein, Les R. Baledge has,
contemporaneously herewith, executed a Letter of Undertaking, substantially in
the form attached hereto as Appendix 1\.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
company in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.

 



\- 1 -  1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, 1701 Market Street,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be
specified by the Parties (the " _Closing Date_ ") which shall be no later
than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law (as defined in Section 3.7(a))) of the conditions
set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied by action at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
written waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and time as
the Company and Parent may agree in writing. As used in this Agreement, "
_Business Day_ " shall mean any day on which the principal offices of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") in Washington, D.C. are
open to accept filings. 

1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, immediately after the Closing, the
Parties shall (i) cause the Merger to be consummated by executing and filing
a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware in such form as is required by, and executed
in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and (ii) make all
other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
at such later time as the Parties shall agree and as shall be set forth in the
Certificate of Merger (such time as the Merger becomes effective is referred
to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation, all as provided under the DGCL.

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.
Subject to Section 5.10 of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the restated
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Company, in each case, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.

 

1.6 _Officers and Directors_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date shall,
to the extent they have entered into Retention Agreements (as defined in
Section 5.15), be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall
hold office until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 



\- 2 -  ARTICLE 2 

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

2.1 _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of
any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.1(d) and
Section 2.1(e), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such shares collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ " or "
_Shares_ " and each, a " _Share_ "), other than any Cancelled Shares (as
defined, and to the extent provided in, Section 2.1(b)) and any Dissenting
Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided in, Section 2.1(e)), shall
thereupon be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive the sum of $10.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been thus converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and the holders of
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Shares (" _Certificates_ ") or holders of Shares represented by book entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in
accordance with this Article 2.

(b) _Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly
or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
or held by the Company as treasury stock (in each case, other than any such
Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common
stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number
of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(d)  _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

 



\- 3 -  (e) _Dissenting Shares_. (i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, no Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, the holder of which (A) has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing, (B) has demanded its rights to
appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, and (C) has not
effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to appraisal (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), shall be converted into or represent a right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a). By virtue of the Merger, all
Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall
represent the right to receive only those rights provided under the DGCL.
From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of a member or
equity owner of the Surviving Corporation or of a stockholder of Parent.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.1(e), if any holder of
Shares who demands dissenters rights shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent or its rights
of appraisal, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence
of such event, such holders Shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and
shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 

(iii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written demands
for dissenters rights of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
which relate to any such demand for dissenters rights and (B) the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for dissenters rights under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for dissenters rights or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be
appointed to act as a paying agent hereunder and approved in advance by the
Company in writing (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Shares, the Company Stock Options (as defined in Section
5.5(a)(i)) and the Company Stock-Based Awards (as defined in Section
5.5(a)(ii)), cash sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration in
exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares), payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article
2 and (ii) the Option and Stock-Based Consideration (as defined in Section
5.5(a)(ii)) payable pursuant to Section 5.5 (such cash referred to in Sections
2.2(a)(i) and 2.2(a)(ii) being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ").

 



\- 4 -  (b) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify), and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. On the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall also
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Company Stock Option or
a Company Stock-Based Award by wire transfer the amount due and payable to
such holder pursuant to Section 5.5 hereof in respect of such Company Stock
Option or Company Stock-Based Award.

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with, in the
case of Certificates, such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message," and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the product of (A) the number
of Shares represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied
by (B) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If the
payment equal to the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Book-
Entry Shares is registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall be
a condition of payment that (i) the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
proper endorsements or documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and (ii) the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any
applicable stock transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment
to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or provide evidence satisfactory to the Paying Agent that any stock
transfer Taxes (as defined in Section 3.13(c)) have been paid or are not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article 2.

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any former holder of
Shares or former holder of Company Stock Options or Company Stock-
Based Awards, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment, including any applicable transfer, stamp or other Taxes due as
a result of the consummation of the Merger. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld or deducted and paid over to the

 



\- 5 -   applicable Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.3(b)), such withheld
or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the former holder of the Shares or holder of the Company
Stock Options or Company Stock-Based Awards, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding were made.

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the day of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent
for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for a check in the proper
amount pursuant to this Article 2.

(d)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Stock-Based
Awards for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have
not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their
Shares.

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
(as defined in Section 8.12(a)) or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to such
date on which any Merger Consideration payable to the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to this Article 2 would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, and any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore complied
with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,

procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in
which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being
prepared. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting in

Companys periodic and current reports required under the Exchange Act.

recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement,
to the Companys outside auditors and audit committee of the board of
directors of the Company (i) significant deficiencies and material weaknesses

aggregate, are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys

 



\- 12 -   ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and

employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls. The
Company has made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement a
summary of any such disclosure made by management to the Companys auditors
and audit committee since January 1, 2007.

Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and

certifications are complete and correct. For purposes of this Agreement,

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract or arrangement (including any Contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the

affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K)), where the
result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract or arrangement is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the Companys consolidated
financial statements or Company SEC Documents.

reserved against in the Companys consolidated balance sheets (or the notes

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this
Section 3.6, the term "liabilities" shall not include obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to perform under or comply with any Law,
action, judgment or contract (in each case, other than an obligation to pay
money) but would include such obligations if there has been a default or
failure to perform or comply by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
any such obligation if such default or failure would, with the giving of
notice or passage of time or both, reasonably be expected to result in a
monetary obligation.

anything contained in this Section 3.7(a), no representation or warranty

referenced in Section 3.5 or in respect of environmental matters.

to own, lease, occupy and operate their properties and assets or to carry on
their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "),
except where the failure to have any of the Company Permits has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are in full force and

the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such payee in his official
capacity, inducing such payee to do or omit to do any act in violation of his

dates. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, except as would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge
of the Company, there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in
connection with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject
to any liability under the terms of such Company Benefit Plan or under

benefit or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement
or as required by applicable Law, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee,
consultant or officer, except as expressly provided in this Agreement or (iii)

States Law (a " _Foreign Benefit Plan_ "), (i) all employer and employee
contributions to each Foreign Benefit Plan required by Law or by the terms of
such Foreign Benefit Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued in

to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
and (ii) each Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered has
been registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
regulatory authorities, except for such failures to register or maintain as

liability under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other
than liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
arising in the ordinary course) and no fact or event exists that could result
in the incurrence by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of such liability.

(i) Each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to the requirements of Section
409A of the Code has been operated in good faith compliance with the currently
applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations,
rulings and notices thereunder and the Company has made or will make a good
faith attempt to amend such Company Benefit Plans to the extent necessary to
meet the documentary compliance standards thereof in a timely manner.

information in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain or with respect to,
any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to constitute, a
Company Alternative Proposal, or in response to any inquiries or proposals
that may reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Alternative Proposal,
except to notify such person as to the existence of the provisions of this
Section 5.3, (iii) agree to approve, endorse or recommend any Company
Alternative Proposal, (iv) authorize or permit any of its or its Subsidiaries
Representatives to take any such action or (v) enter into any letter of intent
or similar document or any agreement or commitment providing for any Company
Alternative Proposal (except as contemplated by Section 7.1(f) and except for
confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 5.3(b)). Subject
to Section 5.3(b), the Company shall not release any third party from, or
waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which
it is a party. The Company shall, and shall cause its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any parties that may have been
conducted heretofore with respect to a Company Alternative Proposal, (ii) with
respect to third parties with whom discussions or negotiations have been
terminated on, prior to or subsequent to the date of this Agreement, use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the return or destruction of, in accordance
with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement, confidential
information previously furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or
their Representatives and (iii) cause any virtual or physical data room to no
longer be accessible to or by any person other than Parent and its
affiliates.

(b) The Company will promptly notify Parent orally (and then in writing within
twenty-four (24) hours) after it or any of its Subsidiaries has received any
proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any amendment thereto) relating to or
constituting a Company Alternative Proposal, any request for discussions or
negotiations, or any request for information relating to the Company or the
Subsidiaries in connection with a Company Alternative Proposal or a potential
Company Alternative Proposal or for access to the properties or books and
records thereof of which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives is or become aware, or any amendments to the
foregoing. Such notice to Parent shall indicate the identity of the person
making such proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any amendment thereto)
and the terms and conditions of

 



\- 36 -   the foregoing, if any. The Company shall also promptly provide Parent with
(i) a copy of any written notice or other written communication from any
person informing the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives that it is considering making, or has made a proposal
regarding, a Company Alternative Proposal, (ii) a copy of any Company
Alternative Proposal (or any amendment thereof) received by the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries, and (iii) such other details of any such Company
Alternative Proposal that Parent may reasonably request. Thereafter, the
Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) keep
Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of any change to the terms of
any such Company Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding the limitations set
forth in Section 5.3(a) and subject to compliance with this Section 5.3(b),
if the Company receives a Company Alternative Proposal (that did not arise or
result from any breach of this Section 5.3) (i) which constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 5.3(g)) or (ii) which the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, could reasonably be
expected to result, after the taking of any of the actions referred to
in clause (x), (y) or (z) below, in a Company Superior Proposal, the Company
may take any or all of the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic
information to the third party (and any persons working in concert with such
third party and to their respective potential financing sources and
Representatives) making any such Company Alternative Proposal, if, and only
if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the
third party an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable
to the Company than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, (y) engage in
discussions or negotiations with the third party (and such other persons) with
respect to the Company Alternative Proposal and (z) release any third party
from, or waive any provision of, a confidentiality or standstill provision to
which it is a party if, in the case of this clause (z), the board of directors
of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that such action is necessary under applicable Law in order for
the directors to comply with their fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders.

 

(c) In response to the receipt of a Company Alternative Proposal (that did not
arise or result from a breach of this Section 5.3) that has not been
withdrawn, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the board of directors of the Company may change, withhold or withdraw the
Company Recommendation (as defined in Section 5.4(c)) (a " _Company Change of
Recommendation_ ") but only if the board of directors of the Company has
concluded in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x) such Company Alternative
Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (y) effecting a Company
Change of Recommendation is required for the board of directors of the Company
to comply with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law. No Company
Change of Recommendation shall change the approval of the board of directors
of the Company for purposes of causing any state takeover Law (including the
Interested Stockholder Statute) or other state Law to be inapplicable to the
Merger, this Agreement, the Support Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the board of
directors of the Company, in circumstances not involving or relating to a
Company Alternative Proposal, from amending, modifying or withdrawing the
Company Recommendation to the

 



\- 37 -   extent that the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such action is necessary
under applicable Law in order for the directors to comply with their
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
board of directors from disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, if, in the
good faith judgment of the Companys board of directors, after consultation
with its outside legal and financial advisors, such disclosure is required in
order for the board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations, or
is otherwise required, under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
such disclosure states that no action will be taken by the Company or the
board of directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) in violation of
this Section 5.3 and that neither the Company or the board of directors of
the Company (or any committee thereof) shall make any Company Change of
Recommendation, except as permitted by this Section 5.3, or approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Company Alternative
Proposal. 

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean
any unsolicited, bona fide, written proposal or any unsolicited bona fide,
written offer made by any person (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries) relating to (i) any merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other business combination transaction, or a "merger of equals," in each case
directly or indirectly involving the Company or any material Subsidiary; (ii)
the acquisition by any person or "group" of persons, directly or indirectly,
of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries; (iii) the issuance to or acquisition by any person or
"group" of persons of fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any material Subsidiary; or (iv) any tender offer
or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or group of
"persons" beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company or of any Subsidiary.

(g) As used in this Agreement " _Company Superior Proposal_ ", shall mean a
Company Alternative Proposal that the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisors and outside legal counsel and after taking into account relevant
financial, legal, regulatory, estimated timing of consummation and other
aspects of such proposal and the person or group making such proposal, would,
if consummated in accordance with its terms, result in a transaction more
favorable from a financial point of view to the Company and its stockholders
than the Merger (after taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms of the Merger or this Agreement). For purposes of the definition of "
_Company Superior Proposal_ ", each reference to fifteen percent (15%) in the
definition of "Company Alternative Proposal" shall be replaced with "fifty
percent (50%)."

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f) unless and until (x)
the Company has promptly (and in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours)
provided a written notice to Parent (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ")
advising Parent that the Company has received a Company Alternative Proposal
and specifying the information required by Section 5.3(b)

 



\- 38 -   and including written notice of the determination of the board of directors
of the Company that the Company Alternative Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal promptly upon the board of directors of the Company making
such determination, (y) the Company has provided Parent with an opportunity,
for a period of five (5) Business Days from the date of delivery to Parent of
the Superior Proposal Notice (the " _Match Period_ "), to amend the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Merger, including an increase in, or
modification of, the Merger Consideration (any such proposed transaction, a "
_Revised Proposal_ "), such that the Company Superior Proposal no longer
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, and (z)(1) during such Match Period,
the Company and its Representatives negotiate in good faith with Parent and
its Representatives with respect to such Revised Proposal and (2) at the end
of such Match Period, the board of directors of the Company acting in good
faith and in accordance with its fiduciary duties, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors, has determined that the
Company Superior Proposal continues to be a Company Superior Proposal
notwithstanding the Revised Proposal and taking into account all amendments
and proposed changes made thereto during the Match Period.

 

5.4 _Filings, Other Actions_.

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement (including the preliminary Proxy Statement)
and any amendment or supplement to the preliminary Proxy Statement and,
except to the extent provided in Section 5.3(c) or (d), the Proxy Statement
shall include the recommendation of the board of directors of the Company that
the Companys stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement. As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall file with
the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement; provided that, subject to applicable
Law, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file the
preliminary Proxy Statement within 30 days following the date of this
Agreement, and, thereafter, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
have the preliminary Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
furnish such preliminary Proxy Statement to Parent and give Parent and its
legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such preliminary Proxy
Statement prior to filing with the SEC and shall consider in good faith all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent in connection
therewith. The Company shall notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC staff with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and of any
requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall provide to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable,
copies of all written correspondence (and summaries of any oral comments)
between the Company or any Representative of the Company and the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC staff as promptly as
practicable;  _provided_ , _however_ , the Company shall provide Parent and
its legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
proposed response to any comment of the SEC staff and any amendment or
supplement to each of the preliminary and the definitive Proxy Statement
prior to filing with the SEC and shall consider in good faith all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent in connection therewith.
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide the Company with such
information as may be required to be included in the Proxy Statement or as may
be reasonably required to respond to any comment of the SEC staff. After all
the comments received from the SEC have been cleared 

 



\- 39 -   by the SEC staff and all information required to be contained in the Proxy
Statement have been included therein by the Company, the Company shall file
the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to
be disseminated (including by electronic delivery if permitted) as promptly as
reasonably practicable, to its stockholders of record, as of the record date
established by the board of directors of the Company. Each of the Parties
shall correct promptly, any information provided by it to be used specifically
in the Proxy Statement, if required, that shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and shall take all steps necessary to file
with the SEC and have cleared by the SEC any amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so as to correct the same and to cause the Proxy Statement as
so corrected to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each
case to the extent required by applicable Law.

(b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in order to lift
any injunctions or remove any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein.

(c) Subject to Section 7.1(g) of this Agreement, the Company shall take all
action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and subject to
the last sentence of this Section 5.4(c), no later than thirty (30) days after
the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders) for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company
Meeting_ ") and, subject to Section 5.3(c) or (d), shall include in the Proxy
Statement the recommendations of its board of directors that its stockholders
approve and adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Company Recommendation_ "). Subject to Section 5.3
of this Agreement, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Company Stockholder
Approval. Neither the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to
the Company of any Company Alternative Proposal (whether or not a Company
Superior Proposal), nor any furnishing of information, discussions or
negotiations with respect thereto, nor any decision or action by the board of
directors of the Company to effect a Company Change of Recommendation shall
give the Company any right to delay, defer or adjourn the Company Meeting or
to fail to seek the Company Stockholder Approval. For the avoidance of doubt,
the preceding sentence is intended to implement DGCL Section 146\.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjourn or postpone the
Company Meeting to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys
stockholders or to permit dissemination of information that is material to
stockholders voting at the Company Meeting, or, if as of the time the Company
Meeting is scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Meeting or for the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger.

 



\- 40 -  5.5 _Stock Options and Other Stock Based Awards; Warrants; Employee Matters_.

(a) _Stock Options and Other Stock Based Awards_. 

(i) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, as listed in
Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Company Stock
Option_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans of the Company
(the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right at the
Effective Time to receive an amount in cash, equal to the product of (x) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option, with the aggregate amount of such
payment rounded to the nearest cent (the aggregate amount of such cash
hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ ").

(ii) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to
receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured in whole or in
part by the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock, and each
award of any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock, granted under
the Company Stock Plans or the Company Benefit Plans (including performance
shares, restricted stock, restricted stock units, phantom units, deferred
stock units and dividend equivalents), other than Company Stock Options, as
listed, in each case, in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(each, a " _Company Stock-Based Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
represent a right or award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock,
shall become fully vested and shall entitle the holder thereof to receive, at
the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration in
respect of each Share underlying a particular vested Company Stock-Based Award
(the aggregate amount of such cash, together with the Option Consideration,
hereinafter referred to as the " _Option and Stock-Based Consideration_ ").

(iii) The compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company
shall pass such resolutions with respect to the Company Stock Options and
Company Stock-Based Awards consistent with the foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.5, and shall take all other actions as may be necessary
to terminate all Company Stock Plans and all outstanding Company Stock
Options and Company Stock-Based Awards thereunder.

(b)  _Warrants_. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the board of directors of the Company shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions (if any) as may be required to provide that each Warrant
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled in
exchange for a lump sum cash payment equal to (i) the product of (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Warrant and (B) the
Merger Consideration, minus (ii) the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Warrant and (B) the per share exercise
price of such Warrant (provided that if such calculation results in a negative
number, the lump sum cash payment shall be deemed to be $0). Such payment
shall be made promptly following the Effective Time. All amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 5.5(b) shall be subject to any required withholding
of Taxes and shall be paid without interest. The Company has obtained all
consents of the holders of the Warrants necessary to effectuate the foregoing.

 



\- 41 -  (c) _Employee Matters_.

(i) All employees who were employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Covered Employees_ ") shall be
employed by the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof as of the
Effective Time.

(ii) From and after the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide, to each Covered Employee who is listed on Section 5.5(c)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule (each a " _Key Employee_ ") and who remains
employed by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (i) the same
annual base salary or wage rates in effect as of the date of this Agreement
and the same annual incentive and bonus opportunities provided by the Company
in respect of 2009 as set forth under the applicable Company Benefit Plan
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of annual cash bonus
opportunities to be provided to such Covered Employees whose annual cash
bonuses in respect of 2009 were discretionary, the amount of such bonuses
actually paid to such employees shall be deemed the amount of their
"opportunity" for purposes of this provision), and (ii) employee benefits
which are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to
similarly situated Covered Employees (as a group), in each case by the Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) the foregoing covenants shall not take into account any
equity-based compensation or any change in control- or transaction-based
retention, transition, stay or similar bonus arrangements for purposes of
defining either annual incentive and bonus opportunities or employee benefits
as used in this Section 5.5(c)(ii); (B) with respect to Covered Employees who
are subject to collective bargaining agreements, compensation and benefits
shall be provided in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining
agreements; (C) so long as Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor the provisions of Section 5.5(c)(iii) below with
respect to a particular Covered Employee, Parent shall be deemed to have
satisfied the portion of the covenant contained in this Section 5.5(c)(ii)
with respect to annual cash incentive or bonus opportunities to be provided
to such Covered Employee in respect of 2010; (D) so long as Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the provisions of Section
5.5(c)(vi) (as it relates to the CIC Severance Agreements (as defined
below)), as applicable to a given Covered Employee, Parent shall be deemed to
have satisfied the portion of the covenant contained in this Section
5.5(c)(ii) with respect to any obligation to provide severance payments
and/or benefits to any such Covered Employee as may otherwise be required to
be provided hereunder; and (E) with respect to any Covered Employees based
outside the United States, Parents obligations under this Section 5.5(c)(ii)
shall be modified to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Laws of
the foreign countries and political subdivisions thereof in which such
employees are based.

 

(iii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Company shall, in each case honor all of the obligations and covenants
relating to 2010 Bonuses (as defined and, to the fullest extent, set forth on
Section 5.5(c)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule).

 



\- 42 -  (iv) With respect to any benefit plans of Parent in which Covered Employees
first become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time
(collectively, " _New Benefit Plans_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) waive any
pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Covered Employees under
any such New Benefit Plans providing medical, dental or vision benefits to
the same extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (B) provide each Covered Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective
Time during the calendar year in which such Effective Time occurs (or if
later, paid in the year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible
to participate), to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any such New Benefit Plan in
which the Covered Employee participates during the calendar year in which
such Effective Time occurs (or if later, the year in which such Covered
Employee is first eligible to participate) and (C) recognize all service of
each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time to the Company, its
Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (as well as service to Parent and its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) after the Effective Time), for purposes of eligibility
and vesting, and with respect to severance and vacation benefits only, with
respect to benefit accruals, of any New Benefit Plans (including those
providing for vacation and paid time-off) in which any Covered Employee
participates after the Effective Time; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not apply to the extent it would result in any duplication of benefits
for the same period of service.

(v) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, fulfill and
discharge, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, fulfill and
discharge, in accordance with its respective terms as in effect as of the
date hereof or as may be amended or terminated after the date hereof with the
prior written consent of Parent, each employment, change in control, severance
and termination agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any director, officer or employee of such company listed on Section 5.5(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _CIC Severance Agreements_ ") and the
obligations of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under
each deferred compensation plan or agreement listed on Section 3.9 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(vi) Nothing in this Section 5.5(c) shall be construed to (i) limit the right
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such
amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan or
applicable Law, or (ii) require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to
retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period
of time following the Closing Date.

(vii) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 express or implied shall create
any third-party beneficiary or similar rights in respect of any Covered
Employees or other current or former employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

 



\- 43 -  5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, authorizations, expirations or terminations
of waiting periods, clearances, consents and approvals, including the Company
Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,
any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) as promptly as practicable
make appropriate filings in accordance with the PRC Merger Regulation, (ii)
use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x) determining
whether any filings are required to be made with, or actions or nonactions,
waivers, authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods,
clearances, consents or approvals are required to be obtained from, any other
Governmental Entities (including any foreign jurisdiction in which the
Company or its Subsidiaries are operating any business) or third parties in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making
all such filings and timely seeking all such actions or nonactions, waivers,
authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, clearances,
consents and approvals, (iii) supply as promptly as practicable
such information or documentation that may be requested pursuant to any
Regulatory Law (as defined in Section 5.6(e)) by any Governmental Entity, and
(iv) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall each take
all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if
any, as the antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of
any nation or jurisdiction may assert under Regulatory Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate, and minimize the
impact of, each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger in each case so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no
later than the End Date (as defined in Section 7.1(b))); _provided_ , that
that Parent and the Company shall not be required to (x) propose, negotiate,
commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets, businesses, products or
product lines of Parent or the Company (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or affiliates), (y) create or terminate relationships, ventures,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries or affiliates or (z) otherwise take or commit to take
actions that after the Closing

 



\- 44 -   Date would limit the freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) or affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) or affiliates businesses, product lines or assets,
in each case as may be required in order to obtain all required actions or
nonactions, waivers, authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, clearances, consents and approvals and to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or
other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect
of preventing the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date (each of
(x), (y) and (z), a " _Divestiture_ "), unless such Divestitures are in
respect of any assets, businesses, products or product lines of Parent or the
Company the aggregate revenues of which are equal to or in excess of $7
million for the most recent fiscal year (a " _Material Divestiture_ ").

 

(c) Parent shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any investigation or litigation
by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity or other Person relating to
the Merger or regulatory filings under applicable Regulatory Law, including
any communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any contemplated
or proposed Divestiture. Without limiting the foregoing and subject to
applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity,
each of the Company and Parent agrees to (i) cooperate and consult with each
other, (ii) furnish to the other such necessary information and assistance as
the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any
notifications or filings, (iii) keep each other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions,
(iv) permit the other Party to review and incorporate the other Partys
reasonable comments in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental
Entity with respect to obtaining the necessary approvals for the Merger, and
(v) in the case of Parent, not to participate in any meeting or discussion
expected to address substantive matters related to the transactions
contemplated hereby, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the proposed transactions unless, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, it gives the Company the opportunity
to attend and observe. Subject to applicable legal limitations and
the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company agrees it shall
consult with Parent in advance of and not to participate in any meeting or
discussion expected to address substantive matters related to the transactions
contemplated hereby, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the proposed transactions unless, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, it gives Parent the opportunity to
attend and observe. The Parties shall take reasonable efforts to share
information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant
to this Section 5.6 in a manner so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

or evidenced, any indebtedness for borrowed money or money due under any long
term leasing or factoring arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary of the

acceleration of any amount due pursuant to any other outstanding financial
instrument or borrowing of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or the
enforcement of any pledge, mortgage, security, guarantee or any similar
undertaking given in relation to such financial instrument or borrowing.

statement or comment prior to such consultation except as may be required by
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national

release announcing this Agreement.

5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in
their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws or in any agreement
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a
period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect (i) the current provisions
regarding indemnification of officers and directors contained in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) any
indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries with any of
their respective directors, officers and employees existing as on the date
hereof.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and
hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each
Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses (including advancing
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual
or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding,
arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission
occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before, at or after the
Effective Time in connection with such persons serving as an officer,
director, employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of any entity if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any such Subsidiary, including any actions or
omissions or alleged actions or omissions in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



\- 47 -  (c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies or purchase a "tail policy," in either case, of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions and from
carriers with comparable credit ratings which are no less advantageous to the
insured with respect to claims arising from facts or events, actions or
omissions on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the annual
premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the year ending December
31, 2009 (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Corporation is
unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 5.10, it shall obtain
as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year
period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of
each policy year within such period. The Company may, in lieu of the
foregoing insurance coverage, purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-
year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope)
providing substantially equivalent benefits, and from a carrier or carriers
with comparable credit ratings, as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before
the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives. Parent
shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that
may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 5.10. 

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal
representatives under this Section 5.10 shall be in addition to any rights
such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any agreements between such
persons and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any applicable Laws,
or under any insurance policies.

(f) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other persons, or (ii) transfers 50% or more of its properties or
assets to any person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so
the applicable successors and assigns or transferees assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.10.

5.11  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall use all reasonable efforts to approve in advance in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of the
Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (or who will become
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby) with respect to equity securities of the Company.

 



\- 48 -  5.12 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

5.13  _Notification of Certain Matters_. From the date hereof to the
Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any
notice or other communication received by such Party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated thereby
or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be
required in connection with the Merger if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent purports to
materially affect the consummation of the Merger, (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such Partys
knowledge, threatened against such Party or any of its Subsidiaries which
purports to materially affect the consummation of the Merger, (iii) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, and (iv) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the
case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.13 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such
notice.

5.14 _Securityholder Litigation_. Company and Parent shall reasonably
cooperate in connection with the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger,
and shall not settle or offer to settle any such litigation without
Parents prior consent.

5.15 _Retention Agreements_. Retention Agreements. As soon as practicable
after the date hereof, each of Parent and the Company shall, in consultation
and cooperation with each other, use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate
and enter into retention agreements (the " _Retention Agreements_ ") with the
individuals listed in Section 5.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Retention Executives_ "), incorporating the understandings set forth in
Appendix 3 hereto, and otherwise on terms mutually acceptable to the Retention
Executives and Parent, for the purpose of incentivizing such individuals and
inducing their continued employment with the Successor Corporation following
the Closing Date in accordance with their Retention Agreements. Pursuant to
each Retention Agreement, upon the effective date of such Retention
Agreement, any existing employment agreements with the corresponding Retention
Executive shall be terminated (except with respect any restrictive covenants
applicable to such Retention Executives under such employment agreements).
