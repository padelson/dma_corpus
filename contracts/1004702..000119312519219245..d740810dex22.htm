AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 9, 2019 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among OceanFirst Financial Corp., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Hammerhead Merger Sub Corp., a New Jersey
corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
Two River Bancorp, a New Jersey corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
stockholders and shareholders, respectively, to consummate the strategic
business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which (i)
Merger Sub will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge
with and into the Company (the " _First-Step Merger_ "), so that the Company
is the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger and becomes a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent and (ii) immediately thereafter, the Company, as
the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger, will merge (the " _Second-
Step Merger_ ", and together with the First-Step Merger, the " _Integrated
Mergers_ ") with and into Parent, with Parent being the surviving corporation
(hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ");

 

WHEREAS, immediately following the consummation of the Integrated Mergers,
Two River Community Bank, a New Jersey chartered non-member bank and a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company (" _Company Bank_ "), will merge (the " _Bank
Merger_ ") with and into OceanFirst Bank, National Association, a national
banking association and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Parent Bank_
"), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the
date hereof, by and between Company Bank and Parent Bank, and attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ ");

 

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Integrated Mergers shall together be treated as a single integrated
transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
this Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a plan of reorganization
for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code and within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation section 1.368-2(g);

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and an inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain
shareholders of the Company have simultaneously herewith entered into separate
Voting and Support Agreements with Parent substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B_ (collectively, the " _Support Agreements_ ") in
connection with the First-Step Merger;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
certain officers of the Company and Company Bank have entered into amendments
to their employment and change in control agreements with the Company and
Company Bank, in the forms attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ , which
amendments will be assumed by Parent and the Parent Bank effective as of the
Effective Time; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Integrated Mergers and also to
prescribe certain conditions precedent to the consummation of the Integrated
Mergers.

   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE INTEGRATED MERGERS_

 

1.1 _The Integrated Merger_ _s; Effective Time_.

 

(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance
with the New Jersey Business Corporation Act (the " _BCA_ "), at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company. The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger, and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of New Jersey. Upon
consummation of the First-Step Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall terminate. On or before the Closing Date, Parent and the
Company, respectively, shall cause to be filed a certificate of merger with
the Department of Treasury, division of Revenue and Enterprise Services, of
the State of New Jersey (the " _New Jersey Department of Treasury_ ") in
accordance with the BCA (the " _First-Step Merger Certificate_ "). The First-
Step Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the
First-Step Merger Certificate (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General

2.3_.

 

(d) If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different
number or kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a result of a
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split or reverse

as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

agreement.

(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock award in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Equity Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Restricted
Stock Award_ ") shall be or become fully vested and the restrictions thereon

the Company shall each be a party to such reorganization within the meaning

Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ , (a) New
Certificates representing the aggregate Stock Consideration to be issued
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and exchanged pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.2(a)_ and (b) cash in an amount sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Cash
Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock, (ii) the amount
payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.7_ to holders of Company Stock Options
who are directors of the Company

 



5

    

 and (iii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such
cash and New Certificates described in the foregoing _clauses (a)_ and 
_(b)_ , together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto
(after giving effect to _Section_ __ _ 6.11_), being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that no such
investment income or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be solely for the benefit
of and paid to Parent.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
later than five (5) business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Article I_ , a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
that such holder shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with,
and subject to, _Section_ __ _ 1.5_, and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares that the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_, in the case of each of the foregoing, subject to
all applicable withholding of Tax in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.3_. From and after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old
Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
such properly completed letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of
such Old Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing the Stock Consideration that
such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled to receive in
accordance with, and subject to,  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_, and (ii) a check
representing the amount of (1) the Cash Consideration that the holder thereof
has the right to receive in respect of the surrendered Old Certificate in
accordance with, and subject to, _Section_ __ _ 1.5_, (2) any cash in lieu
of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the surrendered Old Certificate pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_ and (3)
any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_, and the Old Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrue on
the Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to
holders of Old Certificates or any dividends payable under _Section_ __ _
2.2(b)_. Until each Old Certificate is surrendered as contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_, such Old Certificate shall be deemed at all times after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the
Merger Consideration (together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in
consideration therefor), subject to all applicable withholding of Tax in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to any
holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall
surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. After the
surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_ , the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions having a record date after the Effective Time, without any
interest thereon, which, following the Effective Time and prior to the time
such Old Certificate is so surrendered, had become payable with respect to the
Stock Consideration that the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive (after
giving effect to _Section_ __ _ 6.11_).

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Old Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and
otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the

 



6

    

 registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered, or required for any
other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration (together with any dividends or distributions payable
with respect thereto in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_, subject to
all applicable withholding of Tax in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_,
and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, that the holder presenting such Old
Certificates is entitled to, as provided in this _Article II_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall, following the Effective Time, pay to each former
shareholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the VWAP of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ (as reported
by  _Bloomberg L.P._ (or, if such information is no longer reported by
Bloomberg L.P., as reported by a comparable internationally recognized source
mutually determined by Parent and the Company)) for the five (5) full trading
days ending on the last trading day preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the
fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the shareholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time
shall be paid to Parent. Any former shareholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration (together with any dividends
or distributions payable with respect thereto in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.2(b)_ and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration
therefor in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_) in respect of each
former share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

(g) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
the Exchange Agent may require, the Exchange Agent or Parent, as applicable,
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the
Merger Consideration (together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto and any cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in
consideration therefor) in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

2.3 _Tax Withholdings_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
each of Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ or
any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person
such amounts as it determines it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Entity, the withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in
respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

ARTICLE III

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company and (iii) any disclosures made in the Company Disclosure
Schedule with respect to a section of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to
qualify any other section of this _Article III_ (A) specifically referenced or
cross-referenced in such disclosure or (B) to the extent it is reasonably
apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-
reference) from a reading of the disclosure, that such disclosure applies to
such other section of this _Article III_ or (b) as disclosed in any Company
Reports publicly filed by the Company since December 31, 2018, and prior to
the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the
heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-
looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly
non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The  Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey, and is a bank holding
company duly registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (the " _Federal Reserve Board_ ") as a bank holding company under the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC Act_ "). The Company
has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a
material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect
to this _clause (i)_ , Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include
the impacts of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting
requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or
regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in which
such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by
Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national
or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of
terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the financial
services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its
Subsidiaries, (D) public disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby
or actions expressly required by this Agreement or actions or omissions that
are taken with the prior written consent of the other party in contemplation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or (E) the reasonable, customary and
documented expenses incurred by either party in negotiating and complying with
the provisions of this Agreement and in documenting, effecting and
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; except,
with respect to _subclauses (A)_ , _(B)_ or _(C)_ , to the extent that the
impacts of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the
business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared
to other companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries
operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Subsidiary_ ", when used with respect to any person, means any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, bank or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, or 

 



8

    

 person of which (x) such first person directly or indirectly owns or
controls at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by
their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or others performing similar functions or (y) such first person is
or directly or indirectly has the power to appoint a general partner, manager
or managing member or others performing similar functions.

 

(b) True, correct and complete copies of the Company Certificate and the
Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement, have previously been made available by the Company to
Parent.

 

(c) Company Bank is a non-member bank duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey. The deposits of
Company Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "
_FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection
therewith have been paid when due and no proceedings for the termination of
such insurance are pending or threatened. Company Bank is a member in good
standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the " _FHLB_ ") and owns
the requisite amount of stock therein.

 

(d) Each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a " _Company Subsidiary_ "), (i)
is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under Law, is in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether
federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property
or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified, except where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) has all requisite company, partnership
or corporate (as applicable) power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There
are no restrictions on the ability of any Company Subsidiary to pay dividends
or distributions except, in the case of a Company Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions
generally applicable to all such regulated entities. Other than Company Bank
and those Subsidiaries set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no Company Subsidiaries.

 

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 25,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and 6,500,000 shares of preferred stock,
without par value, of which no shares of preferred stock are issued or
outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, there are (i) 8,690,610 shares

Company issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of any preemptive

certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.

directors or executive officers that would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
or (ii) challenging the validity or propriety of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

restriction imposed upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets,

hold, and have at all times since January 1, 2016 held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,

and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where neither
the failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding any such license,
franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any such fees or
assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and, to the knowledge of
Parent, no suspension or cancellation of any such license, franchise, permit
or authorization is threatened. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have

sensitive information. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
require Parent or the Company to take any action, or commit to take any
action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining
the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental
Entities that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
(measured on a scale relative to the Company) on any of Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, after giving effect to the Integrated Mergers (a "
_Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

 



39

    

(c) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with
all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and shareholders, as applicable, and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Integrated Mergers,
the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will be materially delayed or conditioned.
As used herein, " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ " means (i) all regulatory
authorizations, consents, permits, orders or approvals from the Federal
Reserve Board, the OCC and the NJ Department and (ii) any other approvals set
forth in _Sections 3.4_ and  _4.4_ , in each case (x) that are necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Integrated Mergers and the Bank Merger) or (y) the failure of which to be
obtained would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation.

 

6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Law, the Company, for
the purposes of enabling Parent to verify the representations and warranties
of the Company and to prepare for the Integrated Mergers and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
advisors and other representatives of Parent, access, during normal business
hours during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
to all of the Companys properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel, information technology systems, Tax Returns and related work
papers and records reasonably requested by Parent. The Company shall cooperate
with Parent in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly make
available to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by the Company during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or
state banking laws (other than reports or documents which the Company is not
permitted to disclose under Law) and (ii) all other information concerning
the Companys business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose (x) board and committee minutes that discuss
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) information
where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of the
Companys customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or the right
to assert the work product doctrine of the institution in possession or
control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence
of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the
parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Parent shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the
Company or its Representatives pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ in confidence
to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement, dated May 31, 2019, among Parent, the Company and
Boenning (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(c) No investigation (or discovery or receipt of information) by any party
hereto or their respective Representatives shall affect or be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of
the other parties set forth herein or the conditions to any partys obligation
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give any party hereto, directly

 



40

    

 or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other
party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective
operations.

 6.3 _Company Shareholders_ __ _Approval_.

 

(a) The Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ") to
be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective
for the purpose of obtaining (i) the Requisite Company Vote required in
connection with this Agreement and the First-Step Merger and (ii) if so
desired and mutually agreed by the parties, the approval of other matters of
the type customarily brought before a special meeting of shareholders to
approve a merger agreement or otherwise approve the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_, the Board of Directors of
the Company shall (i) recommend to its shareholders the approval of this
Agreement, the First-Step Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), (ii) include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the shareholders of the Company the Requisite Company Vote,
including by communicating to its shareholders the Company Recommendation and
(iv) not withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation or take any action, or make any public statement,
filing or release inconsistent with the Company Recommendation, or submit
this Agreement to the Companys shareholders for a vote without the Company
Recommendation.

 (c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, if the
Board of Directors of the Company, after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor,
determines in good faith that it would be a violation of its fiduciary duties
under Law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this
Agreement to the Companys shareholders, the Board of Directors of the
Company may (but shall not be required to) modify, withdraw or change the
Company Recommendation or submit this Agreement to the Companys shareholders
without the Company Recommendation (each, a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date
hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors
of the Company may communicate the basis for the Company
Adverse Recommendation Change to its shareholders in the Proxy Statement or
an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by Law;
_provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company may not take any action
under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_ unless (i) such action is taken in
response to an Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal (x) did not
result from a breach by the Company of _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ and (y)
constitutes a Superior Proposal; (ii) the Company gives Parent at least two
(2) business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
and a reasonable description of the events or circumstances giving rise to
its determination to take such action (including its basis for determining
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (including the
latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third party
making, the Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof));
(iii) during such two (2) business day period, the Company has considered and
negotiated (and has caused its Representatives to consider and negotiate) with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) regarding
any adjustments or modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by Parent; and (iv) at the end of such notice period, the Board of
Directors of the Company takes into account any amendment or modification to
this Agreement proposed by Parent ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that Parent
shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), and after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisor, again determines in good faith that it would
nevertheless result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under Law to
continue to recommend this Agreement and that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal. Any material amendment to any Acquisition
Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_ and will require a new determination and notice
period as referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_.

 



41

    

(d) The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting if, (i) as
of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Meeting or (ii) on the date of the Company Meeting, the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to
obtain the Requisite Company Vote; _provided_ that, from and after such time,
if any, that (in response to an Acquisition Proposal that has been received
by the Company and that has been publicly disclosed or otherwise become
public) the Company makes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change that is
permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_, the Company thereafter shall not be so
required to adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting more than two (2) times
following such time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company
Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the
shareholders of the Company at the Company Meeting for the purpose of voting
on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby,
and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such
obligation, including if the Company makes a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to  _Section_
__ _ 6.1_ (including the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_), each of
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal
requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Integrated Mergers and the Bank Merger and, subject to
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Integrated Mergers and the Bank
Merger) and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain)
any material consent, authorization, permit, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Integrated Mergers, the Bank Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the First-Step
Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
first anniversary thereof, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continue to be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
immediately following the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "),
while employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, with
base salaries, wages and employee benefits (excluding equity and equity based
compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the base
salaries, wages and employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that Parent may satisfy
its obligation under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ by providing or causing the
Surviving Corporation to provide such Continuing Employees with base salaries,
wages and employee benefits (excluding equity and equity based
compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the base
salaries, wages and employee benefits provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its
Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i)
waive all exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible
dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and their eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time under

 



42

    

 a Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under
the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying
any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans,
and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such
service was taken into account under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall
not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for
the same period of services, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit pension
plan or benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to any
benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

(c) Unless Parent requests otherwise in writing at least five days prior
to the Closing, effective as of the date immediately preceding the Closing
Date and contingent upon the consummation of the Integrated Mergers, the
Company shall terminate the Two River Community Bank 401(k) Plan (the "
_Terminated Plan_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide
Parent with resolutions adopted by the Companys Board of Directors
terminating the Terminated Plan, the form and substance of which shall be
subject to the prior written approval of Parent, which will not be
unreasonably withheld. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time,
with respect to the Terminated Plan, Parent shall permit or cause its
Subsidiaries (including Parent Bank) to permit the Continuing Employees to
roll over their account balances and outstanding loan balances, if any,
thereunder into an "eligible retirement plan" within the meaning of Section
402(c)(8)(B) of the Code maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including
Parent Bank).

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee,
officer, director, independent contractor or consultant of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or
service of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights
of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee,
officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify
any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 9.9_,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any person, including without limitation any current or former employee,
officer, director, independent contractor or consultant (or any spouse or
dependent of such individual) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

(e) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor through December
31 of the year in which the Closing occurs, under the vacation policies of the
Company, as disclosed on Section 6.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the accrued but unused vacation time of employees of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries who were employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the extent
that the accrued and unused amount is fully reflected in the most
recent financial statements included in the Company Reports as of the Closing
Date.

(f) Any employee of the Company (excluding any employee who is party to an
employment agreement that provides for severance payments) whose employment is
terminated (other than for cause, as defined in Parents severance policy) at
the written request of Parent (but by and in the sole discretion of the
Company) prior to the Effective Time, or is terminated by Parent or a
Subsidiary of Parent within one year following the Effective Time in a manner
entitling such individual to benefits under the Parents severance policy,
shall be entitled to receive severance payments in accordance with the
schedule set forth in Section 6.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(g) Parent and the Company shall create a retention pool on terms, in
amounts and for employees of the Company as mutually agreed by Parent and the
Company. Following the Effective Time,

 



43

    

 retention payments under such pool shall be made to the applicable
individuals if they are still employed by the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries on their designated "work through" date as set forth in a
written retention bonus pool agreement. The form and terms of such agreement,
the amount of the payment to each individual and the timing of such payments
shall be agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company no later than 30 days
following the date of this Agreement, and shall promptly thereafter be
communicated to each such employee by the Company and Parent. The maximum
aggregate amount of such retention bonuses and the general terms of such
retention bonuses are set forth in Section 6.6(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, each present and former director, officer or employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (in each case, for actions taken in such
capacity) (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the
Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the fullest extent such
persons are entitled to be indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by
the Company pursuant to the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws or the
governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company
applicable to such person. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
also advance expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent such persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the
date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company Certificate, the
Company Bylaws or the governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary
of the Company; _provided_ that, if requested by Parent, the Company
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in
reasonable and customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined in a final determination or by a court of competent jurisdiction
that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company ( _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount
that, in the aggregate, exceeds 250% of the current annual premium paid as of
the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "),
and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium
Cap, then Parent shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in
Parents good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available for
an aggregate cost equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the
Company, in consultation with Parent, but only upon the prior written consent
of Parent, may (and at the request of Parent, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a
six-year prepaid "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in
the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for
an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap and, in such
case, Parent shall not have any further obligations under this  _Section_ __
_ 6.7(b)_, other than to maintain such prepaid "tail" policy.

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall survive the
Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives. If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns will consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all
or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage
in any similar transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the

 



44

    

 Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and the Company under this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall not be
terminated or modified in a manner so as to adversely affect the Company
Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_ without the prior written consent of the affected
Company Indemnified Party or affected person.

 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary
of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other
hand) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties,
assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to
the Integrated Mergers, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

 

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company shall each promptly (but
in no event more than 24 hours) advise the other party of any change or event
(i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
it or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of any condition in _Article
VII_ ; _provided_ that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ or the failure of any condition set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result
in a failure of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _7.3_ to
be satisfied.

 

6.10 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other party in writing of any action, arbitration, audit,
hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, dispute, proceeding, subpoena or
summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or
otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the
knowledge of either such party, threatened against the Company, Parent or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, in each case that (a) questions or would
reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the
Integrated Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby or any
actions taken or to be taken by Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries with respect to this Agreement, the Integrated Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated hereby or (b) seeks to enjoin, restrain or
prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to direct (at Parents own expense) the defense or settlement
of any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors,
officers or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company shall not agree to any such settlement of any such
litigation without Parents prior written consent which shall not
unreasonably be withheld.

6.11 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends
in respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record
dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in respect of any quarter with
respect to their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares of
Parent Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the
First-Step Merger.

 

6.12 _Corporate Governance_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent
shall (a) increase the size of the Board of Directors of Parent by one (1)
member, and cause Parent Bank to take such actions as may be necessary to
increase the size of the Board of Directors of Parent Bank by one (1) member,
and (b) appoint one member of the Board of Directors of the Company, to be
selected by the Leadership Committee of Parent in consultation with the Board
of Directors of Parent (the " _New Member_ "), to the Boards of Directors of
Parent and Parent Bank, respectively, for terms to expire at Parents next
annual meeting of stockholders. Parent also agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause a member of the Board of Directors of the
Company other than the New Member to be added to the OceanFirst Foundation
Board promptly after the Effective Time.

 



45

    

6.13 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries
or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to
any person (other than Parent, Parent Bank and their Representatives in their
capacity as such) concerning any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) have or
participate in any discussions with any person (other than Parent, Parent Bank
and their Representatives in their capacity as such) relating to any
Acquisition Proposal, except, for purposes of this clause (iv) to notify such
person of the existence of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.13(a)_;
_provided_ that prior to the date of the Company Meeting, in the event the
Company receives from any person other than Parent, Parent Bank or their
respective Representatives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, it
may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or
data to, and participate in, discussions with such person with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal but only to the extent that, prior to doing so, its
Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisor) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) failure to take such
actions would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under Law;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that, prior to providing any nonpublic information
or data or participating in any discussions, in each case, permitted pursuant
to the foregoing proviso, the Company shall have provided such information or
data to Parent and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with
such person on terms no less stringent to such person than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide
such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company or its
Representatives. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ by any
Subsidiary or Representative of the Company shall constitute a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.13_ by the Company.

(b) The Company will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the execution of this Agreement with any person (other than
Parent, Parent Bank and their Representatives in their capacity as such) with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts,
subject to Law, to (x) enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal and (y) within ten (10)
business days after the date hereof, request and confirm the return or
destruction of any confidential information provided to any person (other than
Parent, Parent Bank and their Representatives in their capacity as such)
pursuant to any such agreement.

(c) Promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall advise Parent
of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the substance thereof (including
the terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such
inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, copies of any written Acquisition Proposal
and written summaries of any material oral communications relating to an
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(d) As used herein,

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or
any third party indication of interest in, (A) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute more than

 



46

    

 25% of the consolidated assets of the Company; (B) any tender offer
(including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in any person (other than Parent or Parent Bank) beneficially owning
25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 25% of the consolidated assets of the Company; or (C) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company and/or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the
Company; and

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited bona fide written offer
or proposal made by a third party to consummate an Acquisition Proposal that
the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith (after receiving the
advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters,
its financial advisor) (A) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition
of all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company; (B)
would result in a transaction that (1) involves consideration to the holders
of the shares of Company Common Stock that is, after accounting for payment of
the Termination Fee that may be required hereunder, more favorable, from a
financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to the
shareholders of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among
other things, the nature of the consideration being offered and any material
regulatory approvals or other risks associated with the timing of the
proposed transaction beyond, or in addition to, those specifically
contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not conditioned upon obtaining
financing and (2) is, in light of the other terms of such proposal,
more favorable to the shareholders of the Company than the Integrated Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (C) is
reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case, taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ that such
Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

6.14 _Board of Directors and Committee Meetings_. Following the receipt of
the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, the Company shall permit representatives
of Parent to attend any meeting of its board of directors or the executive and
loan committees thereof as an observer, subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_  that the Company shall not be required to permit such
representatives to remain present during any confidential discussions of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or any Acquisition Proposal
or during any other matter (a) that the Board of Directors of the Company has
reasonably determined to be confidential with respect to the participation of
Parent or Parent Bank or (b) that the Company would not be required to
disclose under  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ of this Agreement.

6.15 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to (a) develop a joint communications plan and ensure
that all press releases and other public disclosure (including communications
to employees, agents and contractors) with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with such joint communications
plan and (b) consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to
the extent practicable, otherwise making any public disclosure with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case,
except in respect of any press release or public disclosure (i) required by
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange or (ii) the content and messaging of which is
substantially similar to public disclosure previously made by Parent or the
Company either on the date of this Agreement or following the date of this
Agreement and in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.15_.

Parents request, the Company shall regularly discuss and reasonably cooperate
with Parent and Parent Bank in connection with (a) planning for the efficient
and orderly combination of the Company and Parent Bank and the operation of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and (b) preparing for the
consolidation of appropriate operating functions to be effective at the
Effective Time or such later date as Parent may decide. Each party
shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally (including by
entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and
similar agreements with related service providers and other parties). Prior
to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, including this _Article VI_ , complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

6.17 _Restructuring Efforts_. If the Company shall have failed to obtain
the Requisite Company Vote at the duly convened Company Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, then, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the parties shall in good
faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall
have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the
amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common
Stock as provided for in this Agreement, in a manner adverse to such party or
its stockholders or shareholders, as applicable) and/or resubmit this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.17_) to the Companys shareholders for
approval.

 

6.18 _Takeover Statutes_. None of the Company, Parent or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Support Agreements, the
Integrated Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and
each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Integrated Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any
Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and the Company and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary, so that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability
of any such Takeover Statute.

 

6.19 _Assumption of Company Debt_. Effective as of the effective time of
the Second-Step Merger, Parent shall enter into an assumption of debt in
accordance with the applicable terms of the Subordinated Note, dated as of
December 14, 2015, providing for assumption by Parent of the Companys
obligations thereunder, in accordance with Section 4 therein, with respect to
the subordinated notes due December  31, 2025.

6.20   _Cybersecurity_. The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, engage a third party who is reasonably
acceptable to Parent (the " _Systems Consultant_ "), at Parents sole cost and
expense, to (i) conduct an examination and review of the Company Systems for
the purpose of identifying any deficiencies, weaknesses or vulnerabilities in
such Company Systems (including any deficiencies, weaknesses or
vulnerabilities relating to (A) unauthorized access, disabling codes or
instructions, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, viruses or other software
routines that permit or cause unauthorized access to, or disruption,
impairment, disablement, or destruction of, software, data or other materials
or (B) prevention and mitigation of risks of cybersecurity breaches and
attacks) and (ii) prepare a written report that assesses the matters described
in clause (i) (the " _Systems Report_ "). The Company shall request that the
Systems Consultant deliver the Systems Report to the Company and Parent as
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and shall so deliver the
Systems Report to Parent no later than December 9, 2019 or, if earlier, the
Closing Date). The Company shall, prior to the Closing, remediate any
weaknesses, deficiencies or vulnerabilities identified in the Systems Report
to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent.

6.21 _Exemption from Liability Under Section_ __ _ 16(b)_. The Company
and Parent agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain the
Company Insiders (as defined below), both prior to and after the Effective
Time, it is desirable that the Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by Law in connection with the conversion of shares of Company Common
Stock and the Company Equity Awards in the First-Step Merger, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 6.21_. Assuming the Company delivers to Parent in a reasonably timely
fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information regarding those
officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_ "), the Board of
Directors of Parent and of the Company, or a committee of non-employee
directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under
the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event
prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause
(in the case of the Company) any dispositions of Company Common Stock or the
Company Equity Awards by the Company Insiders, and (in the case of Parent) any
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock by any Company Insiders who, immediately
following the Integrated Mergers, will be officers or directors of the
Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

 

6.22 _Shareholder Rights Plan_. The Company shall, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (and in any event no later than the close
of business on the tenth Business Day (as defined in the Shareholder Rights
Plan) following the date hereof), redeem all of the Rights in accordance with
Section 23 of the Shareholder Rights Plan.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT_

 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after the receipt of the Requisite
Company Vote:

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument,
if the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board of Directors;

 

(b) by either the Board of Directors of Parent or the Board of Directors of
the Company, if (i) any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite
Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Integrated Mergers or the Bank
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and such denial has
become final and nonappealable, (ii) any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) an application for a
Requisite Regulatory Approval shall have been withdrawn at the request of the
applicable Governmental Entity, unless, in the case of this clause (iii), (A)
the approval of such Governmental Entity is no longer necessary under
applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or (B) the
party whose application was withdrawn intends to file, and such filing is made
no later than the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of withdrawal, a new
application, filing, certificate or notice with a Governmental Entity to
obtain the necessary Requisite Regulatory Approval, unless, in any such case
of clause (i), (ii) or (iii), the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory
Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 



51

    

(c) by either the Board of Directors of Parent or the Board of Directors
of the Company, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before May 31,
2020 (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur
by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

(d) by either the Board of Directors of Parent or the Board of Directors of
the Company ( _provided_ that the terminating party is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or
agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such
representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement
on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent,
in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or failure to be
true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such
party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would
constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a
condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, in the case of a termination by
Parent, or _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, in the case of a termination by the Company,
and which is not cured within forty-five (45) days following written notice
to the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or to Parent, in the
case of a termination by the Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be
cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the
Termination Date);

 

(e) by Parent, prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if
the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (i) failed to make the
Company Recommendation or failed to include the Company Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified the Company
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, or resolved to do so or failed
to reaffirm such recommendation within two (2) business days after Parent
requests in writing that such action be taken, (ii) failed to recommend
against acceptance of any publicly disclosed tender offer or exchange offer
for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock by any person (other than
Parent or any affiliate of Parent), within the ten (10) business day period
specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, in any such case whether
or not permitted by the terms hereof, (iii) recommended or endorsed an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) breached any of its obligations under _Section_
__ _ 6.3_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ in any material respect;

(f) by the Company, following the Company Meeting (including any
adjournments or postponements thereof), if the Company (i) received an
Acquisition Proposal prior to the Company Meeting, (ii) has not breached any
of its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ and
(iii) failed to obtain the Requisite Company Vote at the duly convened Company
Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; or

 

(g) by the Company, if its Board of Directors so determines by a vote of a
majority of the members of its entire Board of Directors within a five (5)
day period commencing on the Determination Date, if both of the following
conditions are satisfied, such termination to be effective on the tenth (10th)
day following the Determination Date:

(i) the Parent Market Value on the Determination Date is less than $19.36;
and

(ii) the number obtained by dividing the Parent Market Value on the
Determination Date by the Initial Parent Market Value is less than the number
obtained by dividing (x) the Final Index Price by (y) the Initial Index Price
minus 0.15;

 

 _subject_ , _however_ , to the remainder of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_. If
the Company elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_, it shall promptly (and in any event no later than the
last day of the five (5) day period commencing on the Determination Date)
notify Parent in writing of such election. During the five (5) day period
commencing with Parents receipt of the written notice referenced in the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall have the option to increase the
Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one one-thousandth) to equal the
lesser of (x) a quotient, the numerator of which is equal to the product of
the Initial Parent Market Value, the Exchange Ratio (as 

 



52

    

 then in effect), and the Index Ratio minus 0.15 and the denominator of which
is equal to the Parent Market Value on the Determination Date; or (y) the
quotient determined by dividing the Initial Parent Market Value by the Parent
Market Value on the Determination Date, and multiplying such quotient by the
product of the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and 0.80. If Parent so
elects, by delivering written notice of such election to the Company within
such five (5) day period referenced in the immediately preceding sentence to
increase the consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common
Stock by so adjusting the Exchange Ratio, which notice shall set forth the
revised Exchange Ratio, then no termination shall be permitted by, or shall
have occurred pursuant to, this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_, and this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms
(except that the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified). For purposes of
this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

 

(i) The " _Determination Date_ " means the first date on which all
Requisite Regulatory Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) necessary for
consummation of the Integrated Mergers have been received (disregarding any
waiting period).

 

(ii) The " _Final Index Price_ " means the average of the closing price of
the Index, for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the

average of the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on
the NASDAQ for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding
such specified date.

 

If Parent or any company belonging to the Index declares or effects a stock
dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up or combination between
the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the prices for the
common stock of such company shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes
of applying this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their
respective affiliates or any of their respective employees, officers,
directors or representatives shall have any liability of any nature
whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, except that (i) _ Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ and this _Section_ __ _
8.2_ and _Article IX_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and
(ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or any knowing, intentional
and material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement.

the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made known to senior management or the Board of Directors of the
Company or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally or any
person shall have publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal or the intention
to make an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not

 



53

    

 conditional) with respect to the Company, (ii) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by (A) either Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.1(c)_ and the Requisite Company Vote has not been obtained or (B) Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ solely in the case of a willful breach of
this Agreement, and (iii) on or prior to the date that is twelve (12) months
after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement (regardless of whether a transaction is consummated) or consummates
a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the
same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to in _clause (b)(i)_ above), then
the Company shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to

of same day funds, an amount in cash equal to the Termination Fee on the date
of such termination.

 

(d) 

 

(i) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_ and (B) the Company made a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change prior to such termination, then the Company
shall, on the date of termination, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, an amount in cash equal to the Termination Fee; or

(ii) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, (B) the Company did not make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change prior to such termination and (C) on or prior to
the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement (regardless of whether a
transaction is consummated) or consummates a transaction with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_ above), then the Company shall, on the
earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of
consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, an amount in cash equal to the Termination Fee.

(e) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements,
Parent would not enter into this Agreement and (iii) the Termination Fee
constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty. Accordingly, if the Company
fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results
in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, as applicable, the
Company shall pay the costs and expenses of Parent (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if
the Company fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.2_ when due, then the Company shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at
a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and
Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was
required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid.

 

(f) Without limiting any amount that may be payable by the Company under
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_, the Termination Fee constitutes liquated damages and
not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or a knowing, intentional and
material breach, shall be the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event of a
termination of this Agreement.

 

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with Law, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Integrated Mergers by the
shareholders of the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after adoption of
this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, there may not be, without
further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that
requires further approval 

 



54

    

 of the Company shareholders under Law. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

 

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally permitted, extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and waive
compliance with any of the agreements or satisfaction of any conditions
contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after adoption of this
Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, there may not be, without
further approval of the Company shareholders, any extension or waiver of this
Agreement or any portion thereof that requires further approval of the Company
shareholders under Law. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure to comply with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition.

APPLICABLE LAW AT THE TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B)
EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER,
(C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL

9.9 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
party. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other than

 



57

    

 the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to
rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

9.10 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy expressly
conferred hereby, and the exercise by a party of any one such remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other such remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate
the Integrated Mergers), in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a)
any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would
be adequate and (b)  any requirement under any law to post security or a
bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

9.11   _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under Law, but if any provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect under any Law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion
of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed,
construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.

 

9.12 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement
and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto shall (and each party hereto shall cause
its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to) raise the use of a facsimile
machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver a
signature to this Agreement or any signed agreement or instrument entered into
in connection with this Agreement, or any amendments or waivers hereto or
thereto, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
