the resolution of such remaining Objections. Acquiror and Seller shall

remaining Objections. The CPA Firm's determination with respect to the
remaining Objections shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. The

aspects of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount shall have become conclusive and
binding on the parties pursuant to the foregoing provisions, (i) if the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative number, Acquiror will pay the absolute
value thereof to BBHI Holdings by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated by Seller and (ii) if the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then Seller will cause BBHI Holdings
to pay the value thereof to Acquiror by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Acquiror.

state, local or foreign Tax Law, and pay such withholding amount over to the

rights, sale or other disposition of, or subject to any Encumbrance, the
Membership Interests. Neither Seller nor BBHI Holdings is a party to any
voting trust, proxy or other agreement or understanding (other than this
Agreement and the LLC Agreement) with respect to the voting of the Membership
Interests or any other Equity Interest in the Company. Assuming Acquiror has
the requisite power and authority to be the lawful owner of the Membership
Interests, upon the sale and delivery of the Membership Interests as provided
in this Agreement, Acquiror will acquire good and valid title to such
Membership Interests, in each case free and clear of all Encumbrances and free
of any limitation or restriction on the right to vote the Membership
Interests, in each case, other than those arising from Acquiror's ownership or
actions. All of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests in the Company and
each of the Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable, no Equity Interests of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries are reserved for issuance and, as of the Closing Date, there will
be no dividends or distributions with respect to any Equity Interests of the
Company that have been declared but not paid. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary nor any of their Affiliates has granted any outstanding securities,
options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or
by which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound obligating the Company or any
Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, any additional Equity Interests, or obligating the Company or any
Subsidiary to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option,
warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or undertaking.

authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and any other documents and

Related Agreements. BBHI Holdings has full limited liability company power and
authority to perform the actions that this Agreement provides that Seller

or the Subsidiaries with, any Person in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement, other than those the
failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (the
"Seller Consents").

  

  

Section 3.4 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transaction do not and
will not (i) violate any provision of any certificate of formation, articles
of organization, operating agreement or other organizational documents of
Seller, BBHI Holdings, the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) assuming the
receipt or making of all Seller Consents, violate, or result in any material
breach of, or constitute a material default under, or result in the
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration (whether after the
filing of notice or the lapse of time or both) of any material right or
obligation of the Company or the Subsidiaries under, or result in a loss of
any material benefit to which the Company or a Subsidiary is entitled under,
any Contract, Franchise, Lease or Demising Lease, or result in the creation of
any Encumbrance other than a Permitted Encumbrance upon any material assets of
the Company or any Subsidiary, or (iii) subject to compliance with the HSR
Act, and assuming the receipt or making of all Seller Consents with respect to
Government Entities and of all Acquiror Consents, violate or result in a
breach of or constitute a default under any Law to which Seller, BBHI
Holdings, the Company or a Subsidiary is subject, or under any Governmental
Authorization.

  

  

Section 3.5 Binding Effect. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by the other parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes a valid and legally
binding obligation of Seller enforceable against Seller in accordance with its
terms, except insofar as enforceability may be limited by applicable

consolidated balance sheet and audited consolidated statements of operations,

unaudited consolidated balance sheet and unaudited consolidated statements of
operations, changes in members' equity and cash flows of the Company at and

the System Reports reflecting the categories of "revenues, net" and "operating
expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense" for October,
November and December in 2012 (the "Monthly System Profit Statements"). The
Audited Financial Statements and the Unaudited 2012 Financial Statements have

be material in nature or amount) and the absence of notes and similar
presentation items therein. The Company and the Subsidiaries maintain a system
of accounting and internal controls that provides reasonable assurances that
financial transactions are executed in accordance with the authorization of
management. There has been no material complaint, allegation or claim made to
the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods or internal controls over
financial reporting of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries. The Monthly
System Profit Statements have been prepared from the system of accounting and
internal controls of the Company and the Subsidiaries that were used to
prepare the Audited Financial Statements and the Unaudited 2012 Financial
Statements and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated net
revenues and operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization
expense, of the Company for the respective periods covered thereby.

to any of the language preceding any such clauses).

  

  

Section 3.8 Absence of Liabilities . Except as specifically reflected,
reserved against or otherwise disclosed in the Unaudited 2012 Financial

statements prepared in accordance with GAAP other than (a) Liabilities

arising from compliance by the Company or any Subsidiary with the terms of any

respect to any of such Governmental Authorizations.

  

  

(b) Each Governmental Authorization set forth in Section 3.10(a) of the Seller

any such renewal under Section 626 of the Communications Act, and the Company
and the Subsidiaries have duly and timely complied in all material respects
with any and all inquiries and demands by any and all Government Entities made
with respect to the Company's or such Subsidiary's requests for any such
renewal, and (iv) none of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any
Government Entity has commenced or requested the commencement of an
administrative proceeding concerning the renewal of a material Franchise as
provided in Section 626(c)(1) of the Communications Act. The Company is in
material compliance with all rules and regulations promulgated by the FCC with
respect to the procedures for seeking such renewals.

  

  

(c) With respect to the Franchises, the Company has not made any material
commitment to any Government Entity that is not set forth in the applicable

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) With respect to any System that is being operated without a Franchise, the
Company or the Subsidiaries have operated such Systems on a continuous basis
since acquiring such System and, to the Company's Knowledge, the respective
predecessors that owned the Systems operated such Systems on a continuous
basis since before January 1, 1984 until such Systems were acquired by the
Company or the Subsidiaries, such that each such System is lawful under
Section 621(b)(2) of the Communications Act. As of the date of this Agreement,

the Company nor the Subsidiaries are in breach of or default under any
Material Contract, Lease or Demising Lease, and, to the Company's Knowledge,

extent provided in such Lease. True and complete copies of all such Leases
have been made available to Acquiror.

  

  

(c) Each of the Company and each Subsidiary (i) that owns a fee interest in a
parcel of Owned Real Property has good and marketable title thereto, and (ii)
that leases Leased Real Property pursuant to a Lease has a valid leasehold
interest therein (subject to expiration of such Lease in accordance with its
terms), except to the extent that the failure to have any such valid leasehold
interest would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
and in the case of each of clauses (i) or (ii) free and clear of all
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances.

  

  

(d) To the Company's Knowledge, the ownership, occupancy, use and operation of

having the right to occupy any of the Owned Real Property and Leased Real
Property pursuant to Demising Leases. There are no outstanding agreements,
options, rights of first offer or rights of first refusal to purchase any

appropriation, condemnation, eminent domain or like proceedings relating to
the Owned Real Property or, to the Company's Knowledge, the Leased Real
Property or (ii) proceedings to change the zoning classification, variance,
special use, or other applicable land use law of any portion of the Owned Real
Property or, to the Company's Knowledge, the Leased Real Property, except to
the extent such proceedings would not reasonably be expected to have a

(g) As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Owned Real Property or the
Leased Real Property has suffered any material damage by fire or other
casualty that has not been or will not prior to the Closing have been repaired
and restored in all material respects, except for damage that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the use of such property
in the conduct of the Business.

  

  

Section 3.13 Tangible Personal Property; Sufficiency of Assets. All material
items of Fixtures and Equipment are, in the aggregate (and with due
consideration for reasonable wear and tear and the age of each specific item
of Fixtures and Equipment), in sufficient operating condition and repair for
their respective present uses and operation. Each of the Company and each
Subsidiary (i) that owns any material item of Fixtures and Equipment has good
and valid title thereto and (ii) that leases any material item of Fixtures and
Equipment has a valid leasehold interest therein (subject to expiration of any
applicable Contract in accordance with its terms), except to the extent that
the failure to have any such valid leasehold interest would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and in the case of each of clauses
(i) and (ii), free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances. At the Closing and taking into account the rights of the Company
and the Subsidiaries under the Transition Services Agreement, the Company and
the Subsidiaries will own, or have a valid legal right to use, sufficient
property, assets and other rights (whether tangible or intangible) to be able

incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability under Subtitle E

(c) Each of the Benefit Plans is in material compliance with ERISA (where
applicable), the Code and other applicable laws. Each Benefit Plan which is
subject to ERISA (an "ERISA Plan") that is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service and the Company, the
Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates are not aware of any circumstances
likely to result in the loss of the qualification of any such plan under
Section 401(a) of the Code. Each trust in which such Pension Plan assets are
held is exempt from tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code.

  

  

(d) Nothing done or omitted to be done and no transaction or holding of any
asset under or in connection with any Benefit Plan has made or will make the
Company, the Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, or any officer or director
of the Company, the Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, subject to any
Liability under Title I or ERISA or any Liability for any tax under Section
4972 or Sections 4975 through 4980G, inclusive.

  

  

(e) None of the Benefit Plans is a "single-employer plan", within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, and no liability Title IV of ERISA has been
or is expected to be incurred by the Company, the Subsidiaries or their ERISA
Affiliates.

  

  

(f) All contributions required to be made under each Benefit Plan have been
timely made and all obligations in respect of each Benefit Plan have been
properly accrued and reflected in the financial statements of the Company, the
Subsidiaries or their ERISA Affiliates.

  

  

(g) Under each Benefit Plan where relevant, as of the last day of the most
recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the present value of all
benefit liabilities did not exceed the then current value of the assets of
such Benefit Plan, and there has been no material change in the financial
condition of the Benefit Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year.
The Company, the Subsidiaries and its ERISA Affiliates have no material
unfunded liabilities with respect to any such Benefit Plan.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) No Benefit Plan is maintained in connection with any trust described in
Code Section 501(c)(9).

  

  

(i) The Company, the Subsidiaries, and their ERISA Affiliates have no
obligations for post-retirement health and life benefits under any ERISA Plan
(or under any other agreement), except as may be required under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended.

  

  

(j) To the Knowledge of the Company, there have been no prohibited
transactions with respect to any Benefit Plan. No fiduciary (as defined in
Section 3(21) of ERISA) has any liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any
other failure to act or comply in connection with the administration or
investment of the assets of any such Benefit Plan. No action, suit,
proceeding, hearing or investigation with respect to the administration or the
investment of the assets of any Benefit Plan (other than routine claims or
benefits) is pending or, to the Company's Knowledge is threatened. The Company
has no Knowledge of any basis for any such action, suit, proceeding, hearing
or investigation.

  

  

(k) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company, any of the
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Benefit Plan of the Company, any
Subsidiary, or ERISA Affiliate which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the
most recent fiscal year. No complete or partial termination or modification of
any Benefit Plan of the Company, any Subsidiary, or ERISA Affiliate has
occurred or is expected to occur.

  

  

(l) Neither the execution of this Agreement, approval of this Agreement by
Seller nor the consummation of the Transaction will (i) entitle any employees
of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans, (iii) limit or restrict the right of
the Company, ERISA Affiliate or, after the consummation of the Transaction,

regulations and policies of the Company and any applicable Laws, Seller shall,
and shall cause BBHI Holdings, the Company and the Subsidiaries to, (i) afford
Acquiror and its Representatives reasonable access, during regular business

reasonable judgment, would (A) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets
or other proprietary or confidential information of third parties or (B)
violate any obligation of BBHI Holdings, the Company, the Subsidiaries or any
Affiliate of any of the foregoing with respect to confidentiality; provided
that in each case Seller, BBHI Holdings, the Company and the Subsidiaries
shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to permit the disclosure of
such information; it being understood that Acquiror shall reimburse Seller
promptly for out-of-pocket reasonable expenses of Seller, BBHI Holdings, the

pursuant to this Section 5.1(a) shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) For a period of seven years after the Closing Date or, if shorter, the
applicable period specified in Acquiror's document retention policy, Acquiror
shall retain all Books and Records in existence on the Closing Date, and to

subject to Seller reimbursing Acquiror, the Company, the Subsidiaries and any
of their Affiliates for all out of pocket expenses incurred by them in
complying with any such request at the expense of Seller, (i) to inspect and

Section 5.3 Consents; Further Assurances.

  

  

(a) Subject to, and not in limitation of, Section 5.4, Seller, on the one
hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand, shall cooperate and use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill as promptly as practicable the
conditions to Closing in this Agreement to the extent it has the ability to
control the satisfaction of such conditions. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Seller, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand,
shall each, with the reasonable cooperation of the other(s), use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain all Seller Consents and Acquiror
Consents, respectively. If, notwithstanding the exercise of their commercially
reasonable efforts and compliance with this Section 5.3 and Section 5.4,
Seller is unable to obtain one or more of the Seller Consents, Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with Acquiror's efforts to obtain each such Seller
Consent for a period of 12 months following the Closing.

  

  

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall require the expenditure or
payment of any funds (other than in respect of normal and usual attorneys'
fees, filing fees or other normal costs of doing business), the giving of any
other consideration by Acquiror, the Company or the Subsidiaries or any
adjustment to the Final Consideration with respect to seeking any Seller
Consents or Acquiror Consents or any regulatory approvals pursuant to Section
5.4.

  

  

(c) Each party shall execute and deliver such other documents, certificates,
agreements and other writings and to take such other commercially reasonable
actions as may be necessary or desirable to evidence, consummate or implement
expeditiously the Transaction.

  

  

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt by Seller of a
written request by Acquiror, but in no event later than five Business Days
following receipt of such request, Seller shall cause the Company to, at
Acquiror's option, give proper contingent notice under the Indenture of the
Company's intent to redeem the Notes on the Closing Date (or a date that is up
to five Business Days following the Closing Date) and to take all other
necessary and desirable actions in accordance with the Indenture to permit the
redemption of the Notes on such date. Such notice will be subject to the
review and approval of Acquiror, and Seller shall cause the Company to revoke
such notice at the direction of Acquiror upon not less than two Business Days'
written notice. Acquiror shall reimburse Seller for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by Seller or the Company in connection with the
redemption of the Notes and will be responsible for the payment of all
payments with respect to any redemption, including the principal amount of the
Notes (and the accrued interest thereon), any redemption payment with respect
thereto, and any premium to be paid in excess of the principal amount of the
Notes (and the accrued interest thereon) to be redeemed. Acquiror shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Company, the Subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this Section
5.3(d); provided that the foregoing indemnity will not, as to any indemnified
person, apply to liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties to the extent that they are found in
a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from (x) the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of such
indemnified person or (y) Seller's failure to cause the Company to revoke, at
the direction of Acquiror upon not less than two Business Days' written
notice, any redemption notice given in accordance with this Section 5.3(d).

Section 5.4 Regulatory Approvals.

  

  

(a) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, but in any
event no later than February 25, 2013, Seller and Acquiror shall prepare and
file or deliver, or cause to be prepared and filed or delivered, all
applications (including FCC Forms 394 or other appropriate forms) and requests
required to be filed with or delivered to the FCC, any Government Entities or
any other Person that are necessary to obtain the consents of such Government
Entities in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Required Regulatory Approvals"). In addition, Seller shall cause the
Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a renewal or
extension of any Franchise (for a period of at least two (2) years) for which
a valid notice of renewal pursuant to the formal renewal procedures
established by Section 626 of the Communications Act has not been timely
delivered to the appropriate Government Entity. Each party shall promptly file
any additional information requested by any Government Entity as soon as
practicable after receipt of a request for additional information. The parties
shall cooperate fully with each other in all reasonable respects in promptly
seeking to obtain the Required Regulatory Approvals. Each party shall have the
right to review and approve in advance, with such approvals not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, all filings with Government Entities to be
made by the other party in connection with the Transaction. Each party shall
coordinate and cooperate with one another in exchanging such information and
providing such reasonable assistance as may be requested in connection with
such filings. Without the prior consent of Acquiror, none of the Seller, the
Company or any Subsidiary shall agree with any Government Entity to extend or
to toll the time limits applicable to such Government Entity's consideration
of any FCC Form 394 filed with such Government Entity. Each party shall
promptly supply the other with copies of all nonconfidential correspondence,
filings or communications (or memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between such party or its representatives and any Government Entity or members
of their respective staffs with respect to this Agreement or the Transaction.
Seller will, to the extent reasonably practicable, notify Acquiror of all
meetings, hearings and other discussions before or with Government Entities in
connection with the renewal or extension of any Franchise or Governmental
Authorization relating to a Franchise or the granting of an LFA Approval with
respect to any Franchise, such that Acquiror's representatives can participate
to the extent reasonably practicable in such proceedings. No party shall take
in bad faith any action that would have the effect of delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of any Required Regulatory Approvals.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Without limiting Section 5.4(a), as soon as practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, but in any event no later than twenty (20) days
after such execution, (i) Seller and Acquiror shall prepare and file or
deliver, or cause to be prepared and filed or delivered, all applications and
requests required to be filed with or delivered to the FCC that are necessary
to obtain the Required 214 Authorization and (ii) Acquiror shall prepare and
file or deliver, or cause to be prepared and filed or delivered, all
applications and requests required to be filed with or delivered to the
applicable State Regulatory Authorities and other Persons that are necessary
to obtain the Required State Telecommunications Authorizations. The parties
shall share equally the expense of any filing fee with respect to the Required
214 Authorization, and each party shall otherwise bear its own expenses in
connection with the foregoing.

  

  

(c) Each of Seller and Acquiror shall (i) make or cause to be made all filings
required of each of them or any of their Affiliates under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transaction as promptly as practicable and,
in any event, within 30 days after the date of this Agreement in the case of
all filings required under the HSR Act, (ii) comply at the earliest
practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
for additional information, documents, or other materials received by each of
them or any of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates from the FTC, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") or
any other Government Antitrust Entity in respect of such filings or the
Transaction, and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with any such
filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, providing copies
of drafts of all prepared filings to the non-filing parties prior to filing
and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Government
Antitrust Entity under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or
any such transaction. Each such party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to furnish to each other all information requested by the other party
that is reasonably required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to any applicable law in connection with the Transaction. Each such
party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto of any oral communication
with, and provide copies of written communications with, any Government Entity
regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No party hereto shall
independently participate in any formal meeting with any Government Entity in
respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving
the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such Government Entity, the opportunity to attend and
participate. Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to proceedings under
the HSR Act, other Antitrust Laws or other applicable Law. Any party may, if
it reasonably deems it advisable and necessary, designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other parties under this Section 5.4 as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of
the recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from
the source of the materials.

  

  

(d) Each of Acquiror and Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Government
Antitrust Entity with respect to the Transaction under the HSR Act, the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal or state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or
judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade (collectively, the "Antitrust Laws"). Each of Acquiror and Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as may be
required to cause the expiration of the waiting or notice periods under the
HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transaction as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Seller and Acquiror shall each be responsible for and pay one-half of all
mandatory and generally applicable transfer and filing fees imposed by a
Government Entity as a condition to processing or giving any consents or
notices described in this Section 5.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
in no event shall either party be required to pay any fees and expenses of
counsel, accountants, agents and other Representatives of the applicable
Government Entity related thereto.

  

  

Section 5.5 Tax Matters

  

  

(a) Seller and Acquiror shall each be responsible for and pay one-half of all
federal, state, local or foreign or other excise, sales, use, value added,
transfer (including real property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary,
filing, recordation and other similar taxes and fees that may be imposed or
assessed as a result of the Transaction, together with any interest, additions
or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of such
additions or penalties ("Transfer Taxes"). Any Tax Returns that must be filed
in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared by the party primarily or
customarily responsible under applicable Law for filing such Tax Returns, and
such party will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Tax
Returns to the other party (or, in the case of the Company, to Seller) at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be
filed. Acquiror and Seller shall cooperate in the timely completion and filing
of all such Tax Returns.

  

  

(b) Acquiror shall have no authority to amend any Tax Return of the Company or
a Subsidiary for any taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
without Seller's prior consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).

  

  

(c) At or before the Closing, Seller shall deliver a duly executed certificate
of non-foreign status in the form and manner that complies with Section 1445
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

  

  

(d) Following the Closing, Acquiror shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to:

  

  

(i) Continue to diligently prosecute in good faith its claim for Tax refunds
payable in respect of the Montana Tax Disputes, including refunds of the
Closing Tax Protest Payments, until the issuance of a final, non-appealable
order with respect to all claims made by the parties to the Montana Tax
Dispute; and

  

  

(ii) collect all refunds of the Closing Tax Protest Payments (including
interest thereon from the applicable payment date to the Closing Time at the
statutory rate applicable to tax refunds in Montana) as of such time finally
determined to be due and owing to the Company and the Subsidiaries with
respect to the Montana Tax Disputes, and remit all amounts collected in
respect of the Closing Tax Protest Payments (including any payments of
interest received relating to such refunds) to Seller within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt of such refund.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

The Company and the Subsidiaries shall prosecute the Montana Tax Disputes in
accordance with this Section 5.5(d) with counsel selected by Acquiror, the
fees and expenses of which shall be paid in full by the Company. Seller shall
nonetheless be entitled to participate in (but not control) any proceeding
related to the Montana Tax Disputes, provided that Seller shall bear its own
costs and expenses in participating in such proceeding. Acquiror shall cause
the Company and the Subsidiaries not to settle or compromise any claim
relating to the Montana Tax Disputes, if the effect of such settlement or
compromise would result in less than a full refund of the Closing Tax Protest
Payments (including interest thereon from the applicable payment date to the
Closing Time at the statutory rate applicable to tax refunds in Montana) for
any period or portion of any period ending prior to the Closing Time that is
the subject of the Montana Tax Disputes, unless Seller consents in writing to
such settlement or compromise (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

  

  

Section 5.6 Employees.

  

  

(a) The Employees who are employed immediately prior to the Closing and who
continue employment with the Company or any Subsidiary following the Closing
Date are hereinafter referred to as the "Continuing Employees."

  

  

(b) Following the Closing,

  

  

(i) Acquiror shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to, for the six-
month period immediately after the Closing Date, provide to each Continuing
Employee overall compensation and benefits consistent with and to the same
extent as Acquiror's similarly situated employees and their dependents (with
the special rules as provided in (iii) and (iv) below);

  

  

(ii) Acquiror shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to, perform their
respective obligations under any applicable employment Contracts of the

of the Company and the Subsidiaries;

  

  

(iii) the service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor employer) prior to the Closing shall be
treated as service with Acquiror and the Subsidiaries for purposes of each
employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies and arrangements of
Acquiror or its Affiliates (the "Acquiror Plans") (including vacation, paid
time-off and severance plans) in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate and participates in after the Closing, including for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting, but not for the purpose of determining
any benefit accruals;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) for purposes of each Acquiror Plan in which any Continuing Employee or
his or her eligible dependents is eligible to participate and participates in
after the Closing, Acquiror shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to
(A) waive any pre-existing condition, exclusion, or waiting period to the
extent such condition, exclusion, or waiting period was satisfied or waived
under the comparable Benefit Plan of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries as
of the Closing and (B) provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or
similar payments made or incurred prior to the Closing under the comparable
Benefit Plan of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries for the plan year in
which the Closing occurs;

  

  

(v) If, following the Closing, Acquiror maintains a tax-qualified 401(k)
retirement plan for its employees, Acquiror and Seller shall take all actions
necessary to permit, beginning as soon as practicable following the Closing,
each Continuing Employee to effect a rollover from Seller's 401(k) plan (or,
at Acquiror's option, a direct transfer from a trust established under
Seller's 401(k) plan to a trust established under Acquiror's 401(k) plan),
including notes evidencing any outstanding plan loans from Seller's 401(k)
plan, to an account under Acquiror's 401(k) plan;

  

  

(vi) Seller will retain full responsibility and liability for offering and
providing continuation coverage of any qualified beneficiary who is covered by
a group health plan sponsored or contributed to by the Seller and who has
experienced a qualifying event or is receiving continuation coverage prior to
the Closing Date. As used in this Section 5.6(b) continuation coverage,
qualified beneficiary, group health plan, and qualifying event all shall have
the meanings given such terms under Section 4980B of the Code; and

  

  

(vii) if, at any time within 12 months after Closing, any of Acquiror, the
Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Acquiror, the Company or such Subsidiary
shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.6(b).

  

  

(c) Acquiror shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, BBHI Holdings,
their respective shareholders, directors, officers and employees
(collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and against any Losses imposed on the
Indemnitees directly or indirectly relating to or arising out of the
termination of employment, or the wrongful discharge, including constructive
discharge by Acquiror or its Affiliates, of any Continuing Employee occurring
after the Closing with respect to any Continuing Employee.

  

  

(d) Acquiror shall be responsible for providing or discharging any and all
notifications, benefits and liabilities to Continuing Employees and
governmental authorities required by the WARN Act or by any other applicable
Law relating to plant closings or employee separations or severance pay that
are required to be provided occurring after the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Prior to making any written or oral communications to the directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries pertaining to
material compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the Transaction,
Seller shall cause the Company to provide Acquiror with a copy of the intended
communication. Acquiror shall have a reasonable period of time to review and
comment on the communication and consider such comments in good faith.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 5.6, Acquiror shall either
cause the Continuing Employees to continue to participate in the existing
Benefit Plans or, in its sole discretion, cause the Continuing Employees to
participate in the Acquiror Plans. Furthermore, nothing contained in this
Section 5.6 shall require or imply that the employment of the Employees or the
Continuing Employees will continue for any particular period of time following
the Closing. This Section 5.6 is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to
confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any
agreement of employment with any Person or to otherwise create any third-party
beneficiary hereunder, or to be interpreted as an amendment to any plan of
Acquiror or any Affiliate of Acquiror.

  

  

Section 5.7 Contact with Customers, Supplier and Other Business Relations.
Prior to the Closing, except as otherwise expressly contemplated hereby,
Acquiror and its Representatives shall not have any contact or otherwise
communicate with the employees, customers, suppliers and other business
relations of the Company and the Subsidiaries about the Company or the
Subsidiaries or their respective assets, properties, operations or Businesses
in connection with the Transaction without the Company's prior consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

  

Section 5.8 Real Estate Matters. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
Acquiror and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to provide to
Acquiror current commitments to issue title insurance policies on the 2006
ALTA owner's form so that Acquiror may receive, at Acquiror's expense and to
the extent available in the respective jurisdiction, an ALTA owner's policy or
policies of title insurance from a nationally recognized title insurance
company reasonably acceptable to Acquiror (the "Title Company") insuring title
to such of the Owned Real Property that Acquiror shall designate in writing,
subject only to Permitted Encumbrances. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
Acquiror so that Acquiror may receive, at Acquiror's expense, a current
ALTA/ASCM survey of each such parcel of Owned Real Property and, where the
Company is the sole tenant of the Leased Real Property, such Leased Real
Property. Each such survey shall be certified to (i) Acquiror, (ii) the
Company or applicable Subsidiary, and (iii) the Title Company.

  

  

Section 5.9 Environmental Site Assessments. Seller acknowledges and agrees
that Acquiror may commission, at Acquiror's sole cost and expense, a Phase I
environmental site assessment of the Owned Real Property. Seller will comply
with any reasonable request for information made by Acquiror or its agents in
connection with any such investigation, but in no event will the Company be
required under this Section 5.9 to disclose any materials constituting
attorney-client privileged communications. Upon request by Acquiror, Seller
will cause the Company to afford Acquiror and its agents or representatives
access to the Owned Real Property at reasonable times and in a reasonable
manner in connection with any such investigation; provided that Acquiror will
not unreasonably interfere with the Company's or its Subsidiaries' use and
operation of the Owned Real Property. Should Acquiror commission such an
investigation, such investigation will have no effect upon the representations
and warranties made by Seller to Acquiror under this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 5.10 Notification. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, Seller shall give prompt notice to Acquiror, and Acquiror shall give
prompt notice to Seller, (a) of any notice or other communication received by
such party from any Government Entity in connection with the Transaction or
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the Transaction, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be
material to Seller, the Company or Acquiror, (b) of any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced relating to or otherwise
affecting such party of any of its Affiliates which relate to the Transaction,
and (c) if such party becomes aware of any fact, circumstance or event that
would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3 not to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it
is understood and agreed that neither the delivery or non-delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.10 nor any disclosures provided thereby
shall affect any of the rights, remedies or obligations of the parties
hereunder.

  

  

Section 5.11 Transition Matters. 
 

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, each party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to negotiate in good faith the schedules to, and Provider Fees
provided for in, the Transition Services Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof. To the extent that the Parties are unable to reach such
agreement, the applicable provisions of the Transition Services Agreement
shall control from and after the Closing, subject to amendment in accordance
with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that if there are any disputes with respect to the Transition
Services Agreement prior to the Closing, such disputes shall not affect the
obligations of the Parties to effect the Closing and shall be resolved in
accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Acquiror acknowledges that Seller has the absolute and exclusive
proprietary right to the trademark "OPTIMUM", other "OPTIMUM" inclusive
trademarks and designs and logos associated therewith currently used by the
Business (collectively, the "Names") and that none of the rights thereto or
goodwill represented thereby or pertaining thereto are being transferred
hereby or in connection herewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period
of 360 days following the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries may
continue to operate the Systems using the Names, including (i) use of the
phrase "Optimum is now Charter," (ii) use of any Name affixed to vehicles,
signage or other equipment which are used by any of them in Business as of the
Closing Date, (iii) use of any printed purchase orders or sales, maintenance
or license agreements that bear a Name (as limited by any existing agreements
the Seller or any of its Affiliates may have with third parties) until the
supplies thereof existing on the Closing Date have been exhausted, and (iv)
use of any printed billing statements that bear a Name (such billing
statements and purchase orders and sales, maintenance and license agreements
are collectively referred to herein as "Forms"); provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing with respect to any advertising, marketing,
packaging, displays, merchandise or other promotional materials ("Promotional
Materials") which are used by the Company or any Subsidiary in the Business as
of the Closing Date the Company and the Subsidiaries shall have the right to
use such Promotional Materials only: (i) for a period of 60 days following the
Closing with respect to mass marketing Promotional Materials (such as
television advertising and mass mailings) and 180 days for all other
Promotional Materials, (ii) in the exact form as such Promotional Materials
exist on the Closing Date, (iii) to the extent that the Company or Subsidiary
using such Promotional Materials has not modified the products or services of
the Business in any way which would render the use of such Promotional
Materials inaccurate or misleading in any respect, and (iv) provided the
Company and the Subsidiaries shall mark such materials as necessary in order
to indicate clearly and prominently to indicate that neither the Acquiror nor
any of its Affiliates is affiliated with the Seller or any of its Affiliates.
With respect to Forms, within 60 days after the Closing Date the Company and
the Subsidiaries shall sticker or otherwise mark such documents as necessary
in order to indicate clearly that neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates
are a party to such documents or affiliated with the Seller or any of its
Affiliates. From and after the expiration of the period for use applicable to
Promotional Materials or Forms, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall cease
to use any such Promotional Materials or Forms. With respect to the other uses
of the Names permitted above, from and after the 360-day period permitted
above the Company and the Subsidiaries shall delete or cover (as by
stickering) any Name from any item included in inventory that bears Name and
take such other actions as may be necessary or advisable clearly and
prominently to indicate that neither the Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates is
affiliated with the Seller or any of its Affiliates. If Acquiror determines
that it wishes the Company and the Subsidiaries to use any Promotional
Materials or Forms to which the applicable period provided above applies for a
duration longer than such period or to use any other Promotional Materials or
Forms or to create new Promotional Materials or Forms incorporating the Names
in a manner exceeding the scope of the rights granted herein, Acquiror shall
notify Seller and the parties shall negotiate in good faith the terms of a
trademark license granting to the Company and the Subsidiaries such rights for
an agreed-upon term and otherwise on terms and conditions mutually acceptable
to Acquiror and Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, the execution and delivery
of any such trademark license shall not be a condition to Closing or otherwise
affect the obligations of the parties to consummate the Transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.11(b) shall require
the Acquiror to remove or discontinue using any Name that is affixed as of the
Closing Date to converters or other items in or to be used in consumer homes
or properties, or as are used in a similar fashion making such removal or
discontinuation impracticable.

  

  

Section 5.12 No Solicitation. Seller (and its directors, officers, employees,
representatives and agents) shall not directly or indirectly, (i) offer the
assets of the Company, the Systems or the Business for sale, (ii) solicit,
encourage or entertain offers for such assets of the Company, Systems or
Business, (iii) initiate negotiations or discussions for the sale of such
assets of the Company, Systems or Business or (iv) make information about such
assets of the Company, Systems or Business available to any third party in
connection with the possible sale of such assets of the Company, Systems or
Business prior to the Closing Date or the date this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 5.13 Cooperation as to Pending Litigation. Subject to Section 5.5(d),
with respect to the Company's continued defense or prosecution of any
litigation or legal proceeding with respect to the Systems that relates to the
period prior to the Closing Time, Seller shall cooperate with and assist the
Company and Acquiror following the Closing, upon reasonable request, by making
witnesses available and providing all information in its possession (including
access to employees with information regarding such proceedings and access to
books and records that may relate to the proceedings) that the Company and
Acquiror may reasonably require in connection with such litigation or legal
proceedings or in response to any complaint, claim, inquiry, order or
requirements of any Government Entity or other third party.

(a) Representations and Warranties. Each of the representations and warranties
of Seller contained in this Agreement (other than the representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in the second sentence of Section 3.1(b), the
second sentence of Section 3.1(c), Section 3.2, Section 3.5 and Section 3.25
(collectively, the "Fundamental Representations")) shall have been true and
correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and shall be true and
correct in all respects as of and as though made on the Closing Date (except
for any such representation and warranty that is expressly made as of a
specified earlier date, which shall be true and correct in all respects as of
such specified earlier date) in each case without giving effect to any
"Material Adverse Effect", "material" or other materiality qualification,
limitation or exception contained therein other than any failures to be so
true and correct that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
Fundamental Representation shall have been true and correct in all material
respects as of the date of this Agreement and shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of and as though made on the Closing Date;

representation or warranty were made as of such date; provided that for
purposes of the foregoing, the representations and warranties shall be deemed

inaccuracies as of the applicable date would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Acquiror's ability to consummate the Transaction.

  

  

(b) Covenants. Each of the covenants and agreements of Acquiror to be
performed on or prior to the Closing shall have been performed in all material
respects.

ARTICLE VIII.

  

TERMINATION

 

  

  

Section 8.1 Termination by Mutual Consent. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing by written agreement of Seller and Acquiror.

  

  

Section 8.2 Termination by Seller or Acquiror.

  

  

(a) Acquiror, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, may terminate
this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing by giving written notice of
termination to the other(s), if: (i) the Closing shall not have occurred by
the date which is six (6) months following the date hereof (the "End Date"),
so long as the party proposing to terminate has not breached in any material
respect any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement in any manner
that shall have proximately caused (such breaching party, a "Proximate Cause
Party") the failure of the Closing to so occur; provided, however, that if any
of the Regulatory Conditions are not satisfied on the End Date, then Seller or
Acquiror shall be entitled to extend the End Date to the date which is nine
(9) months following the date of this Agreement so long as the party proposing
to so extend the End Date is not a Proximate Cause Party with respect to the
failure of any of the Regulatory Conditions to be satisfied on or prior to the
End Date, or (ii) any Law permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the Transaction shall become final and non-
appealable, so long as the party proposing to terminate is not a Proximate
Cause Party with respect to the issuance, existence or effectiveness of such
Law.

  

  

(b) Seller may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing, by
written notice to Acquiror, if (i) there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Acquiror herein or any
such representation or warranty shall have become untrue as of and as though
made on any date after the date of this Agreement, (ii) such breach or untruth
would cause any of the closing conditions in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) not to
be satisfied (assuming, in the case of any such untruth, that such date was
the Closing Date) and (iii) such breach or untruth is not curable or, if
curable, is not cured by Acquiror within thirty (30) days after written notice
thereof is given by Seller to Acquiror.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Acquiror may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing, by
written notice to Seller, if (i) there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Seller herein or any
such representation or warranty shall have become untrue as of and as though
made on any date after the date of this Agreement, (ii) such breach or untruth
would cause any of the closing conditions in Section 6.2(a) or (b) not to be
satisfied (assuming, in the case of any such untruth, that such date was the
Closing Date) and (iii) such breach or untruth is not curable or, if curable,
is not cured by Seller within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is
given by Acquiror to Seller.

  

  

(d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and at the time
of such termination all of the conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) have
been satisfied other than any of the Regulatory Conditions set forth in
Section 6.1(a), Section 6.1(c), and Section 6.1(d) (a "Regulatory
Termination"), then Acquiror shall promptly, but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid
to Seller by wire transfer of same day funds (it being understood that in no
event shall Acquiror be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion) an amount equal to $50,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"). The parties
acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2(d) are an
integral part of the Transaction and that without these agreements the parties
would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if Acquiror fails to
promptly pay the Termination Fee due pursuant to this Section 8.2(d) and, in
order to obtain such payment, Seller commences a suit that results in a
judgment against Acquiror for the Termination Fee, Acquiror shall pay to
Seller its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys'
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the Termination
Fee from the date the Termination Fee was required to be made through the date
of payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on such required
payment date (such costs, expenses, interest and the Termination Fee
collectively, the "Termination Payments"). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement but without limiting Seller's ability to enforce
its other rights hereunder prior to a Regulatory Termination, Seller's right
to receive the Termination Payments from Acquiror pursuant to this Section
8.2(d) shall, from and after a Regulatory Termination, be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Seller and its Affiliates against Acquiror, its
Representatives, the former, current and future equity holders, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members,
managers, counsel, general or limited partners or assignees of Acquiror or its
Representatives and any former, current or future stockholder, controlling
person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member,
manager, Affiliate, agent or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively,
the "Buyer Entities") for any loss suffered as a result of any breach by
Acquiror of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein or the failure of the Transaction to be consummated, and upon payment
of the Termination Payments, none of the Buyer Entities shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transaction. If, after a Regulatory Termination occurs, Seller or any of its
Affiliates asserts in any litigation or other proceeding that (A) the
provisions of this Section 8.2(d) limiting the liability of the Buyer Entities
for the matters described herein to the Termination Payments or the other
provisions of this Section 8.2(d) are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in
whole or in part, (B) Acquiror is liable for payments in excess of the
Termination Payment or any other Buyer Entity has any liability hereunder or
(C) any theory of liability against any Buyer Entity with respect to this
Agreement or the Transaction other than Acquiror's obligation to pay the
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2(d), then (i) the obligations of
Acquiror under this Section 8.2(d) shall terminate ab initio and be null and
void, (ii) if Acquiror has previously made any payments pursuant to this
Section 8.2(d), it shall be entitled to recover such payments and (iii)
neither Acquiror nor any of the Buyer Entities shall have any liability to
Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to this Agreement or the
Transaction.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8.3 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 8.1 or Section 8.2, this Agreement shall thereafter
become void and have no effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability
to the other party or parties hereto or their respective Affiliates, or their
respective directors, officers or employees, except for the expense
reimbursement obligations of the Parties hereto contained in Section 5.1, the
indemnification obligations of Acquiror contained in Section 5.3(d) and the
obligations of the parties hereto contained in Section 8.2(d), this Section
8.3 and in Section 9.1, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8 and 9.9 (and any related
definitional provisions set forth in Article I); provided, that nothing in
this Section 8.3 shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement that arose prior to such termination.

Section 9.2 Amendment; Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended
or waived only if such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the
case of an amendment, by Acquiror and Seller, or in the case of a waiver, by
the party or parties against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege.

  

  

Section 9.3 No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. No party
to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise, without
the prior written consent of the other party hereto, except that Acquiror may
assign any and all of its rights under this Agreement to CCI, or a wholly
owned, direct or indirect, subsidiary of CCI, without the prior written
consent of Seller (but no such assignment shall relieve Acquiror of any of its
obligations hereunder). Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person other than Acquiror, Seller, the
Indemnitees and their respective successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, BBHI
Holdings shall be an express and intended third party beneficiary for the
purposes of Section 2.1, Section 2.3 and Section 2.4 of this Agreement;
provided, further, however, that the Acquiror's financing sources and their
respective current, former or future equity holders, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers,
counsel, general or limited partners or assignees of any of the foregoing
shall be third party beneficiaries of Sections 8.2(d) and 9.9 and this Section
9.3.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all Schedules,
Exhibits and Annexes hereto) contains the entire agreement among the parties
hereto and thereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with
respect to such matters, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

  

  

Section 9.5 Enforcement

  

  

(a) Irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur if the parties hereto do not perform
the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as
are required of such parties hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Each
party shall be, entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other parties
hereto and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which each such party is entitled at law or
in equity. No party will oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such other order
or injunction.

  

  

(b) To the extent a party brings any Action to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly
available to such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the End Date
shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such
Action is pending, plus twenty Business Days, or (ii) if such other time
period established by the court presiding over such Action.

  

  

Section 9.6 Public Disclosure

  

  

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except as may be
required to comply with the requirements of any applicable Law and the rules
and regulations of any stock exchange upon which the securities of one of the
parties or any of their respective Affiliates is listed (on which each party
shall give the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment), no
press release or similar public announcement or communication shall be made or
caused to be made relating to this Agreement unless specifically approved in
advance by Acquiror and Seller.

  

  

Section 9.7 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein this
Agreement, regardless of whether the Closing occurs, all costs, expenses and
Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction shall be
borne by the party incurring such costs and expenses or the party upon which
such costs, expenses or Taxes are imposed by applicable Law.

  

  

Section 9.8 Schedules. The disclosure of any matter in any Section of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to be a disclosure for purposes of any other Section of this Agreement to
which the application of such disclosure to such Section is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure, but shall not be deemed to
constitute an admission by Seller or Acquiror or to otherwise imply that any
such matter is material for the purposes of this Agreement, unless the
inclusion of such matter in such Disclosure Schedule is required to make the
representation true.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.9 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum;
Waiver of Trial by Jury. THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES
OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action
or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the Transaction, exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery or
in the event (but only in the event) that such court does not have
jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware (the "Chosen Courts"), and solely in
connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the Transaction (i)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii)
waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the
Chosen Courts, and (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an
inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto agrees that
it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Acquiror's financing
sources and their respective current, former or future equity holders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates,
members, managers, counsel, general or limited partners or assignees of any of
the foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of their
performance of their financing obligations to the Acquiror in connection with
the acquisition contemplated by this Agreement, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof). Each party that does not maintain a registered
agent in Delaware hereby irrevocably designates Corporation Service Company as
its agent and attorney-in-fact for the acceptance of service of process and
making an appearance on its behalf in any such claim or proceeding and for the
taking of all such acts as may be necessary or appropriate in order to confer
jurisdiction over it before the Chosen Courts and each party hereto stipulates
that such consent and appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.
Each party hereto irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any
