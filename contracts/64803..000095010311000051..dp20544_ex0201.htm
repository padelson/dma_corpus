ARTICLE II

  

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  

  

Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company or of any
membership interests of Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Membership Interests. Each membership interest of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become one fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of
Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, owned by the Company or any
of its wholly owned Subsidiaries or by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub) immediately before the Effective Time (collectively,
the "Excluded Shares") shall be canceled automatically and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be paid for those Excluded Shares.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Common Stock.

  

  

(i) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall be converted into the right
to receive (A) from the Company, subject to the last sentence of Section 8.8,
one (1) (the "Newco Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Newco Common Stock (the "Split-Off Consideration") and
(B) from Parent, the Per Share Merger Consideration in cash, without interest
(clauses (A) and (B), and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco
Common Stock to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.2(j),
collectively, the "Closing Consideration").

  

  

(ii) All shares of Common Stock that have been converted pursuant to Section
2.1(c)(i) shall be canceled automatically and shall cease to exist, and the
holders of (i) certificates which immediately before the Effective Time
represented such shares or (ii) shares represented by book-entry shall cease
to have any rights with respect to those shares, other than the right to
receive the Closing Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest.

  

  

(d) Conversion of Preferred Stock.

  


 

  

(i) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the

Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to
the Closing Consideration for each share of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of such share of Series A Preferred Stock immediately before the
Effective Time.

  

  

(ii) All shares of Series A Preferred Stock that have been converted pursuant
to Section 2.1(d)(i) shall be canceled automatically and shall cease to exist,
and the holders of certificates which immediately before the Effective Time
represented such shares (together with the certificates which represented
shares of Common Stock, the "Certificates") or shares represented by book-
entry (together with the shares of Common Stock represented by book-entry,
"Book-Entry Shares") shall cease to have any rights with respect to those
shares, other than the right to receive the Closing Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.

  

  

(e) Equitable Adjustment. If at any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, reorganization, stock split (including a reverse stock

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution is declared with a record date during such
period, the Closing Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change.

  


 

  

Section 2.2 Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.

  

  

(a) Exchange Agent. Not less than ten Business Days before the Effective Time,
Parent shall (i) select a bank or trust company, satisfactory to the Company
in its reasonable discretion, to act as the exchange agent in the Merger (the
"Exchange Agent") and (ii) enter into an exchange agent agreement with the
Exchange Agent in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company.
Parent and Newco shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of the
Exchange Agent as set forth in the Separation Agreement.

  

  

(b) Exchange Fund. At or before the Effective Time, for the benefit of the
holders of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock (i) the Company shall
provide to the Exchange Agent certificates representing the shares of Newco
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.1(d) and (ii)
Parent shall provide to the Exchange Agent cash in an amount sufficient for
the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable under
Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.1(d). Such shares of Newco Common Stock and funds
provided to the Exchange Agent are collectively referred to as the "Exchange
Fund."

  

  

(c) Exchange Procedures.

  

  

(i) Letter of Transmittal. As promptly as practicable but in no event later
than two Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a share of Common Stock or
Series A Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i) or Section
2.1(d)(i), (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form, specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such holder's shares
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates to the Exchange Agent
or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set
forth in the letter of transmittal and (B) instructions for surrendering such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  

  

(ii) Surrender of Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of a Book-Entry
Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed
letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of that Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive, and the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange
therefor, the Closing Consideration deliverable in respect of the number of
shares formerly evidenced by that Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Any
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be canceled
immediately. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Closing Consideration
deliverable upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  

  

(iii) Unregistered Transferees. If any Closing Consideration is to be
delivered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

surrendered Certificate is registered, then the Closing Consideration may be
delivered to such a transferee so long as (A) the surrendered Certificate is
accompanied by all documents required by Parent to evidence and effect that
transfer and (B) the Person requesting such delivery (1) pays any applicable
transfer Taxes or (2) establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and
the Exchange Agent that any such transfer Taxes have already been paid or are
not applicable.

  

  

(iv) No Other Rights. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section
2.2(c), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Closing
Consideration. Any Closing Consideration delivered upon the surrender of any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been delivered in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
and the shares of Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable,
formerly represented by it.

  

  

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate is lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver, in exchange for such affidavit
claiming such Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Closing
Consideration to such Person in respect of the shares of Common Stock or
Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such Certificate.

  

  

(e) No Further Transfers. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock that were
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time.

  

  

(f) Required Withholding. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise deliverable under this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the "Code"), or any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having
been delivered to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding
was made for all purposes under this Agreement.

  

  

(g) No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Newco or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
portion of the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, that such

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of
a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Ratings Service, respectively, or
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual funds
investing in such assets. Any such investment shall be for the benefit, and at
the risk, of Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such
investment shall be for the benefit of Parent; provided, that no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Per Share Merger Consideration
deliverable to former shareholders of the Company, and Parent shall promptly
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide,
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the former
shareholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses to the extent
necessary to satisfy the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this Article II.

  

  

(i) Termination of Exchange Fund.

  

  

(i) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered by the Exchange Agent (A) in the case of the Fractional Shares Fund
and shares of Newco Common Stock deposited in the Exchange Fund by the
Company, to Newco and (B) in the case of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund
(other than the Fractional Shares Fund), to Parent, in each case upon demand.

  

  

(ii) Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall look only to (A) Newco for,
and Newco shall remain liable for, delivery of the Split-Off Consideration and
(B) Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, delivery of the Per Share
Merger Consideration, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Article II.

  

  

(j) No Fractional Shares.

  

  

(i) No fractional shares of Newco Common Stock shall be delivered upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  

  

(ii) In the event that the Company amends the Newco Exchange Ratio in
accordance with Section 8.8 such that fractional shares of Newco Common Stock
would be delivered to holders of Common Stock, as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, Newco and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to aggregate all fractional share interests of Newco Common Stock, rounded
down to the nearest whole share, and deliver such fractional share interests
to its designated broker for sale on the open market at the then prevailing
market prices, which sale or sales shall be completed as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time. Newco and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to, upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale or sales from
such designated broker, distribute the proceeds of such sale or sales to the
holders of surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in lieu of fractional
shares of Newco Common Stock. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have
been distributed to

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the former holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent
shall hold such proceeds in an account for the benefit of such former holders
(the "Fractional Shares Fund"). The portion of the Fractional Shares Fund (net
of any brokerage commissions retained by the Exchange Agent's designated
broker) to which each former holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled, if any, shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the
aggregate proceeds comprising the Fractional Shares Fund (net of any brokerage
commissions retained by the Exchange Agent's designated broker) by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interests in
Newco Common Stock to which such holder is entitled (after taking into account
all shares of Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder
(including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock)) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interest in Newco Common Stock (after taking into account all
shares of Common Stock held at the Effective Time by all holders (including
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
Stock)) to which all former holders of shares of Common Stock and Series A
Preferred Stock are entitled. Cash payments are being made to holders of
Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock in lieu of fractional shares of
Newco Common Stock for the purpose of saving Newco the expense and
inconvenience of issuing and transferring fractional shares. Such cash
payments do not represent separately bargained-for consideration.

  

  

Section 2.3 Part D Options; Part D Employee Restricted Shares; and Part D
Employee Performance Shares.

  

  

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts so that, at the Effective
Time, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time and held by a Part D Employee or Former Part D Employee (as such term is
defined in the Separation Agreement) (each, a "Part D Option"), whether or not
vested and exercisable, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Part D Option, shall be
cancelled and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive an
amount from Parent in cash, without interest, that is equal to the excess, if
any, of (i) the sum of (x) the Per Share Merger Consideration and (y) the
value of the Split-Off Consideration (which shall be deemed for such purpose
to be equal to the product of (A) the closing price of one share of Newco
Common Stock on NASDAQ or the national securities exchange on which the shares
of Newco Common Stock are traded on the first full day of trading after the
Closing Date and (B) the Newco Exchange Ratio (the product of (A) and (B), the
"Split-Off Consideration Value" and the sum of (x) and (y), the "Pre-Split-Off
Common Stock Value") over (ii) the per share exercise or purchase price of the
applicable Part D Option (the "Exercise Price"), multiplied by the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock in respect of such Part D Option immediately
before the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Exercise Price
of a Part D Option is equal to or exceeds the Pre-Split-Off Common Stock
Value, such Part D Option shall be cancelled and terminated at the Effective
Time without payment or consideration therefor and the holder of such Part D
Option shall have no rights whatsoever with respect thereto.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Each Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a Part D Employee or Former Part D Employee (each,
a "Part D Employee Restricted Share") shall, at the Effective Time, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
(i) the Per Share Merger Consideration plus (ii) the Split-Off Consideration
Value, on the same dates and subject to the same conditions on vesting as
applied to the Part D Employee Restricted Share immediately prior the
Effective Time, without any crediting of interest for the period from the
Effective Time until vesting; provided, that if the Part D Employee's
employment with Parent and its Affiliates is terminated other than for "Cause"
or by the Part D Employee for "Good Reason," as such terms are defined on
Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, then such vesting shall be
accelerated to the date of such termination (the "Converted Restricted Share
Award").

  

  

(c) Each Earned Performance Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a Part D Employee or Former Part D Employee (each,
a "Part D Employee Performance Share") shall, at the Effective Time, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
(i) the Per Share Merger Consideration plus (ii) the Split-Off Consideration
Value, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) on the first to occur of (x) the
first anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs and (y) the
date the Part D Employee's employment with Parent and its Affiliates is
terminated other than for "Cause" or by the Part D Employee for "Good Reason,"
as such terms are defined on Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
without any crediting of interest for the period from the Effective Time until
vesting (the "Converted Performance Share Award"). The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts so that, at the Effective Time, each Performance Share
held by a Part D Employee or a Former Part D Employee that is not an Earned
Performance Share is cancelled without consideration being due therefor.

  

  

(d) As of and following the Effective Time, the Company shall retain all
Liabilities in respect of the Part D Employee Restricted Shares, the Part D
Employee Performance Shares and the Part D Options.

  

  

(e) Parent and the Company shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, take such action (including adopting, if appropriate, equity award plans)
as is necessary or appropriate to effect the foregoing.

  

  

(f) Except as described in clauses (a) through (e) above, all terms of the
Part D Employee Performance Shares and the Part D Employee Restricted Shares
as in existence on the Effective Time, including, in the case of the Part D
Employee Restricted Shares, the vesting schedule and restrictions on transfer,
shall continue to apply to the Converted Performance Share Awards and the
Converted Restricted Share Awards, as applicable.

  

  

(g) In addition to the payments made pursuant to this Section 2.3, Parent
shall pay all accrued dividends and other distributions (including dividend
equivalents) in respect of each Part D Employee Restricted Share and Part D
Employee Performance Share with a record date prior to the Effective Time
which have

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time
as set forth on Section 2.3(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Such payments
shall be made to the holders thereof simultaneously with the payments made in
respect of the Converted Restricted Share Awards and Converted Performance
Share Awards pursuant to Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.3(c), respectively.

  

  

(h) Any payments made to Part D Employees pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall
be reduced by any income or employment tax withholding required under (A) the
Code, (B) any applicable state, local or foreign tax Law, and (C) any other
applicable Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld and paid to
the appropriate Governmental Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as
having been paid to the holder of the applicable award, as applicable, for all
purposes under this Agreement.

  

  

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, the treatment of each Company Option,
Restricted Share and Performance Share not held by a Part D Employee or a
Former Part D Employee is set forth in Article VII of the Separation
Agreement.

Subsidiaries since formation of the Company. Except (i) as set forth in the
corresponding sections of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent before the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure

in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or other legal
entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification
is necessary, except where failures to be so qualified or in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

true and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "Company

Section 3.3 Governmental Authorizations. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Split-Off Agreements by the Company and
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby do not and will not require any consent, approval or other

(e) any filings with and approvals of a national securities exchange or The
Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("NASDAQ") to permit the shares of Newco Common Stock

national securities exchange, or approved for quotation on NASDAQ, as the case
may be, in either case subject to official notice of issuance;

  

  

(f) the pre-merger notification required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act");

Material Adverse Effect.

warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 4.5(c) are true and
correct, the Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and the Split-Off Agreements and, subject (in the case of
this Agreement) to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company Board at a

Agreement and the Split-Off Agreements by the Company and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not (a)
contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any
provision of the organizational or governing documents of (i) any of the
Company or (ii) any of its Subsidiaries, (b) assuming that the representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 4.5(c) are true
and correct, contravene or conflict with, or result

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

in any material violation or breach of, any Law applicable to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or by which any assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are bound, assuming that all Governmental Authorizations
described in Section 3.3 have been obtained or made, (c) result in any

Company's periodic reports under the Exchange Act is made known to the
Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by
others within the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Company's

evaluation of its principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer prior to the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

date of this Agreement, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of
the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' ability to record, process, summarize and report financial

material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company internal controls.

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(a) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Department of State of
the State of New York;

(e) compliance with the CMS Notice Requirements;

  

  

(f) the Required Consents; and

Section 4.3 Authorization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary
power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. A duly authorized committee of
the board of directors of Parent has unanimously adopted resolutions approving
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The sole
member of Merger Sub has approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the
consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub. This Agreement constitutes a
legal, valid and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable
against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms (except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditor's rights, and to general equitable
principles). No vote or consent of the shareholders of Parent is required by
any applicable Law, or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents of Parent in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 4.4 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger

provision of the organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any
Law applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any assets of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries ("Parent Assets") are bound, assuming that
all Governmental Authorizations described in Section 3.3 and Section 4.2 have
been obtained or made;

  

  

(c) result in any violation or breach of, or constitute a default (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) under, any Contracts to which Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any Parent Assets are bound
(collectively, "Parent Contracts"), other than as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect; or

  

  

(d) require any consent, approval or other authorization of, or filing with or
notification to, any Person under any Parent Contracts, other than as, if not
obtained, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

owned Subsidiaries. Merger Sub has no outstanding option, warrant, right or
any other agreement pursuant to which any Person other than Parent may acquire
any equity security of Merger Sub.

  

  

(b) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has not engaged in any

are beneficially owned (as defined by Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) by
Parent or Merger Sub, or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent or Merger Sub. Merger Sub has no Subsidiaries.

  

  

(c) None of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates owns (directly
or indirectly, beneficially or of record) any shares of Common Stock, and none
of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates holds any rights to
acquire or vote any shares of Common Stock except pursuant to this Agreement.
Before the action of the Company Board taken on December 30, 2010, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub, alone or together with any other Person, was at any
time, or became, an "interested shareholder" of the Company as defined in
Section 912 of the NYBCL, or has taken any action that would cause the
restrictions on business combinations with interested shareholders set forth
in Section 912 of the NYBCL to be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or
any transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) None of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates has any

and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and Merger
Sub will have as of the Effective Time and the Closing sufficient cash
available to pay all amounts to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including Parent's and Merger Sub's costs and expenses, the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration, and the payments contemplated by Section 2.3 on
the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, and as of the Effective
Time and the Closing there will not be any restriction on the use of such cash
or cash equivalents for such purpose.

  

  

Section 4.7 Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, (a) there is no
Legal Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries before any Governmental Authority that would
or seeks to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is subject to any Order of, or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority, in each case that
would or seeks to materially delay or prevent the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 4.8 Absence of Arrangements with Management. Other than this Agreement
and the Voting Agreements and the Split-Off Agreements, there are no
contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or obligations or
understandings between Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Company's management or the
Company Board, on the other hand, relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the operations of the Company after the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 4.9 Brokers. The Company, Newco and the Part D Entities will not be
responsible for any brokerage, finder's, success or other fee or commission to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

technology, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition,
prospects, projections, budgets, estimates or operational metrics, or as to
the accuracy or completeness of any of the information (including any
financial statements and any projections, estimates or other forward-looking
information) provided (including in any management presentations, information
or descriptive memorandum, certain "data rooms" maintained by the Company,
supplemental information or other materials or information with respect to any
of the above) or otherwise made available to Parent and Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, shareholders or Representatives and (b) that, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the Company, the Part

state securities laws or otherwise) based upon any such information provided
or made available, or statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to Parent,
Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, stockholders or Representatives, except (x) as and only to the
extent expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the
Split-Off Agreements or (y) in the case of fraud.

Company, and (ii) furnish promptly such information concerning (A) the
Medicare Part D Business and the Part D Entities and (B) as reasonably
necessary, Newco and the other Subsidiaries of the Company, as Parent or its
Representatives may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be required to provide such access if it determines that it
would (i) cause a violation of any Material Contract, (ii) constitute a
violation of any applicable Law or (iii) cause a material risk of disclosure
of any information that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result
in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties. Nothing herein shall
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose information to the
extent such information would result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or similar privilege or violate any confidentiality
obligation of such party existing as of the date of this Agreement or entered
into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice after
the date of this Agreement (provided that such party shall use reasonable best
efforts to permit such disclosure to be made in a manner consistent with the
protection of such privilege or to obtain any consent required to permit such
disclosure to be made without violation of such confidentiality obligations,
as applicable).

  

  

(b) Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 9, 2010 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), between Parent and the Company with respect to the information
disclosed under this Section 5.3(b).

  

  

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, rights to conduct or cause to be conducted any intrusive
environmental investigation of the current or former operations or facilities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the written consent of the
Company in its reasonable discretion.

  

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including the Medicare Part D Business) before the Effective
Time. Before the Effective Time, the Company shall, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, exercise complete control and supervision
over the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the
Medicare Part D Business).

  

  

Section 5.4 Solicitation.

  

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the date on which the Requisite
Company Vote has been obtained, except as expressly permitted by Section
5.4(b), the Company shall not, nor shall the Company permit any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information or providing access to
its properties, books, records or personnel) any inquiries regarding, or the
making of any proposal or offer with respect to a Takeover Proposal, or (ii)
have any discussions (other than to state that the Company is not permitted to
have discussions) or participate in any negotiations regarding a Takeover
Proposal, or execute or enter into any Contract with respect to a Takeover
Proposal, or approve or recommend a Takeover Proposal or any agreement,
understanding or arrangement relating to a Takeover Proposal. Immediately
following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall cease and cause
to be terminated all discussions or negotiations conducted heretofore with any
Person other than Parent with respect to any Takeover Proposal.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), if, before obtaining the Requisite Company
Vote and following the receipt by the Company of a Takeover Proposal from any
Person, which Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and
did not result from a breach of this Section 5.4, the Company Board
determines, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that such
Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal,
subject to compliance with this Section 5.4, (x) furnish access and
information with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the
Person who has made such Takeover Proposal pursuant to one or more
confidentiality agreements on terms no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement ("Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreements") (provided that all such access and information has previously
been provided to Parent or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

is provided to Parent substantially concurrently with the time it is provided
to such Person except to the extent the provision of such information would
constitute a violation of applicable Law) and (y) participate in discussions
and negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal (in each case within 24 hours of receipt thereof) and
specify the terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the Person(s)
making such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent (within 24
hours) orally and in writing of any material modifications to the financial or
other material terms of such Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth in Sections 5.4(d) or (e), the Company Board shall
not, directly or indirectly, (i) withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent (or take any action or make any
statement that is inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation) (a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii) approve, endorse or recommend a
Takeover Proposal or (iii) approve, recommend or allow the Company to enter
into a Contract relating to a Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent permitted by Section 5.4(b)).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(c), the Company Board may, before obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote, in response to a Superior Proposal received by the
Company Board after the date of this Agreement, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, but only if:

  

  

(i) the Company Board has concluded in good faith, following consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, its
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

  

  

(ii) such Superior Proposal did not result, directly or indirectly, from a
breach by the Company of this Section 5.4;

  

  

(iii) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent of
its intention to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice
shall include the most recent version of the proposed agreement under which
the transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal is proposed to be
consummated and the identity of the Person(s) making such Superior Proposal;
and

  

  

(iv) Parent does not make, within five Business Days after the receipt of such
notice, a binding, written and complete (including any schedules or exhibits)
proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor, causes the Takeover Proposal that constituted a
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal (it being
understood that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notification pursuant to
the foregoing clause (iii) and a new five-Business Day period under this
clause (iv)).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, or making any
required disclosure to the Company's shareholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required under applicable
Law; provided, in each case, that (x) any such action taken or disclosure made
is consistent with this Section 5.4 and (y) unless the Company Board reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation in connection therewith within ten Business

Period"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, provide to each Part D
Employee (i) salary, hourly wage rate, short-term (annual or more frequent)
bonus or commission opportunity and other compensation (excluding equity and
equity-based awards which will remain discretionary) that are no less
favorable and (ii) benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than
those provided to such Part D Employee under the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' compensation and benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements
and arrangements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the
sake of clarity, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
shall provide each Part D Employee with the opportunity to enroll in the
compensation and benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates as of the Effective Time; provided that Parent
shall have received all information necessary to effectuate such enrollment.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) 2010 Bonus Plan. The Company may pay bonuses to Part D Employees and other
Company employees in respect of calendar year 2010 in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice.

  

  

(c) 2011 Bonus Plan. The target bonus opportunity for the year ended December
31, 2011 for each Part D Employee shall be not less than such Part D
Employee's target bonus opportunity for the year ended December 31, 2010.
Pursuant to the Company Severance Plan, each Part D Employee will be entitled
to receive a pro-rated bonus applicable to such Part D Employee in the event
such Part D Employee is terminated without Cause (as defined in Section 5.7(d)
of the Company Disclosure Letter) or resigns for Good Reason (as defined in
Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter) prior to the twelve (12)
month anniversary of the Closing Date (provided that (x) the provisions of
this sentence shall not result in the duplication of bonus payments to such
Part D Employee and (y) for the avoidance of doubt, the pro-rated portion of
any bonus payment for an Part D Employee shall assume a target bonus payout
for such pro-rated period).

  

  

(d) As to each Part D Employee, Parent shall honor the Company severance
program set forth on Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
"Company Severance Plan").

the Effective Time providing for the payment of retention bonuses to certain
Part D Employees in connection with the Merger for the purpose of retaining
the services of such Part D Employees, on the terms set forth on Section

Surviving Corporation and/or Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the
retention bonuses pursuant to the terms set forth on Section 5.7(f) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(g) For all purposes under all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving

benefits to any Part D Employee after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"),
each Part D Employee shall receive full credit for such Part D Employee's
years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective
Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for
which the Company and its Subsidiaries have given credit for prior service),
to the same extent as such Part D Employee was entitled, prior to the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar or comparable
Company Benefit Plan (except to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of accrual of benefits). In addition, where applicable, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject only to (i) Parent
receiving all information necessary with respect to Part D Employees and (ii)
any required approval of the applicable insurer, which Parent agrees to use or
cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries and Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, if any: (1) at the Effective Time,
each Part D Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in each New Plan to the extent such waiting time was satisfied
under a similar or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Part D Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old
Plans"); (2) Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions or
limitations and actively-at-work requirements of each New Plan to be waived or
satisfied for such Part D Employee and his or her covered dependents to the
extent waived or satisfied under the analogous Old Plan as of the Effective
Time; and (3) Parent shall cause all eligible expenses incurred by each Part D
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such Part D Employee's participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Part D Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

  

  

(h) With respect to any accrued but unused paid time off to which any Part D
Employee is entitled pursuant to the paid time off policy applicable to such
Part D Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates to, (i) allow such Part D Employee to use such accrued paid time
off and, (ii) if any Part D Employee's employment terminates during the
Continuation Period under circumstances entitling the Part D Employee to
severance pay under the Company Severance Plan, pay the Part D Employee, in
cash, an amount for a number of days of paid time off calculated as follows:
(A) the number of accrued days of paid time off to which the Part D Employee
is entitled as of the date of such termination, and (B) reducing this number
by the number of days of paid time off actually used by the Part D Employee
prior to the date of termination.

  

  

(i) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent
and its Representatives access at all reasonable times to the Part D Employees
and the employment and personnel records and data relating to the Part D
Employees to the maximum extent permitted under applicable Law.

  

  

(j) Nothing in this Section 5.7, whether express or implied, shall confer upon
any current or former employee of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any rights
or remedies including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this
Section 5.7.

conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Law
(but subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the limitations set forth in
Section 5.9) each of the parties to this Agreement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the
conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable. The
terms of this Section 5.8 shall not limit the rights of the Company set forth
in Section 5.4 or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

impose any obligations on Parent or Merger Sub that are not specifically
provided for in this Agreement.

Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings and notifications, including by
providing copies of all relevant documents to the non-filing party's outside
antitrust or applicable regulatory counsel (and to the non-filing party upon
consent of the filing party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) before filing. Neither Parent nor the Company shall consent to any
voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of
the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

receipt of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent or the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Company (or any of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for
additional information from any Governmental Authority that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, to the extent practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response to such request.
Prior to delivery of such response, to the extent practicable, such party
shall provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such response. No party shall participate in any meeting, or engage
in any material substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority
without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation
and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to
attend or participate. Parent shall advise the Company promptly of any
understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which Parent
proposes to make or enter into with any Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to Section 5.9(e), each of
Parent and the Company shall promptly take, in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, all actions necessary to (i) avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Order of or sought

required and the Company shall not be permitted by this Section 5.9 to take or
agree to undertake any action, including entering into any consent decree,
hold separate order or other arrangement, that would (i) require the
divestiture of any assets (of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates) collectively representing in excess of the amount of premium
revenues set forth on Section 5.9(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter
(measured on the basis of premium revenues attributable to such assets for the
2010 fiscal year) (the "Maximum Divestiture Amount"), (ii) limit in any
respect Parent's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
consolidate and control, the Medicare Part D Business following the Effective
Time or (iii) require taking any other action that would reasonably be
expected to diminish the benefits reasonably expected to be derived by Parent
on the date of this Agreement from the acquisition (whether by reason of
impact on Parent's existing businesses or assets or on the Medicare Part D
Business), in such a manner that Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement in the face of such diminished benefits unless in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii) such actions would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company

Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to make available and cause the
necessary personnel to work together in good faith to finalize the terms of

condition set forth in Article VI to be unsatisfied in any material respect at

this Agreement or any Split-Off Agreement or the ability of any party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; provided, however,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.19 shall not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice nor shall the party giving such notice be prejudiced with respect
to any such matters solely by virtue of having given such notice.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall provide to Parent copies of
(x) all material written notices received from any Governmental Authority by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such notice is primarily
related to the Medicare Part D Business and (y) all material written notices
received from CMS by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case from
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, provided that
the foregoing shall not apply to the Company's communications with CMS
concerning the resolution of matters set forth in the November 2010 CMS Letter
(as defined in Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter), except to the
extent related, directly or indirectly, to the Medicare Part D Business.

  

  

Section 5.20 Adjustment Certificates.

  

  

(a) No later than March 14, 2011, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
certificate executed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company (the
"Statutory Capital Adjustment Certificate") setting forth the amount of each
of (i) the Statutory Capital of Penn Life relating to the Medicare Part D
Business as of December 31, 2010 (as adjusted, if at all, pursuant to Section
5.20(e), the "Statutory Capital 12/31 Amount"), (ii) the 2010 Annual Statement
of Penn Life as filed with the Insurance Department of the State of
Pennsylvania and (iii) the Authorized Control Level of Penn Life relating to
the Medicare Part D Business as of December 31, 2010 (as adjusted, if at all,
pursuant to Section 5.20(e), the "Authorized Control Level Amount"), in each
case as calculated in accordance with the methodologies set forth in Section
5.20 of the Company Disclosure Letter. No later than three Business Days prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate
executed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company (the "Closing Date
Indebtedness Certificate") setting forth the amount of the Company
Indebtedness (the "Closing Date Indebtedness Amount").

  

  

(b) From and after the date of the delivery of the Closing Date Indebtedness
Certificate to the Effective Time, the Company shall not incur, assume or
guarantee any indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of the amount of
Company Indebtedness set forth in the Closing Date Indebtedness Certificate.

  

  

(c) Within fifteen (15) days after Parent's receipt of the Statutory Capital
Adjustment Certificate, Parent shall deliver to the Company a written
statement either accepting the Statutory Capital Adjustment Certificate or
specifying any objections thereto (including therein Parent's calculations of
such amounts and Parent's grounds for such disagreement in reasonable detail)
(a "Statutory Capital Objections Statement"). The Statutory Capital Objections
Statement shall specify those items or amounts as to which Parent disagrees,
and Parent shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the calculations delivered by the Company pursuant to Section
5.20(a).

  

  

(d) If Parent shall have delivered a Statutory Capital Objections Statement,
the Company and Parent shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such
delivery, negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on the disputed items

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amounts set forth in
the Statutory Capital Adjustment Certificate. If the Company and Parent are
unable to reach such agreement during such period, they shall promptly
thereafter appoint an independent accountant of nationally recognized standing
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent (the "Statutory Capital
Accounting Firm") to promptly review this Agreement and the disputed items or
amounts for the purpose of calculating the amounts set forth in the Statutory
Capital Adjustment Certificate. In making such calculations, the Statutory
Capital Accounting Firm shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Statutory Capital Objections Statement. The Statutory Capital Accounting Firm,
acting as experts and not as arbitrators, shall determine in accordance with
the methodologies set forth in Section 5.20 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the actual Statutory Capital 12/31 Amount and the Authorized Control Level
Amount and shall deliver to the Company and Newco a written report setting
forth such calculations. Such report shall be final and binding upon the
Company and Parent. The cost of such review and report shall be borne equally
by the Company and Parent.

  

  

(e) The parties agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective
independent accountants and Subsidiaries to, cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the calculations of the amounts set forth in the Statutory
Capital Adjustment Certificate and in the conduct of the reviews referred to
in this Section 5.20, including by making available to the extent necessary
their respective books, records, work papers and personnel.

  

  

(f) The Statutory Capital 12/31 Amount and the Authorized Control Level Amount
as of the Effective Time shall equal the amount determined under this Section
5.20 by agreement of the parties pursuant to Section 5.20(d) or by the
Statutory Capital Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 5.20(e).

  

  

Section 5.21 Termination of Medco Agreement. On the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall deliver to Medco Health Solutions, Inc. a notice of
termination of that certain Subcontract for Medicare Part D Prescription
Benefits Management Services, dated January 1, 2009, between Medco Health
Solutions, Inc. and MemberHealth, LLC, pursuant to Section 8.2.6 thereof and
otherwise in accordance with the terms thereof.

  

  

Section 5.22 2012 CMS Bid Process.

  

  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Part D Entities to, use
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with past practice to participate
in the Medicare Part D bid process for the 2012 plan year. If the Closing has
not occurred on or prior to May 1, 2011, the Company and Parent shall
immediately thereafter jointly appoint an actuarial firm from among those
firms set forth on Section 5.22 of the Company Disclosure Letter, which firm
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent (the "Actuarial
Firm"), to review the bid submission(s) of the Company and/or the Part D
Entities for the 2012 plan year (the "Bid Submission") solely for the purpose
of determining whether the Bid Submission constitutes a good faith bid
consistent with the Company's past practice in all material respects (a "Good
Faith Bid"). The Actuarial

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Firm shall not be permitted to disclose to Parent or any of its Affiliates any
information relating to the Bid Submission other than to state whether or not
the Bid Submission constitutes a Good Faith Bid.

  

  

(b) Within five Business Days from the date of appointment, the Company shall
deliver the Bid Submission to the Actuarial Firm and the Actuarial Firm shall
as soon as practicable, but in any event within seven days after receipt
thereof, notify the Company of its determination as to whether the Bid
Submission constitutes a Good Faith Bid. To the extent that the Actuarial Firm
determines that the Bid Submission is not a Good Faith Bid, the Company shall
work together with the Actuarial Firm in good faith to resolve any material
issues identified by the Actuarial Firm in respect of the Bid Submission.

  

  

(c) Nothing in this Section 5.22 shall be deemed to give Parent or any of its
Affiliates any direct or indirect control of any bid submission of the Company
or the Part D Entities prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 5.23 Relationships with Certain Parties. From the date hereof until
the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, consult and cooperate with each other
concerning the communications of the Company and Parent with the Persons set
forth on Section 5.23 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Section 5.23
Persons") relating (a) to the Contracts between the Company and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Section 5.23 Persons, on the other hand,
and (b) in any material respect to this Agreement, the Split-Off Agreements or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby ((a) and (b) collectively, the
"Section 5.23 Matters"). In furtherance of the foregoing, neither the Company
nor Parent shall participate in any meeting, or engage in any material
substantive conversation, in each case relating to the Section 5.23 Matters,
with any Section 5.23 Person without giving the other party prior notice of
the meeting or conversation and the opportunity to attend or participate. Each
of Parent and the Company shall promptly inform the other party upon receipt
of any communication from any Section 5.23 Person relating to the Section 5.23
Matters, and neither party shall enter into any understandings, undertakings
or agreements (oral or written) with any Section 5.23 Person without the prior
consent of the other party, in each case relating to the Section 5.23 Matters.
Prior to any written communication with a Section 5.23 Person relating to the
Section 5.23 Matters, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall provide
the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
communication and shall include in such communication all comments reasonably
proposed by such other party. Neither the Company nor Parent shall take any
actions with respect to the Section 5.23 Matters that, to the Knowledge of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, would reasonably be expected to prevent or
to materially impede, delay or interfere with the Merger, the Split-Off or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Split-Off Agreements.
Promptly following the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall
meet jointly with the Section 5.23 Persons and Parent shall communicate the
matters set forth on Section 5.23 of the Company Disclosure Letter to the
Section 5.23 Persons. For the avoidance of doubt, each of the Company and
Parent acknowledges that the other

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

party maintains an ongoing business relationship with Section 5.23 Persons,
and this Section 5.23 shall not prohibit the Company or Parent from engaging
in communications or meetings with Section 5.23 Persons in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice that are unrelated to the Section
5.23 Matters. Neither Parent nor the Company shall be entitled to participate
in, or receive notice of, any such excluded communications.

  

  

Section 5.24 Certain Litigation.

  

  

(a) Parent shall assume the control and defense at its own expense of all
shareholder litigation against (i) the Parent, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any directors or officers of Parent or its Subsidiaries or
(ii) the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of directors or officers of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (such Persons set forth in this clause (ii),
the "Covered Persons"), in each case, arising out of or in connection with the
Separation, the Split-Off or the Merger (collectively, the "Shareholder
Litigation"); provided that the Covered Persons shall have the right to
participate in (but not control) such proceedings and to be represented by one
counsel for all Covered Persons of their choosing. The reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall constitute Transaction Litigation
Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, Parent shall reimburse,
indemnify and hold harmless each Covered Person for all costs and expenses
incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Covered Persons in
connection with the Shareholder Litigation (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, all Transaction Litigation Expenses, which may include only the
reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel for all Covered Persons). Each
Covered Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.24.

  

  

(b) Parent shall obtain the prior written consent of the Company and the
Covered Persons (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before
entering into any settlement, understanding or other agreement relating to
such Shareholder Litigation.

  

  

(c) Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense of any Shareholder Litigation and shall furnish or cause to be
furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend, at Parent's
expense, such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  

  

Section 5.25 Designated Bonds.

  

  

(a) From time to time following the date of this Agreement (but no more than
two (2) times prior to the Designation Date (as defined below)), the Company
shall deliver to Parent at Parent's request a schedule setting forth all bonds
held by the Company and its Subsidiaries. Such schedule shall set forth the
material terms of each bond held by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
such date, including such bond's outstanding principal amount, maturity date,
original purchase price, investment credit rating and whether such bonds
relate to the Medicare Part D Business or the Non-Medicare Part D Business.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions in this Section 5.25, Parent shall be
entitled to designate one or more bonds held by the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Newco Bonds (as defined in the Separation
Agreement)) with an investment credit rating of A2/A or lower to be sold by
the Company prior to the Effective Time (such bond(s), the "Designated Part D
Bonds"). No less than 30 Business Days and no more than 60 Business Days prior
to the Effective Time (the "Designation Date"), Parent shall identify by
irrevocable written notice to the Company all Part D Designated Bonds.
Following receipt of such notice, the Company shall, prior the Effective Time,
(i) sell (at the Company's option) such Part D Designated Bonds to (A) a third
party or (B) a member of the Newco Group (in the case of this clause (B) for a
price equal to the fair market value of such Part D Designated Bond (valued as
if such Part D Designated Bond were sold in an arm's length transaction) and
(ii) thereafter acquire, with the proceeds of such sale, bonds with an
individual investment credit rating of A1/A+ or above (the "Designated Bond
Exchange"). Any gain or loss arising out of the Designated Bond Exchange
(calculated by applying the value of the Part D Designated Bonds on a basis
consistent with the Company's historical valuation methods) shall be taken
into account for purposes of determining Newco Cash in accordance with the
terms of the Separation Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.26 Parent Standstill. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any person acting on behalf of
Parent to, directly or indirectly, acquire (i) any Securities of the Company
or (ii) any derivative contracts or derivative securities that give Parent or
any Person acting on behalf of Parent the economic or voting equivalent of
ownership of Securities of the Company.

Section 8.8 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this
Agreement at any time before the Effective Time, whether before or after
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, so long as (a) no amendment that
requires further shareholder approval under applicable Law after shareholder
approval hereof shall be made without such required further approval and (b)
such amendment has been duly approved by the board of directors of each of

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 8.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (and the exhibits hereto), the
Split-Off Agreements, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure
Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement contain all of the terms, conditions
and representations and warranties agreed to by the parties relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement and the Split-Off Agreements and supersede
all prior or contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, correspondence,
undertakings, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and
oral, among the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of Section 4.12, no
representation, warranty, inducement, promise, understanding or condition not
set forth in this Agreement has been made or relied upon by any of the parties
to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.11 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except for (a) the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration (which, from and after the Effective Time,
shall be for the benefit of holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock as of
the Effective Time), (b) for the provisions of Section 5.18 (which, from and
after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of Newco) and (c) the
rights of Covered Persons under Section 5.24, Parent and the Company hereby
agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set
forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely
upon the representations and warranties set forth herein.

  

  

Section 8.12 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that provision in
order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and
purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of
this Agreement and the application of that provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of that provision, or the application of that provision, in any
other jurisdiction. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

  

Section 8.13 Rules of Construction. The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. Subject to and without limiting the introductory
language to Articles III and IV, each party to this Agreement has or may have
set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a section of

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

such disclosure letter that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to
which it relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a
disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not constitute an admission by such
party that such item is material, that such item has had or would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case
may be, or that the disclosure of such be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.14 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and
assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of
law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights or liabilities under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its absolute discretion,
except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part to one
or more Subsidiaries of Parent and, after the Effective Time, to any Person;
provided that no such transfer or assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger
Sub of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment in violation of the
foregoing shall be void.

  

  

Section 8.15 Remedies. Any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party
to this Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other
remedy contained in this Agreement, at law or in equity. The exercise by a
party to this Agreement of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by
it of any other remedy.

  

  

Section 8.16 Specific Performance. The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties to this Agreement shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York or any New York State Court sitting in New York
City, this being in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, and the
parties to this Agreement hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any
bond or similar collateral in connection therewith. The parties agree that
they shall not object to the granting of injunctive or other equitable relief
on the basis that there exists adequate remedy at Law.

  

  

Section 8.17 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, as if the signatures to each counterpart were upon
a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed an
original of this Agreement. Facsimile signatures or signatures received as a
pdf attachment to electronic mail shall be treated as original signatures for
all purposes of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when,
and only when, each party hereto shall have received a counterpart signed by
all of the other parties hereto.

  

  

Section 8.18 Merger Sub.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(a) At the Company's request no later than five (5) Business Days before the
Closing Date, Parent shall file (or cause Merger Sub to file) an election with
the U.S. Internal Revenue Services ("IRS") on Form 8832 (or successor form)
electing to treat Merger Sub as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, which election shall be effective at least one Business Day before
the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date,
Company and its Subsidiaries shall (x) prepare, in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with Current Practices (as defined in the Tax Matters
Agreement), and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by it (or
them) on or before the Closing Date ("Post-Signing Returns") and (y) consult
with Parent with respect to all material Post-Signing Returns and deliver
drafts of such Post-Signing Returns to Parent no later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the date (including extensions) on which such Post-Signing
Returns are required to be filed; provided that the financial information used
by Newco in the preparation of each such Post-Signing Return shall be based on
information prepared in accordance with either (A) GAAP applied on a
consistent basis or (B) statutory principles, as applicable; provided,
further, that the filing of such Post-Signing Return shall not result in the
Company being required to establish or increase a FASB Interpretation No. 48
("FIN 48") reserve that would, taken together with all other FIN 48 reserves
established or increased pursuant to this section and Sections 2.1(a)(i),
2.3(e) and 2.4(a) of the Tax Matters Agreement, be in excess of seven million
five hundred thousand dollars ($7,500,000).

  

  

(c) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall determine
that Merger Sub being a limited liability company instead of a corporation
adversely affects in any material respect or materially delays the parties'
ability to effect the Merger then, at the Company's request, upon no fewer
than five (5) Business Days notice (which notice shall be given no later than
five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date), Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to convert to a corporation as promptly as practicable and the parties shall
amend this Agreement to reflect such conversion.
