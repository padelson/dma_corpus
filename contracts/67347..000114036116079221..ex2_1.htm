Antitrust Conditions by the end of the Regulatory Authority's initial period
of review without the need for a second phase of investigation (including
agreeing to any conditions, undertakings or divestments to obtain clearance in
accordance with any applicable merger control law, statute or regulation of
any applicable jurisdiction); provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not,
and no member of the Purchaser\'s Group shall, be required to perform any
steps pursuant to this Clause 3.5(c) that would, in the opinion of the
Purchaser acting in good faith, have a material effect on the businesses of
either the Purchaser\'s Group or the Target Companies; and  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (d) | use its best endeavours to avoid any declaration of
incompleteness by the Regulatory Authority or any other suspension of the
periods for clearance.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

   3.6 | The Purchaser undertakes to the Seller to procure that neither it
nor any member of the Purchaser\'s Group shall (either alone or acting in
concert with any other person):

acquire); or  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (b) | execute definitive transaction documentation (or cause
another person to execute definitive transaction documentation) arrangements
that, if carried into effect, would result in the acquisition of,  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

a competing business to the business of any of the Target Companies, the
acquisition of which might reasonably be expected to prejudice or delay the
outcome of any filings with, or applications to, any Regulatory Authority. For
the avoidance of doubt, this Clause 3.6 shall not survive Completion.

  

  

   3.7 | Neither Party shall, without the prior written consent of the
other Party, withdraw any notification, filing or submission made to the
Regulatory Authority.  
---|---

(Termination).  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   4. | Closing Settlement Schedule  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   4.1 | Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Completion
Date, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser with a schedule (the "Closing
Settlement Schedule") setting out:  
---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (a) | the amount payable under the Intercompany Financing
Arrangement Payables, as calculated pursuant to Clause 16 (Cash Pool, Finance
and Hedging) (including all appropriate details including currency, identity
of payee and payee account details);  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (b) | the Daily Payment Amount;  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (c) | the Equity Contribution Amount (if any); and  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (d) | the amount of any known Leakage (if any).  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

   4.2 | In the event that Completion is deferred beyond the intended
Completion Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and a Closing
Settlement Schedule has been delivered to the Purchaser prior to such deferral
occurring, the Seller shall be entitled to deliver a revised Closing
Settlement Schedule to the Purchaser in accordance with Clause 4.1 and the
Closing Settlement Schedule previously submitted shall cease to apply or be
relevant for all purposes.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

 

17  

  

   5. | Consideration  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   5.1 | Consideration Amount  
---|--- 
  

  

  

The aggregate consideration for the sale and purchase of the Shares shall be:
(i) the payment by the Purchaser of an amount equal to the Cash Consideration;
and (ii) the issuance of the Stock Consideration, all of which shall be
allocated and paid, issued or discharged (as appropriate) on Completion in
accordance with this Clause 5 and Clause 7.3 (Completion) and the Seller
agrees that such payments shall constitute good and valid discharge of the
Purchaser\'s obligations with respect to payment of the Consideration under
this Agreement.

  

  

   5.2 | Consideration Allocation  
---|--- 
  

  

  

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Seller and the Purchaser agree that
the Consideration shall be allocated among the Shares in accordance with
Schedule 4 (Shares to be Transferred).

  

  

   5.3 | Consideration Adjustment  
---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (a) | If any Leakage is notified under Clause 11.2 (Notification of
Leakage) or otherwise comes to the attention of the Purchaser at or prior to
Completion and the Seller agrees that such Leakage has occurred and the amount
of such Leakage (a "Leakage Amount"), the Consideration shall be reduced by an
amount equal to such agreed aggregate Leakage Amounts, which shall discharge
the Seller\'s obligation to make payment of such Leakage Amount under Clause
11 (Leakage). The Seller agrees that any such Leakage Amount shall be deducted
from the Consideration that would otherwise be paid to the Seller in
accordance with this Clause 5 and Clause 7.3 (Completion).  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (b) | If any payment is made by the Seller to the Purchaser in
respect of any Leakage Claim or any breach of this Agreement (including any
breach of a Warranty), the payment shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Consideration paid by the Purchaser under this Agreement to the Seller and, in
such circumstances, the Consideration shall be deemed to have been reduced by
the amount of such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, this Clause 5.3 does
not operate to reduce the ability of the Purchaser to make a Claim or any
Leakage Claim or the amount of the Claim or any Leakage Claim.

the release of all relevant security under the Intercompany Financing
Arrangement Payables and any associated hedging arrangements upon such

18  

  

    | (b) | the senior management of the Seller\'s Group provides the

the Transaction, the "Financing Sources") or as may be reasonably requested by
a Financing Source, the entering into of a financing in connection with the
Transaction, provided always that no Target Company shall be required to enter
into any agreement or arrangement which, prior to Completion, results in an
obligation for borrowed amounts or any other liability or contingent
obligation or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or to incur any other
out of pocket cost or expense to a third party (except such fees, costs and
expenses as the Purchaser agrees in writing to promptly reimburse) in
connection with any such financing, amendment, waiver or consent; and  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (c) | the Target Companies and the senior management of the
Seller\'s Group shall provide, as soon as reasonably practicable at the
Purchaser\'s cost, such information and assistance as the Purchaser may
reasonably request as is required by the Purchaser in order to begin
preparatory work to prepare audited financial information in respect of the
Target Companies to the extent required by law and to satisfy the Purchaser\'s
regulatory obligations (including those of the New York Stock Exchange). Any
auditing fees and expenses will be borne by the Purchaser; provided, that such
fees are reasonable and reflect customary market rates for equivalent work of
this nature.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

   6.3 | The Purchaser shall promptly, upon request from the Seller,
reimburse the Seller for all reasonable out of pocket expenses (including
legal fees) incurred by the Seller in connection with the cooperation
contemplated by Clauses 6.2(b) and 6.2(c)

the extent reasonably practicable, consulted on), but only for so long as such
emergency or disaster situation continues and solely to the extent necessary
or prudent to mitigate the effects of such emergency or disaster situation and
provided further that nothing in this paragraph shall exonerate the Seller for
any liability that it may have for any breach of Clause 6.2 which may have led
to such emergency or disaster situation;  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (d) | any matter expressly permitted by, or necessary for
performance of, this Agreement (including for the avoidance of doubt any
matters set out in the definition of Permitted Leakage) or the Transaction
Documents or necessary for Completion; or  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (e) | any matter undertaken at the written request or with the

    | (i) | if an Underinsured Incident occurs; and

    | (ii) | such Underinsured Incident has a material adverse effect on
the Target Companies,  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

the Purchaser shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement without any

(Termination), unless the Seller agrees to pay, or cause another Seller's
Group entity to pay, to the Purchaser the amount calculated as the difference

Underinsured Property after the date of this Agreement such that the relevant
Underinsured Property is covered for property damage and business interruption
insurance in an amount not less than the amount set out beside such
Underinsured Property's description in the definition of "Underinsured
Properties," and provides the Purchaser with written confirmation of such
increased coverage, such Underinsured Property shall be excluded from the
definition of "Underinsured Properties" with effect from the time such
increased coverage takes effect. The Seller (and for the avoidance of doubt no
Target Company) shall be responsible for the costs and expenses of arranging
such increased insurance coverage.

Agreement the Purchaser may notify the Seller that it requires the Seller to,
prior to Completion, convert to equity any amount of any intra-group loan owed
by Luvata Italy S.r.l. to the Seller's Group. The Parties agree and
acknowledge that, in determining the relevant amount, the settlement of the
aggregate amount of any cash deposits made by Luvata Italy S.r.l. shall be
taken into account first in repaying such intra-group loan and only the
remaining balance of such intra-group loan may be required to be converted.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (b) | In the event either of the Parties determines that it would
be advisable to convert, prior to Completion, any intra-group loans to equity
in respect of any other Target Company than Luvata Italy S.r.l., the Parties
shall discuss in good faith to agree the amount, if any, and time of such
proposed conversion.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

   7. | Completion  
---|---

    | (m) | since January 1, 2014, the Purchaser has filed all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed with the
SEC by the Purchaser under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including
pursuant to Section 13(a) thereof (the foregoing materials, including the
exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein, being collectively referred to herein as the "SEC Reports") on a
timely basis. As of their respective dates, the SEC Reports complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act, as applicable, and none of the SEC Reports, when filed, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The financial statements of the Purchaser included in the SEC
Reports comply in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as
in effect at the time of filing. Such financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved ("GAAP"), except as
may be otherwise specified in such financial statements or the notes thereto
and except that unaudited financial statements may not contain all footnotes
required by GAAP, and fairly present in all material respects the financial
position of the Purchaser and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the
dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods
then ended, subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, year-end
audit adjustments. Purchaser maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Purchaser has (A) reasonably
designed disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of Rules 13a-
15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
of Purchaser and (B) disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date of this Agreement, to its auditors and the audit committee of its
board of directors (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect its ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in its internal controls. There are no unresolved comments in comment
letters received from the SEC staff with respect to the SEC Reports filed or
furnished on or prior to the date hereof.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

   10.2 | Notification Obligation

other documentation for the specific benefit of the Purchaser in connection
with the Transaction (subject always to the terms of any reliance letter
entered into between the Purchaser and the relevant adviser and/or the terms
of engagement of such adviser); and (ii) the Seller to the extent permitted by
any contractual arrangements between the Seller and the Purchaser.

Not less than three (3) weeks prior to the Completion Date, the Seller shall
provide such access as is reasonably requested, upon reasonable notice and
during reasonable times, by the Purchaser and an auditor engaged solely by and
at the expense of the Purchaser (the "Auditor") to the management, books and
records of the Target Companies (the "Requested Information") so as to enable
the Purchaser and the Auditor to undertake a reasonable review identifying any
Leakage during the period from (but excluding) the Locked Box Date to (and
including) the date(s) to which such Requested Information relates, the
results of which will be made available to the Target Companies (subject to

25  

  

   11.5 | Limitations  
---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (a) | The liability of the Seller under this Clause 11 shall
terminate on the expiry of the period of three (3) months following the
Completion Date, save in respect of any claim for breach of Clause 11 of which
the Purchaser has given notice in writing to the Seller before the expiry of
that period containing reasonable details of the relevant breach and of the
calculation of the amounts claimed, in which case, in relation to any relevant
breaches so notified, the Seller shall remain liable until any relevant claims
have been satisfied, settled or withdrawn and any payment in respect of such
satisfaction or settlement has been made to the Purchaser.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (b) | The aggregate liability of the Seller in respect of all
claims under Clause 11 shall not exceed the amount of Leakage received by or
benefitted the Seller or its Related Persons.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (c) | The Parties agree that the Permitted Leakage do not
constitute Leakage.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

   11.6 | Expert Determination  
---|--- 
  

  

  

If the liability for or quantum of a Leakage Claim notified pursuant to Clause
11.5(a) above is not agreed in writing between the Purchaser and the Seller
within 10 Business Days of the Leakage Claim being notified to the Seller (the
"Leakage Dispute"):

  

  

    | (a) | the Leakage Dispute shall be referred to an independent
expert appointed by agreement between the Purchaser and the Seller (and, in
the absence of such agreement as to the independent expert within five
Business Days, the independent expert shall be chosen by the President for the
time being of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales on
the written application by the Purchaser) (the "Leakage Expert") who shall
determine the amount of Leakage (if any) received by the Seller, such
determination to be made by the Leakage Expert acting on the following
basis:  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (i) | the Leakage Expert shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator;  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (ii) | the Leakage Expert's terms of reference shall be limited to
determining the liability for and/or the quantum of Leakage as set out in the
notice of the relevant Leakage Claim;  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (iii) | the Leakage Expert's determination with respect to any
Leakage Dispute shall be within the range of values assigned by the Purchaser
to such item in the notice of the relevant Leakage Claim and the liability for
or quantum of Leakage in respect of such Leakage Claim asserted by the Seller,
and shall be final and binding on the Purchaser and the Seller;  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (iv) | except to the extent that the Purchaser and the Seller agree
otherwise in writing, the Leakage Expert shall determine his own procedure,
but the procedure of the Leakage Expert shall give the Purchaser and the
Seller a reasonable opportunity to make written and oral representations,
allow a party to the Leakage Dispute to be present while any oral
representations are being made to the Leakage Expert by the other party, and
require a party to the Leakage Dispute to supply to the other party a copy of
any written representations at the same time as they are supplied to the
Leakage Expert;  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

 

26  

  

    | (v) | if, notwithstanding paragraph (iv) above, the Leakage Expert
determines that he lacks sufficient evidence or information to determine the
liability for and/or the quantum of Leakage as set out in the notice of the
relevant Leakage Claim, he may decline to provide a determination and Clause
35 shall apply;  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (vi) | the Leakage Expert's costs (including any fees and costs of
any advisers appointed by the Leakage Expert) shall be based upon the
percentage that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party
bears to the amount actually contested between the Parties, as determined by
the Leakage Expert. For example, if EUR 100 is contested by the relevant
Parties and EUR 75 is awarded to the Purchaser, then the Purchaser shall pay
25% of the costs of the Leakage Expert and the Seller shall pay 75% of the
costs of the Leakage Expert; and  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (vii) | the Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate with the
Leakage Expert, and shall comply with all reasonable requests (including
requests for information relating to a Target Company) made by the Leakage
Expert in connection with the carrying out of his duties.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (b) | Following the Leakage Expert determining the amount of
Leakage received by, or for the benefit of, the Seller, if any, the Seller
shall pay to the Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the amount of any
Leakage so determined.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (c) | For the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a Leakage
Expert prior to Completion shall not give rise to a right of any Party to
defer, or otherwise delay, Completion.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

   12. | Restrictive covenants  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   12.1 | The Seller shall not, and shall procure that none of its Related
Persons shall, at any time during the Restricted Period solicit, or attempt to
entice away, or hire any Senior Employee who at the relevant time is employed
by any Target Company.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   12.2 | Whilst the undertaking in Clause 12.1 is considered by the
Purchaser and the Seller to be reasonable in all the circumstances, if it
should for any reason be held to be invalid, but would have been held to be
valid if part of the wording were deleted or modified, the undertaking shall
apply with the minimum modifications necessary to make it valid and
effective.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   13. | Termination  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   13.1 | Save for the Parties' express right to terminate in Clause 3.10

rights of rescission which it may have in respect of any matter to the full
extent permitted by law, other than such rights in respect of fraud,
fraudulent misrepresentation or wilful concealment. Without prejudice to the

rescission is excluded in relation to all matters and shall not be available,
save in respect of fraud or wilful concealment.

    | (c) | Clause 7.4 (Completion),  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

 

27  

  

the rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall cease
immediately, save in respect of antecedent breaches (but excluding any right
of the Purchaser to claim damages for breach of Warranty or of the Seller's
obligations under Clause 6 (Preâ€‘Completion Obligations)) and under the
Continuing Provisions.

  

  

   14. | Resigning Directors  
---|---

   15.2 | With effect from Completion all insurance cover previously
maintained by the Seller's Group in respect of the Target Companies or their
businesses or assets shall cease; provided, however, that any insurance
policies which are, prior to Completion, held directly by a Target Company
independently from any group-level insurance policies shall not be terminated
by the Seller (or relevant Target Company) and the Seller shall use reasonable
efforts to assist the Purchaser to ensure that such insurance policy remains
in place following the Completion Date.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   16. | Cash Pool, Finance and Hedging  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   16.1 | The Parties agree that all Intercompany Cash Pooling

    | (b) | On the day which is eight (8) Business Days prior to the
Completion Date, all Intercompany Hedging Arrangements in place between any

relevant Intercompany Hedging Arrangement;  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (c) | On the day which is eight (8) Business Days prior to the
Completion Date, all Intercompany Cash Pooling Arrangements in place between

    | (d) | On the day which is eight (8) Business Days prior to the

Company from the Seller's cash pool into stand-alone accounts for each Target
Company;  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

 

28  

  

    | (e) | Immediately after the Seller completes the actions set out in
Clauses 16.1(b), 16.1(c) and 16.1(d), in the event a Target Company has a
positive balance in the cash pool, the Seller will on behalf of the Target
Company deposit an amount equal to the funding required by the relevant Target
Company until Completion in the stand-alone account of the relevant entity,
and the remaining positive balance will be booked as an intra-group receivable
of the relevant Target Company; in the event a Target Company has a negative
balance in the cash pool, the negative balance will be booked as an intra-
group loan (and such intra-group loan shall accrue interest in accordance with
Schedule 13 (Interest rates to be applied to Intercompany Financing Agreements
and internal deposits)) of the relevant Target Company;  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (f) | In the event any Target Company, in the Seller's reasonable
opinion and subject to consultation with the Purchaser, requires additional
funding on its stand-alone bank account until Completion the Seller will
transfer the required amount to the stand-alone bank account of the Target
Company, and this amount will be booked as an intra-group loan (and such
intra-group loan shall accrue interest in accordance with Schedule 13
(Interest rates to be applied to Intercompany Financing Agreements and

---|--- 
  

  

  

   17.1 | Prior to Completion, the Seller or any member of the Seller's
Group may transfer the Transferring Employee to any of the Target Companies,
whether the transfer is implemented through the operation of applicable laws,
or through the relevant Target Company making an offer of employment, or
otherwise. Where any such Transferring Employee is transferred to such Target
Company, the Transferring Employee shall be employed by such Target Company
upon terms no less favourable to the Transferring Employee than the employment
contract of such Transferring Employee with the Seller's Group immediately
prior to the transfer; provided, however, that from the date of this Agreement
the Seller shall not amend or alter the terms of the employment contract of
such Transferring Employee without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser.

   17.2 | If any Transferring Employee is not employed by the Target
Companies on Completion and does not transfer automatically by operation of
applicable laws to a Target Company, the Purchaser or any member of the
Purchaser's Group as a result of the Transaction, the Seller shall, or shall

employment of such Transferring Employee with effect from Completion and the
Purchaser shall, in consultation with the Seller, procure that an offer of
employment is made in writing to that Transferring Employee by the Target
Companies or a member of the Purchaser's Group on terms no less favourable

being made.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   17.3 | With effect from Completion, each Transferring Employee shall
cease to be an active member of an employee benefit plan of the Seller's Group
and the Purchaser shall, or procure that a member of the Purchaser's Group
shall, establish new employee benefit plans for each Transferring Employee on
terms no less favourable than the employee benefit plans in existence prior to
an offer being made. The Purchaser shall be responsible for the costs and
expenses of establishing such new employee benefit plans.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   17.4 | The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of

a result of, arising out of, or in connection with the termination of
employment of any Transferring Employee who does not transfer to the Target
Companies, the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser's Group or does not
accept an offer of employment made by a member of the Purchaser's Group, and
any claim brought by such Transferring Employee in respect of any actual or
anticipatory breach of contract and/or actual or anticipatory breach of
statutory employment rights because of any change to any terms and conditions
of employment or the termination of his or her employment on or after
Completion.

   18.1 | For a period of seven (7) years following Completion, the
Purchaser shall, and procure that the Target Companies shall, if reasonably
requested by the Seller (at the expense of the Seller) and subject to the
Seller giving such undertakings as to confidentiality as the Purchaser may
reasonably require, allow the Seller, access (including the right to take
copies) to the books and records of the Target Companies which:  
---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (a) | is reasonably required by the Seller:  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (i) | for the purpose of dealing with its Tax and accounting
affairs; or  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (ii) | in order to negotiate, refute, settle, compromise or
otherwise deal with any claim, investigation or enquiry by a Taxation
Authority regarding the Seller; and  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

 

30  

  

    | (b) | relates to income, profits or gains earned, accrued or
received (or treated for Tax purposes as earned, accrued or received) or any
event occurring (or treated for Tax purposes as occurring) on or before
Completion.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, this Clause 18.1 relates to the provision of Tax
and accounting information and does not require the Purchaser or any Target
Company to do anything other than to provide such information and give such
assistance as is reasonably necessary for the provision of such information.

  

  

   18.2 | To the extent that any information reasonably required for the
Business is not in the possession of the Purchaser but remains held by the
Seller or the Seller's Group, then for a period of seven (7) years following
Completion the Seller shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure that,
subject to the Purchaser giving such undertakings as to confidentiality as the
Seller may reasonably require, copies of such information are provided to the
Purchaser as soon as reasonably practicable following a written request for
such information by the Purchaser, provided that this requirement shall not
apply to any information which if provided would or, in the opinion of the
Seller acting in good faith, may:  
---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (a) | result in a breach of contract or breach of confidence owed
to a third party; or  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (b) | be detrimental to the business of the Seller or the Seller's
Group.  
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

   19. | Tax  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   19.1 | In respect of any accounting period (or portion thereof) for
income Tax purposes commencing before the Completion Date and ending on the
Completion Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period"), the Purchaser shall procure
that the Tax Returns of the Target Companies shall be prepared on a basis
which is consistent with the manner in which those Tax Returns were prepared
for all accounting periods ending before the Completion Date, unless otherwise
required by law. The Purchaser shall procure that the Target Companies provide
to the Seller all Tax Returns for income Tax purposes relating to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period no later than ten (10) Business Days before the date on
which such Tax Returns are required to be filed with the appropriate Tax
Authority without incurring interest or penalties. The Purchaser shall further
procure that the Target Companies shall take the Seller's reasonable comments
into account before the Tax Returns are submitted to the appropriate Tax
Authority.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   19.2 | The Seller covenants to pay the Purchaser an amount equal to any
liability to Taxation which is the liability of a member of the Seller\'s
Group (or any entity which at any time prior to Completion was a member of the
Seller\'s Group) (the "Primary Person") and which arises on or before the date
which falls two (2) years after the Completion Date, for which a Target
Company, the Purchaser or any other member of the Purchaser\'s Group is liable
in consequence of (i) the Primary Person failing to discharge such liability
to Taxation, and (ii) a Target Company at any time before the Completion Date
being or having been treated as connected or associated with the Primary
Person or being or having been treated as connected or associated with the
same person as the Primary Person for any Tax purpose (including as a result
as being part of the same unitary, affiliated, consolidated, or combined tax
grouping with the Primary Person, under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6,
or otherwise), and (iii) pursuant to any contract entered into on or before
Completion; provided, at all times, the total amount payable by the Seller
pursuant to this Clause 19.2 shall be limited to the Consideration.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   19.3 | No later than seven (7) days following the Zhongshan Transfer
(or sooner if required under applicable PRC law or practice), the Seller shall
file all Tax Returns that are applicable under PRC laws in connection with the
Zhongshan Transfer, which shall be true, accurate and complete in all
respects, and timely pay all Taxes due and payable with respect to such Tax
Returns (including with respect to any official assessments of the PRC
Taxation Authorities). The Seller shall engage a reputable third-party
valuation firm acceptable to the PRC Taxation Authorities in order to
determine the quantum of PRC Taxes due in respect of the Zhongshan Transfer.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

 

31  

  

   19.4 | The Seller shall not make any filing with the PRC Taxation
Authorities seeking to apply the "special tax treatment" under Circular 59,
Public Notice 4 or other similar PRC laws to the Zhongshan Transfer and shall
not seek to defer the filing of any Tax Returns or the payment of any Tax
arising from the Zhongshan Transfer to a time after the Completion Date.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   19.5 | For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall be responsible for
all PRC transfer taxes and related filings arising as a result of the
Zhongshan Transfer.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   19.6 | The Seller shall provide to the Purchaser final, accurate copies
of all Tax Returns relating to the Zhongshan Transfer, along with written
confirmation of full payment of all applicable PRC Taxes, within ten (10)
Business Days of such filing and payment and, in any event, not later than the
Completion Date. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that it is solely
responsible for all PRC Taxes arising as a result of the Zhongshan Transfer,
and in the event of any action taken by the PRC Taxation Authorities in
respect of the Zhongshan Transfer, the Seller shall deal with such action
promptly and shall not unreasonably delay any settlement in respect of such
action.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   19.7 | On or before the Completion Date, the Seller will confirm to the
Purchaser in writing Luvata Far East S.r.l.'s current tax basis (pursuant to
applicable PRC Tax law) in respect of its shareholding in Luvata Heat Transfer
Solutions (Wuxi) Co. Ltd.. In addition, promptly following receipt of a
reasonable written request from the Purchaser, the Seller will provide any
reasonably requested documents, returns, reports or other filings relating to
the direct and indirect transfers of Luvata Heat Transfer Solutions
(Zhongshan) Co., Ltd. and Luvata Heat Transfer Solutions (Wuxi) Co. Ltd.
contemplated by this Agreement.

   20. | Confidentiality  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   20.1 | Save as expressly provided in Clause 20.2, the Seller undertakes
that it shall treat as confidential the provisions of the Transaction

Documents and, with effect from Completion, all information it possesses
relating to the Target Companies.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   20.2 | Save as expressly provided in Clause 20.2, the Purchaser shall,

agent(s) and/or bank(s) and/or financial institution(s) lending money or
making other banking facilities available to the Purchaser (or any member of
the Purchaser\'s Group) for the acquisition of the Shares, and such rights may

Seller may unless it receives written notice of enforcement of the relevant
security interest, deal with the Purchaser in connection with all matters
arising under this Agreement. If the Purchaser assigns in accordance with this
Clause 22.2 , the Seller's liability shall be limited to the amount that would

in the absence of any such requirement to make a deduction or withholding.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   23.2 | Where any payment is made under Clauses 11.4 (Payment for
Leakage) and that sum is subject to a charge to Taxation in the hands of the
Purchaser, the sum payable shall be increased to such sum as will ensure that

the sum that it would have received in the absence of such a charge to
Taxation.

   24. | Further Assurance

accordance with English law.

37  

  

   35.2 | The Parties agree that if any claim, dispute or difference of
whatever nature arises under or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document (including a claim, dispute or difference regarding its
existence, termination or validity or any nonâ€‘contractual obligations arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document)
(a "Dispute"), the provisions of this Clause 35 shall apply. A Party may
notify the other Party in writing of a Dispute (a "Dispute Notice"), whereupon
the Parties shall attempt to resolve the Dispute. If a full and final binding
written agreement (a "Settlement") in settlement of any elements of the
Dispute has not been entered into during the period of twenty (20) Business
Days following the date of service of the Dispute Notice (the "Resolution
Period"), a Party shall be entitled to resort to arbitration under this

Party.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   35.3 | All Disputes which are unresolved pursuant to Clause 35.2 and

   35.4 | The arbitrators shall have the power to grant any legal or
equitable remedy or relief available under the applicable law, including
injunctive relief (whether interim and/or final) and specific performance and
any measures ordered by the arbitrators may be specifically enforced by any
court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree that a Party may have
recourse to any court of competent jurisdiction to seek interim or provisional
measures pending the determination of any Dispute by arbitration, including

request shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or a
waiver of the right to arbitrate. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of
the LCIA Rules, the Parties agree that no Party may have recourse to any court
of competent jurisdiction: (i) for final determination by that court of any
substantive issue or question of law arising in the course of the arbitration,
or (ii) to appeal any question of law arising out of any award made in the
arbitration.  
---|--- 
  

  

  

   35.5 | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, each Party: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any person
in any claims or causes of action, or dispute of any kind or description,

against any of the Financing Sources (which defined term for the purposes of
this provision shall include any Financing Source and its respective
affiliates, equityholders, members, partners, officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors and representatives involved in the financing contemplated by
any financing commitment letters ("Financing Letters")) in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing Letters or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other
than the federal and New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan

forth in the Financing Letters, all claims or causes of action (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the
Financing Sources in any way relating to the Financing Letters or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules or
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising
out of or relating in any way to the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, (A) the Seller and its affiliates shall not have any rights or
claims against the Financing Sources relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein, or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith,
including any Dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
Letters or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and (B) no
Financing Source shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or
otherwise) to the Seller or its affiliates for any obligations or liabilities
of any Party under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, including any Dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Financing Letters or the performance thereof or the financings

enforced by the Financing Sources and shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of the Seller.

respect of those Seller's Lenders who are, or will be, Stock Consideration
