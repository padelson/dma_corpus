Time_ ").

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth on _Exhibit
B_ hereto, and as so amended

 



      
 

 



 

and restated shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until further amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except the references to
Merger Subs name shall be replaced by references to the name set forth in the
form of certificate of incorporation as set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto,
until further amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable
Law.

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation,
incapacity or removal: ( _i_ ) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and ( _ii_ ) the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Company and Merger
Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Parties or any holder of any securities of the Company or
Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) All shares of Company Stock that are owned, directly or indirectly, by
Parent, the Company (including shares held as treasury stock or otherwise) or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

(b) Each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares ( _i_ ) to be canceled in accordance
with _Section 2.5(a)_, and ( _ii_ ) subject to the provisions of _Section
2.8_) shall at the Effective Time be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, subject to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 



 

(c) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock converted into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of ( _i_ ) a certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") or ( _ii_ ) shares of Company Stock held
in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except (subject to _Section 2.8_) the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest, subject to compliance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 2.9_.

 



 

(d) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (
_a_ ) the Effective Time and ( _b_ ) any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.1_, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or
a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment, or other similar

 



      
 

 



 

transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date
within said period, then the Merger Consideration and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide Parent and the holders of Company Stock (including Company Stock
Options exercisable for Company Stock) the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this _Section
2.6_ shall be construed to permit any Party to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion
of Company Stock pursuant to _Section 2.5_, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a holder of Parent Common Stock. All fractional shares to which a single
record holder of Company Stock would be otherwise entitled to receive shall be
aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places. In lieu
of any such fractional shares, each holder of Company Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to be paid
an amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the
product of ( _a_ ) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock and
( _b_ ) the Parent Stock Price. As soon as practicable after the determination
of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Stock in lieu
of any fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent
shall make available such amounts, without interest, to the holders of Company
Stock entitled to receive such cash.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled in
accordance with _Section 2.5(a)_) and that are held by any Person who is
entitled to demand and has properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Appraisal Shares_
") shall not be converted into the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.5_, but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled
to payment by the Surviving Corporation of the "fair value" of such Appraisal
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then
the right of such holder to be paid the "fair value" of such holders
Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.5_. The
Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
received by the Company. Parent shall have the right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 2.9 _Exchange of Company Stock_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange
agreement with a nationally recognized bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
Prior to or as of the Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent
(i) cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the Cash Consideration and
(ii) shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient in order for the Exchange Agent
to distribute the aggregate Stock Consideration, and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time,
any dividends or distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)_ which had not theretofore been surrendered for
exchange pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_ (such cash, shares of Parent Common
Stock and dividends or other distributions with respect thereto are
collectively referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time
to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 2.7_. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger
Consideration to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.5_ out of the Exchange
Fund. Except as provided in _Section 2.9(h)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the fifth Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, ( _x_ ) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form) and ( _y_ ) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as
practicable, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied
by the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by such
Certificate, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be
in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ (after
taking into account all other Certificates surrendered by such holder pursuant
to this _Section 2.9(b)(i)_), (C) any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)(i)_ and (D) cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.7_, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made and shares may be issued to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article II_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record
of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Stock were converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5_ shall automatically
upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by
such Book-Entry Shares, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested) representing,
in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_
(after taking into account all other Book-Entry Shares converted by such
holder pursuant to this _Section 2.9(b)(ii)_), (C) any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)(ii)_ and (D) cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section
2.7_, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be canceled. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any
Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificate formerly representing Company Stock, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant
to _Section 2.7_, until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
this _Article II_. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, ( _A_ ) at the time of
delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.9(b)(i)_, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock, and ( _B_ ) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)(i)_, and a payment date subsequent
to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.9(b)(i)_, payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Subject to applicable Law, there shall be paid to
the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article II_, without interest, ( _A_ )
at the time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)(ii)_, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, and ( _B_ ) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the time of such delivery
by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)(ii)_, and a payment date
subsequent to the time of such delivery by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.9(b)(ii)_, payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in
the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Stock (other than the right to receive dividends or other distributions, if
any, in accordance with _Section 2.9(c)_). After the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Stock are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holder of
Company Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for
the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions with respect
to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section 2.9(c)_.

 



 

(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 



 

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable and customary amount as Parent
or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or other
distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to _Section 2.9(c)_ had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been
surrendered as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment income or
gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company
Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its
request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to
the benefit of holders of Company Stock; _provided_ , _further_ , that any
investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated

 



      
 

 



 

A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock pursuant to this
_Article II_. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange
Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to
be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit
cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest
in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof be cancelled and cease at
the Effective Time to represent an option with respect to shares of Company
Stock, and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Stock Option to
receive a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of
( _i_ ) the total number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option multiplied by ( _ii_ ) the excess, if any, of ( _A_ ) the Merger
Consideration (with the Stock Consideration calculated as the Parent Stock
Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio) over ( _B_ ) the exercise price per
share of such Company Stock Option, without any interest thereon and subject
to all applicable withholding. Any such payment shall be paid in a lump sum as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than ten
Business Days following the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Company Stock Option that has an exercise price per share of Common Stock that
is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

 



 

(b) _Company RSUs_. As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested, shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted, without any action
on the part of any holder thereof, into a cash-settled restricted stock unit
award (an " _Assumed RSU_ ") covering Parent Common Stock in accordance with
this _Section 2.11(b)_. Each such Assumed RSU as so assumed and converted
shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions
as applied to the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (but
taking into account that settlement of such Assumed RSUs, if and to the extent
the Assumed RSUs become vested, shall be solely in the form a cash payment
equal to the value of the shares of Parent Common

 



       
 

 



 

Stock covered thereby and any other changes thereto provided for in this
Agreement), including the requirement for continued employment with Parent,
the Company or a Subsidiary thereof. As of the Effective Time, each such
Assumed RSU as so assumed and converted shall be an award of cash-settled
restricted stock units covering that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the
number of shares of Company Stock then underlying such Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by ( _ii_ ) the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio.

 



 

(c) _Company PSUs_. As of the Effective Time, each Company PSU (other than a
Company Supplemental PSU) that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically become immediately vested at "target" level
of performance (as set forth in the applicable award agreement), and each
Company PSU shall be cancelled and cease at the Effective Time to represent a
right with respect to shares of Company Stock and shall be converted, without
any action on the part of any holder thereof, into the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation a cash payment equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the
total "target" number of shares of Company Stock then underlying such Company
PSUs (as set forth in the applicable award agreement) multiplied by ( _ii_ )
the Merger Consideration (with the Stock Consideration calculated as the
Parent Stock Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio), without any interest
thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Any such payment shall be
paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no
event later than ten Business Days following the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) _Company Supplemental PSUs_. As of the Effective Time, each Company
Supplemental PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and cease at the Effective Time to represent a right with
respect to shares of Company Stock and, to the extent that any such Company
Supplemental PSUs shall have satisfied their performance conditions and vested
at the Effective Time (as determined in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable award agreement), such vested Company
Supplemental PSUs shall be converted, without any action on the part of any
holder thereof, into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation a
cash payment equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the total number of shares of
Company Stock then underlying such vested Company Supplemental PSUs and
multiplied by ( _ii_ ) the Merger Consideration (with the Stock Consideration
calculated as the Parent Stock Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio),
without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Any
such payment shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time but in no event later than five Business Days following the
Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Supplemental PSU that
does not satisfy its performance conditions at the Effective Time shall be
cancelled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and
have no further force or effect.

 



 

(e) _Company DSUs_. Each Company DSU that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and converted, without any
action on the part of any holder thereof, into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation a cash payment equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the total
number of shares of Company Stock then underlying such Company DSU multiplied
by ( _ii_ ) the Merger Consideration (with the Stock Consideration calculated
as the Parent Stock Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio), without any
interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Any such payment
shall be paid in a lump sum at the Effective Time in a manner consistent with
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Notice to Holders_. Not later than the Closing Date, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to make available to those individuals who,
immediately following the Effective Time, will be the holders of Assumed RSUs
any required notices setting forth such holders rights relating to such
assumed equity awards and stating that the related Company RSUs have been
assumed by Parent and converted as provided in this _Section 2.11_, and such
awards shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions subject, in
each case, to the adjustments required by this _Section 2.11_ after giving
effect to the Merger and the terms of the relevant Company Equity Plan and
related award agreements.

 



 

(g) _Certain Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent
shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company
Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company Supplemental PSUs and
Company DSUs as provided in this _Section 2.11_.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Treatment of Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each
unexercised Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be assumed by Parent and converted into a Parent Warrant in
accordance with _Section 7.13_. Parent shall reserve for future issuance a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock that will be subject to the Parent Warrants.

 



 

Section 2.13 _Transaction Structure_. If Parent determines in good faith that
it desires to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement utilizing
a transaction structure different than that reflected in this Agreement, then
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to make such modifications to this
Agreement as shall be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the
transaction utilizing such other transaction structure (it being agreed and
understood that Parent shall be permitted to either ( _a_ ) substitute for
Merger Sub a newly-created wholly-owned Subsidiary of Sinclair Television
Group, Inc. (" _STG_ ") which, upon executing and delivering a joinder
agreement substantially similar to the Joinder Agreement, shall thereafter be
deemed to be "Merger Sub" for all purposes under this Agreement or ( _b_ )
contribute all of the shares of the Merger Sub to STG); _provided_ , that the
Company shall only be obligated to make such modifications if there is no
change to the Merger Consideration and the making of such modifications would
not impair or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. It is the intention of the Parties that the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, will not require a vote of the holders of Parent Common Stock or
Parent Class B Stock, and each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to avoid taking any action that would reasonably be expected to
require such vote to be obtained.

 



 

Section 2.14 _Withholding_. Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

(a) Each Subsidiary of the Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each
Minority Investment Entity, is duly incorporated or otherwise duly organized,
validly existing and (where such concept is recognized) in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, except, in the
case of any such Subsidiary or Minority Investment Entity, as applicable,

and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each Minority Investment Entity has all
corporate, limited liability company or

 



      
 

 



 

comparable powers required to carry on its business as now conducted, except

amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement and giving effect to such amendment or supplement), each Company
SEC Document complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as the case may be,
and none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) in compliance in all material
respects with Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since December 31, 2015, the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed to the Companys auditors and audit committee ( _i_ ) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting and ( _ii_ ) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries who have a significant role in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Financial Statements_. The consolidated financial statements of
the Company included or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents
(including all related notes and schedules thereto) when filed complied as to
form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto in effect
at the time of such filing and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as of the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective
periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described
therein, including the notes thereto) and were prepared in accordance with
GAAP (except, in the case of the unaudited statements, for normal year-end
adjustments and for the absence of notes) applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes
thereto). Such consolidated financial statements have been prepared from, and
are in accordance with, the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. From December 31, 2016 to the date of this Agreement, there has
not been any material change in the accounting methods used by the Company.

 



 

Section 3.9 _Information Supplied_. The information relating to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to be contained in, or incorporated by reference in, the
Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included,
including any amendments or supplements thereto and any other document
incorporated or referenced therein, will not, on the date the Proxy Statement

(a) For a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each
former and present director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, a " _Company Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs, expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any actual or threatened claim to the fullest extent permitted
by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim with
respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer,
director, or other fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of
any Person if such service was at the request of or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by Law and
as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) or any indemnification agreement as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and made available by the Company to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement. All rights to elimination of
liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in
effect as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the Company Indemnified
Parties shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all the terms thereof.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Company Indemnified
Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification
pursuant to this _Section 6.3_, the provisions of this _Section 6.3_ shall
continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of
all claims relating thereto. No Company Indemnified Party shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened
claim in respect of which indemnification has been sought by such Company
Indemnified Party hereunder without the prior written consent of Parent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

(b) For a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, Parent,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, shall cause to be
maintained in effect the provisions in the certificates of incorporation and
bylaws and comparable organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation
and each Subsidiary of the Company (or in such documents of any successor
thereto) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement
of expenses no less favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties than in
effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, during such six
year period, shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
individual who immediately before the Effective Time was a Company Indemnified
Party, except as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either ( _i_ )
continue to maintain in effect for a period of no less than six years after
the Effective Time the Companys directors and officers insurance policies
(the " _D andO Insurance_") in place as of the date of this Agreement or ( _ii_
) purchase comparable DandO Insurance (from a carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys DandO Insurance carrier) for such six-year
period, in each case, with coverage for the persons who are covered by the
Companys existing DandO Insurance, with

 



      
 

 



 

terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable to
the insured individuals as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect
to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess
of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year
(the " _Premium Cap_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount necessary
to procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Premium Cap, the Company may
purchase the most advantageous policy available for an amount not to exceed
the Premium Cap. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase, prior to
the Effective Time, a prepaid "tail policy" for a period of no more than six
years after the Effective Time with coverage for the persons who are covered
by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions
and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as the
Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring
prior to the Effective Time, in which event Parent shall cease to have any
obligations under the first sentence of this _Section 6.3(c)_; _provided_
that the aggregate premium for such policies shall not exceed the Premium Cap;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount of annual premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Premium Cap, the
Company may procure and maintain for such six-year period the most
advantageous policy available for an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.
In the event the Company elects to purchase such a "tail policy," the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect for a period of no
less than six years after the Effective Time and continue to honor its
obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns ( _i_ ) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or ( _ii_ ) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to succeed to or assume the
applicable obligations of such Party set forth in this _Section 6.3_.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.3_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each of the Company Indemnified Parties and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by Contract, at Law or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing thereafter for
twelve months or if shorter, the period of employment of the relevant Employee
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide, each Employee
(excluding any Employees represented by labor unions and/or covered by the
Collective Bargaining Agreements) as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time who continues employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, following the Closing (the " _Continuing
Employees_ "), with ( _i_ ) base salary or other base cash compensation that
are at least the same as, in the aggregate, the base salary or other base cash
compensation that were provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to

 



      
 

 



 

the Effective Time, ( _ii_ ) short-term annual cash incentive compensation
opportunities (other than equity or equity-based compensation) that are no
less favorable than the short-term annual cash incentive compensation
opportunities (other than equity or equity-based compensation) that were
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
and ( _iii_ ) employee benefits (including, but not limited to, any severance,
retention and any other termination pay and benefits plans, practices and
policies applicable to each Continuing Employee) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those employee benefits as are provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as provided
for in _Section 6.4(c)_, ( _x_ ) Parent shall cause to be maintained through
December 31, 2017 those 2017 annual (or other short-term) cash incentive award
programs covering the Employees substantially in the form as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and ( _y_ ) from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, honor the accrued and vested obligations of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under the Company
Plans. The compensation and benefits for Continuing Employees who are covered
by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be provided in accordance with the
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement as amended, extended or terminated
from time to time in accordance with its terms and applicable Law. The Company
and Parent agree to take the actions described on Section 6.4(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
shall use reasonable best efforts to comply in all material respects with all
notice, consultation, effects bargaining or other bargaining obligations to
any labor union, labor organization, works council or group of employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger. Each of Parent
and the Company agree to reasonably cooperate with each other in order to
comply with such obligations.

 



 

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit
accrual (but not for benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans or
post-retirement benefit plans) under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) in which Continuing Employees may become
eligible to participate in after the Closing (the " _New Benefit Plans_ "),
each Continuing Employee shall be credited with the same amount of service as
was credited by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under
similar or comparable Company Plans in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent
such credit would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation). In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to
the terms and conditions of the applicable New Benefit Plans, ( _i_ ) with
respect to any New Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employees may be
eligible to participate following the Closing, each Continuing Employee will
be eligible to participate in such New Benefit Plans, without any waiting
time, to the extent coverage under such New Benefit Plans replaces coverage
under a similar or comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee
was participating immediately before such commencement of participation and (
_ii_ ) for purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to, for the applicable plan year in which the
Closing occurs, (A) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements of such New Benefit Plan to be waived

 



      
 

 



 

for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent
any such exclusions or requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any
similar or comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) subject to the
terms and conditions of the New Benefit Plans, Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Company Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees
participation in the corresponding New Benefit Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Benefit
Plan.

 



 

(d) Annual short-term cash bonuses in respect of the year that the Closing
Date occurs, if any, shall be paid to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in amounts calculated on the basis of actual performance for the
applicable performance period determined and calculated in substantially the
same manner as with respect to prior performance periods, with such payments
to be made as soon as practicable after the finalization of the audited
financial statements for the applicable fiscal year (the " _Bonus Payment
Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the employment of any such employee
who is eligible for an annual short-term cash bonus is terminated by Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, without
Cause (as defined in the Companys 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan) prior to
the payment of the annual short-term cash bonus in respect of 2017, such
employee shall be eligible to receive payment of an annual short-term cash
bonus in respect of 2017, in amounts calculated on the basis of actual
performance for the 2017 performance period determined and calculated in
substantially the same manner as with respect to prior performance periods,
with such amount to be prorated to reflect the portion of the 2017 performance
period that the terminated employee was employed by Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries prior to the date of termination of
employment and paid on the applicable Bonus Payment Date. In all cases covered

financial statements for each relevant period and shall make customary
adjustments in the amount of such accruals in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(e) The terms of this _Section 6.4_ are included for the sole benefit of the

Employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any
participant or beneficiary in any Company Plan or any other Person or
Governmental Authority (whether as a third party beneficiary or otherwise)
other than the Parties hereto. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.4_ shall
( _i_ ) constitute or be deemed to constitute establishment of or an amendment
to or termination of any Company Plan or other compensation or benefit plan,
policy, program, Contract or arrangement, ( _ii_ ) obligate Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to retain the
employment or service of (or provide any term or condition of employment or

amending, modifying or terminating any Company Plan, Parent Plan, New Benefit
Plan or other benefit or compensation plan, policy, program, Contract or
arrangement, to the extent such amendment, modification, or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, policy, program, Contract, or
arrangement.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after
the date hereof, the Company will make available to Parent true and correct
copies of preliminary Section 280G calculations (based on the assumptions set
forth in the applicable calculations) with respect to each "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) who is reasonably
likely to receive payments or benefits in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that possibly would not be deductible under
Section 280G of the Code.

within one Business Day after the date hereof; ( _b_ ) cause Merger Sub to

 _COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY_

 



 

Section 7.1 _Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, including ( _i_ )
preparing and filing, in consultation with the other Parties, as promptly as
reasonably practicable with any Governmental Authority or other Third Party
all documentation to effect all necessary, proper or advisable filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents and ( _ii_ ) obtaining and maintaining all
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority or other
Third Party, in each case, that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Station Disposition) (whether or
not such approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations are conditions to the consummation of the Merger pursuant to
_Article VIII_).

 



 

(b) In connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, to the extent requested by Parent, the Parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to consummate the disposition of the Company Stations
identified on _Section 7.1(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter in the manner
set forth on _Section 7.1(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter and such
contracts and assets related thereto as shall be reasonably determined by
Parent (such disposition, the " _Station Disposition_ "), whether or not such
dispositions are necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the approvals,
consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations
otherwise required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority to
consummate and make effective the Merger. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Company shall, and

 



      
 

 



 

shall cause its Representatives to, cooperate in good faith with Parent and
its Representatives and supply Parent and its Representatives with
information, and enter into such agreements and documents, necessary or
appropriate to facilitate the Station Disposition. Parent shall be entitled to
direct, in consultation with the Company, the process for the Station
Disposition. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 7.1(b)_, none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
obligated to consummate a Station Disposition, unless such Station Disposition
is contingent upon the Closing.

 



 

(c) To the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, assign the options under option agreements with the Company
Sharing Companies and their equityholders to one or more of Parents
Affiliates or other designees of Parent, and take such other actions
reasonably requested by Parent to cause one or more of the Company Stations
licensed to a Company Sharing Company and subject to a Sharing Agreement with
the Company or its Subsidiaries to be acquired by one or more of Parents
Affiliates or other designees, as applicable (each such assignment and/or
acquisition, a " _Sharing Station Acquisition_ "). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, cooperate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives and supply Parent and its Representatives with information,
and enter into such agreements and documents, necessary or appropriate to
facilitate each Sharing Station Acquisition. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 7.1(c)_, none of the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to consummate a Sharing Station
Acquisition, unless such Sharing Station Acquisition is contingent upon the
Closing.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall ( _i_ ) make, as promptly as reasonably practicable
appropriate filings of Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
that the filing by each of Parent and the Company of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Merger shall be made within
10 Business Days of the date of this Agreement, unless a later date is agreed
to in writing by both Parent and the Company and ( _ii_ ) make, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, the FCC Applications with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the FCC Applications with
respect to the Merger shall be made within 20 Business Days of the date of
this Agreement, unless a later date is agreed to in writing by both Parent and
the Company. Each of the Company and Parent shall supply as promptly as
practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the foregoing, and to take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods regarding the foregoing as soon as practicable. The Company and Parent
shall each request early termination of the waiting period with respect to the
Merger, the Stations Divestitures and any Sharing Station Acquisitions under
the HSR Act. The Company and Parent shall each pay 50% of the filing fees
payable under the HSR Act and FCC filing fees by the Company, Parent and each
of their Subsidiaries relating to the Merger, irrespective of whether the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.

 



 

(e) Except as prohibited by applicable Law or Order, each of Parent and the
Company shall ( _i_ ) cooperate and consult with each other in connection with
any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by or before a

 



      
 

 



 

Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, including by
allowing the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance
and comment on drafts of filings and submissions, ( _ii_ ) promptly inform the
other Party of (and if in writing, supply to the other Party) any substantive
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,
the FCC or any other similar Governmental Authority and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, ( _iii_ ) consult with each other prior to taking any material
position with respect to the filings under the HSR Act (or any other
Competition Law), the Communications Act and the FCC Rules in discussions with
or filings to be submitted to any Governmental Authority, ( _iv_ ) permit the
other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other in connection with, any analyses, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be submitted to any Governmental
Authority with respect to filings under the HSR Act (or any other Competition
Law), the Communications Act and the FCC Rules and ( _v_ ) coordinate with the
other in preparing and exchanging such information and promptly provide the
other (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or
submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such Party with
any Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby under the HSR Act (or any other Competition Law), the
Communications Act and the FCC Rules; _provided_ that Parent shall be entitled
to direct, in consultation with the Company, the timing for making, and
approve (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) the content of, any
filings with or presentations or submissions to any Governmental Authority
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and to take
the lead in the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meetings with,
and the conducting of negotiations with, Governmental Authorities relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(f) The Company and Parent acknowledge that, to the extent reasonably
necessary to expedite the grant by the FCC of any application for renewal of
any FCC License with respect to any Company Station and thereby to facilitate
the grant of the FCC Consent with respect to such Company Station, each of the
Company, Parent and their applicable Subsidiaries shall be permitted to enter
into tolling agreements with the FCC to extend the statute of limitations for
the FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against such Company
Station in connection with ( _i_ ) any pending complaints that such Company
Station aired programming that contained obscene, indecent or profane material
or ( _ii_ ) any other enforcement matters against such Company Station with
respect to which the FCC may permit the Company or Parent (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries) to enter into a tolling agreement.

 



 

(g) If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the original
effective periods of the FCC Consent, and neither party shall have terminated
this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company and Parent shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain one or more extensions of the
effective period of the FCC Consent to permit consummation of the transactions
hereunder. Upon receipt of the FCC Consent, the Company and Parent shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the FCC Consent
to permit consummation of the transactions hereunder. No extension of the FCC
Consent shall limit the right of the Company and Parent to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the applicable
Governmental Authority, each of the Company and Parent shall ( _i_ ) to the
extent reasonably practicable, not participate in or attend any meeting, or
engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in
respect of the Merger (including with respect to any of the actions referred
to in _Section 7.1(a)_) without the other, ( _ii_ ) to the extent reasonably
practicable, give the other reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or
conversation and ( _iii_ ) in the event one such Party is prohibited by
applicable Law or Order or by the applicable Governmental Authority from
participating or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such
conversation, keep the non-participating Party reasonably apprised with
respect thereto.

 



 

(i) Subject to _Section 7.1(j)_, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
take action to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably practicable, including ( _i_ ) the prompt use of its reasonable
best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
permanent, preliminary or temporary Order that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including (A) the defense through litigation on the merits of
any claim asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by any Person,
including any Governmental Authority, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such transactions, ( _B_ ) the
proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell, lease, license or
otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly
to effect the sale, lease, license, disposal and holding separate of, such
assets, rights, product lines, categories of assets or businesses or other
operations or interests therein of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) (and the
entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant
Governmental Authority giving effect thereto, including the entry into hold
separate arrangements, terminating, assigning or modifying Contracts (or
portions thereof) or other business relationships, accepting restrictions on
business operations and entering into commitments and obligations)
(hereinafter referred to as the " _Station Divestitures_ ") and ( _C_ ) the
proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to take such other actions,
and promptly to effect such other actions (and the entry into agreements with,
and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Authority giving effect
thereto, including the entry into hold separate arrangements, terminating,
assigning or modifying Contracts (or portions thereof) or other business
relationships, accepting restrictions on business operations and entering into
commitments and obligations) (each an " _Approval Action_ "), including, in
the case of clause (B) and (C), the Approval Actions listed on Section 7.1(i)
of the Parent Disclosure Letter, in each case if such action is necessary or
advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or
threatened ( _x_ ) commencement of any Proceeding in any forum or ( _y_ )
issuance of any Order that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
any Governmental Authority and ( _ii_ ) the prompt use of its reasonable best
efforts to take, in the event that any permanent or preliminary Order is
entered or issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued,
in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Station
Divestitures) in accordance with its terms unlawful or that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Station
Divestitures), any and all steps (including the appeal thereof and the posting
of a bond) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse,

 



      
 

 



 

suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened
Order so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to
that contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing set forth in this
_Section 7.1_ or otherwise in this Agreement shall:

 



 

(i) require, or be construed to require the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any Approval Action, unless
such Approval Action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger;

 



 

(ii) permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to agree or consent to or
approve (without the prior consent of Parent, which need only be granted to
the extent otherwise required hereunder) any Approval Action; or

 



 

(iii) require or be construed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
agree to take or consent to the taking of any Approval Actions other than (x)
the Approval Actions listed on Section 7.1(i) of the Parent Disclosure Letter
and (y) such other Approval Actions (not involving the divestitures of Parent
Stations or Company Stations or the modification or termination of Sharing
Agreements or related option agreements) that would not reasonably be expected
to result in an Approval Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(k) For purposes of this _Section 7.1_, " _Approval Material Adverse Effect_
" means a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of
operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including, after
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 



 

Section 7.2 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders  Meetings_.

 



 

(a) Registration Statement and Prospectus.

 



 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, and in any event
within 30 Business Days following the date of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the Registration
Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included. Each of Parent and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC, to have the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to
keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning it as may reasonably be requested by the other party in
connection with such actions and the preparation of the Proxy Statement and
the Registration Statement. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to stockholders of the Company promptly after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act.

 



 

(ii) All filings by the Company or Parent with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and all mailings to the stockholders of the
Company in connection with the Merger shall be subject to the prior review and
comment by the other party.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Each of Parent and the Company shall (A) as promptly as practicable
notify the other of (1) the receipt of any comments from the SEC and all other
written correspondence and oral communications with the SEC relating to the
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement (including the time when the
Registration Statement becomes effective and the issuance of any stop order or
suspension of qualifications of the Parent Share Issuance) and (2) any request
by the SEC for any amendment or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement or for additional information with respect thereto and
(B) supply each other with copies of (1) all correspondence between it or any
of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the Merger and
(2) all Orders of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement.

 



 

(iv) Each of Parent and the Company shall ensure that none of the information
supplied by or on its behalf for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
(A) the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement is
filed with the SEC, at each time at which it is amended and at the time it
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading and (B) the Proxy Statement will, at
the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time
of the meeting of the stockholders of the Company (the " _Company Stockholders
 Meeting_") contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.

 



 

(v) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, directors
or officers is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, which is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
or the Registration Statement, so that neither of such documents would include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company and Parent.

 



 

(b) The Company shall duly give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable following the date the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, for the
purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval and shall, subject to
_Section 7.3_, (i) recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this
Agreement and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation and (ii) use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit such adoption and obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval. Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called
and noticed, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent other than (x) to the
extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders in advance of a vote on the
adoption of this Agreement, or (y) if, as of the time for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares
of Company Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting; _provided_ that

 



       
 

 



 

in the case of either clause (x) or (y), the Company Stockholders Meeting
shall only be adjourned or postponed for a minimum period of time reasonable
under the circumstances (it being understood that any such adjournment or
postponement shall not affect the Companys obligation to hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting as aforesaid). The Company shall ensure that the Company
Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders
Meeting are solicited in compliance with applicable Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Companys obligations pursuant to this
_Section 7.2(b)_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition
Proposal or by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with _Section 9.1(d)(iii)_.

 



 

(c) Except to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 7.3(e)_, (i) the
Company Board shall recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the
Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Company Board
has recommended that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of approval
of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders
Meeting and (iii) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of its board of directors
that stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.3 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 



 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_, and except as otherwise specifically provided for in this
Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and
shall not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, employees or
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, ( _i_ ) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer
which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Acquisition Proposal, ( _ii_ ) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives) any nonpublic information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, in connection with any Company Acquisition
Proposal, ( _iii_ ) approve or recommend, or make any public statement
approving or recommending, a Company Acquisition Proposal or, subject to
_Section 7.3(e)_, effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, ( _iv_ )
enter into any letter of intent, merger agreement or other similar agreement
providing for a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) (each an " _Alternative Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "), ( _v_ ) submit any Company Acquisition Proposal to a vote of
the stockholders of the Company or ( _vi_ ) resolve or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_, if, prior
to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company receives
a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal, which has not resulted from
a material breach of this _Section 7.3_, that the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, ( _i_ ) is or would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Company Proposal and ( _ii_ ) failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to

 



      
 

 



 

be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
then the Company may, in response to such Company Acquisition Proposal,
furnish nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the Person or group (or any of their Representatives) making such Company
Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with such
Person or group and their Representatives regarding such Company Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that ( _x_ ) prior to furnishing any nonpublic
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person or
group or their respective Representatives, the Company enters into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group making such
Company Acquisition Proposal and ( _y_ ) promptly (but not more than one
Business Day) after furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person,
the Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such
nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished to Parent or its
Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Companys Representatives
may in any event inform a Person or group that has made or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, is considering making, a Company Acquisition Proposal of the
provisions of this _Section 7.3_.

 



 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day)
notify Parent after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry
or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries by any Person who has made or would reasonably be
expected to make a Company Acquisition Proposal and provide to Parent copies
of all material correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to such Company Acquisition
Proposal or such inquiry or proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity
of the Person making the proposal or offer, the material terms and conditions
of any such proposal or offer or the nature of the information requested
pursuant to such inquiry or request. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within one Business
Day), regarding any material changes to the status and material terms of any
such proposal or offer (including any material amendments thereto or any
material change to the scope or material terms or conditions thereof), and
provide to Parent copies of all material correspondence and written materials
sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to such
proposal or offer.

 



 

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall
direct its Representatives to, immediately (i) cease any existing discussions
or negotiations with any Person with respect to a Company Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) terminate access for any Person (other than Parent, its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives) to any data room and (iii)
request the return or destruction of any non-public information provided to
any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives) in connection with a potential Company Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the
time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and, in the case of a Company
Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited after the date of this Agreement and
that did not result from a material breach of this _Section 7.3_, terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(iii)_ and concurrently pay the fee
required by _Section 9.3_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement in
connection with a

 



      
 

 



 

Superior Company Proposal) if: ( _i_ ) ( _A_ ) a Company Acquisition Proposal
is made to the Company after the date of this Agreement and such Company
Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn prior to such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or ( _B_ ) there has been an Intervening Event; ( _ii_ )
in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board concludes in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Company Proposal; and ( _iii_ ) the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

 



 

(f) Prior to making any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into
any Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement, ( _i_ ) the Company Board shall
provide Parent at least four Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action, which notice shall specify, in reasonable
detail, the reasons therefor and, in the case of a Company Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such proposal, including a copy
of any proposed definitive agreement; ( _ii_ ) during the four Business Days
following such written notice, the Company Board and its Representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Company
Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable; and ( _iii_ ) at the end of the
four Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
legal counsel and outside financial advisors (and taking into account any
legally binding (if accepted by the Company) adjustment or modification of the
terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent), that, as applicable (
_A_ ) the Company Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Company
Proposal or ( _B_ ) the Intervening Event continues to warrant a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and, in each case, that failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws. After compliance with the foregoing
sentence, the Company shall have no further obligations under the foregoing
sentence, and the Company Board shall not be required to comply with such
obligations with respect to any other Superior Company Proposal or Intervening
Event.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to their stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated
by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 7.3(g)_ shall not permit the
Company Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except to the
extent otherwise permitted by this _Section 7.3_. For the avoidance of doubt,
any "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not constitute a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

Section 7.4 _No Solicitation by Parent_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_, Parent shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit any of
its officers, directors, employees or Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, ( _i_ ) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiry,

 



      
 

 



 

proposal or offer which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead

counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement
with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market
to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such
Party shall provide, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, an
opportunity to the other Party to review and comment on such press release or
other announcement in advance, and shall give reasonable consideration to all
reasonable comments suggested thereto. None of the limitations set forth in
this _Section 7.5_ shall apply to any disclosure of any information ( _a_ )

Section 7.6 _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify and provide copies to the other of ( _a_ ) any material
written notice from any Person alleging that the approval or consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, ( _b_ ) any written notice or
other communication from any Governmental Authority or securities exchange in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, ( _c_ ) any Proceeding or investigation, commenced or, to its
Knowledge, threatened against, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that would be
reasonably likely to ( _i_ ) prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or ( _ii_ ) result in
the failure of any condition to the Merger set forth in _Article VIII_ to be
satisfied, or ( _d_ ) the occurrence of any event which would or would be
reasonably likely to ( _i_ ) prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or ( _ii_ ) result in
the failure of any condition to the Merger set forth in _Article VIII_ to be
satisfied; _provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 7.6_ shall not ( _x_ ) affect or be deemed to modify any
representation, warranty, covenant, right, remedy, or condition to any
obligation of any Party hereunder or ( _y_ ) update any section of the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_, upon

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable advance notice and subject to applicable Law, (1) the Company shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent, its Affiliates and its
officers, agents, control persons, employees, consultants, professional
advisers (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors) ("
_Representatives_ ") reasonable access during normal business hours, to all of
its and its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, commitments, records,
officers and employees and, during such period the Company shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish to Parent all other information concerning
it, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective businesses, properties and
personnel (including for the purposes of Parent obtaining an insurance policy
relating to the Cubs Tax Dispute) as Parent may reasonably request and (2)
Parent shall afford the Company, its officers and employees reasonable access
during normal business hours, to Parents corporate level employees and
consider in good faith access to all other information and personnel
concerning it, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective businesses,
properties and personnel as the Company may reasonably request; _provided_
that the Party receiving such request may restrict the foregoing access and
the disclosure of information to the extent that, in the good faith judgment
of such Party, ( _i_ ) any Law applicable to such Party or its Subsidiaries
requires such Party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information, ( _ii_ ) the information is subject to
confidentiality obligations to a Third Party, ( _iii_ ) disclosure of any such
information or document could result in the loss of attorney-client privilege
or ( _iv_ ) such access would unreasonably disrupt the operations of such
Party or any of its Subsidiaries. Each Party shall use reasonable best efforts
to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 



 

(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to _Section 7.7(a)_,
each of Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause such partys
Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, which agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such steps as may be
required to cause any dispositions of Company Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Stock Exchange Listing of Parent Common Stock and De-listing of
Company Stock; Exchange Act Deregistration_. Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock issuable in the Parent Share Issuance
to be authorized for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall also use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent shall, with the reasonable cooperation of the Company, take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of the NYSE to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of

 



      
 

 



 

the Class A Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Class A Stock
and other securities of the Company under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Stockholder Litigation_. Each Party shall promptly notify the
other Party in writing of any litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is brought
against such Party, its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors
and shall keep the other Party informed on a reasonably current basis with
respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate, at its expense and subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, in the defense or settlement of any such litigation, and the
Company shall not settle any such litigation without the prior written consent
of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without
limiting in any way the Parties obligations under _Section 7.1_, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
cooperate in the defense or settlement of any litigation contemplated by this
_Section 7.10_.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts ( _a_ ) to take all action necessary so that no
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated hereby and ( _b_ ) if any such Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and
consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions specified in the
Commitment Letters or any Substitute Debt Financing (and, in any event, no
later than the time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to
_Section 2.2_), including using its reasonable best efforts to ( _i_ )( _A_ )
maintain in effect the Commitment Letters and comply with all of their
respective covenants and obligations thereunder, ( _B_ ) negotiate and,
assuming all conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 8.1 _and _Section
8.2_ hereof have been satisfied, enter into and deliver definitive agreements
with respect to the Financing reflecting the terms and conditions contained in
the Commitment Letters, so that such agreements are in effect no later than
the time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.2_
and (C) enforce their rights under the Commitment Letters and ( _ii_ ) satisfy
on a timely basis all the conditions to the Financing and the definitive
agreements related thereto that are in Parents (or its Subsidiaries)
control. In the event that all conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ have
been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or waived, and
the Closing should otherwise occur pursuant to _Section 2.2_, Parent and its
Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Persons
providing the Financing (the " _Debt Financing Parties_ ") to fund the
Financing at the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to keep the Company informed on a
current basis of the status of the Financing and material developments with
respect thereto and provide the Company promptly (and in no event later than
one Business Day) with copies of any material definitive agreements related to
the Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall promptly (and in
no event later than one Business Day) after obtaining knowledge thereof, give
the Company written notice of any ( _i_ ) breach or default by Parent, its
Affiliates, any Debt Financing Party or any other party to the Commitment
Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing (or any event or
circumstance, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would give rise
to any breach or default), ( _ii_ ) threatened or actual withdrawal,
repudiation, expiration, intention not to fund or termination of or relating
to the Commitment Letters or the Financing, ( _iii_ ) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letters or any
definitive document related to the Financing that could reasonably be expected
to affect the availability of the Financing at Closing or ( _i_ _v_ ) if for
any reason Parent in good faith no longer believes it will be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing needed to consummate the Merger at the
Effective Time. Parent may amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any
waiver under the Commitment Letters without the prior written approval of the
Company, _provided_ that Parent shall not, without the Companys prior written
consent, permit any such amendment, modification, assignment, termination or
waiver to be made to, or consent to or agree to any waiver of, any provision
of or remedy under the Commitment Letters which would ( _A_ ) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees
to be paid or original issue discount), ( _B_ ) impose new or additional
conditions to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the Financing or ( _C_ ) otherwise expand, amend, modify or
waive any provision of the Commitment Letters or the Financing in a manner
that in the case of this clause (C) would reasonably be expected to ( _I_ )
delay, prevent or make less likely the consummation of the Merger or the
funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing)
at the Effective Time, ( _II_ ) adversely impact the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against the Debt Financing Parties or any other parties to
the Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or (
_III_ ) adversely affect the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ further that the
Commitment Letters may be amended to add additional Financing Sources. In the
event that new commitment letters and/or fee letters are entered into in
accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification
of the Commitment Letters permitted pursuant to this _Section 7.12(b)_, such
new commitment letters and/or fee letters shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Financing" and deemed to be the "Commitment Letters" for all purposes of this
Agreement. Parent shall promptly (and in any event no later than one Business
Day) deliver to the Company true, correct and complete copies of any
termination, amendment, modification or replacement of the Commitment Letters.
If funds in the amounts set forth in the Commitment Letters, or any portion
thereof, become unavailable, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event to, ( _x_ )
notify the Company in writing thereof, ( _y_ ) use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain substitute financing sufficient to enable Parent to
consummate the payment of the aggregate Cash Consideration pursuant to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with the
terms hereof (the " _Substitute Debt Financing_ ") and ( _z_ ) use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain a new financing commitment letter
that provides for such Substitute Debt Financing and, promptly after execution
thereof (and, in any event, no later than one Business Day), deliver to the
Company

 



      
 

 



 

true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment letter and the related
fee letters and related definitive financing documents with respect to such
Substitute Debt Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such
Substitute Debt Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Financing" and any commitment letter for such Substitute Debt Financing shall
be deemed the "Commitment Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Commitment Letters.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that neither Parents
nor Merger Subs obligations hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon
Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the Financing, any Substitute Debt Financing or
any other financing.

 



 

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts
to, and to cause their Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to,
provide to Parent such customary cooperation as may be reasonably requested by
Parent to assist Parent in arranging the Financing, including:

 



 

(1) assisting in preparation for and participation in, upon reasonable advance
notice and at reasonable times, a reasonable number of meetings and calls

Financing), rating agency presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions
(including accounting due diligence sessions) and assisting Parent in

materials relating to the Financing authorizing the distribution of
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to prospective
lenders and identifying any portion of such information that constitutes
material, nonpublic information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or
their respective securities (in each case in accordance with customary
syndication practices) and containing a representation that (to the extent
accurate) the public-side version does not include material non-public
information about the Company and its Subsidiaries or their respective
securities and (B) customary materials for rating agency presentations for the
Financing;

 



 

(3) delivering to Parent the Required Financial Information;

 



 

(4) delivering to Parent and its potential financing sources as promptly as

with the preparation of customary disclosure and marketing materials, as
applicable, and assisting Parent in preparing pro forma ( _A_ ) balance sheets

case such period includes the end of the Companys fiscal year), ( _B_ )
income statements and related notes for the most recently completed fiscal
year, for the most recently completed interim period and for the twenty-four

Companys fiscal year), and (C) any other pro forma financial statements, and
for any periods, that would be required in accordance with Article 11 of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, including, without limitation,

customarily included in disclosure and marketing materials relating to the
Financing, prepared after giving effect to the transactions described in this
Agreement and the Commitment Letter as if such transactions had occurred as of
such date (in the case of such balance sheet) or at the beginning of such
period (in the case of such statements of income); provided that none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives shall be
responsible in any manner for information relating to the Parent and its
Subsidiaries or the proposed debt and equity capitalization that is required
for such pro forma financial information;

 



 

(5) causing its independent registered public accounting firm to provide
customary assistance with the due diligence activities of Parent and its

(7) assisting to identify the steps for repayment on the Closing Date of the
Company Indebtedness (other than any Company Indebtedness identified by the

Effective Time);

Closing Date;

 



 

 _provided_ that ( _i_ ) no such cooperation shall be required to the extent
that it would ( _A_ ) require the Company to take any action that in the good
faith judgment of the Company unreasonably interferes with the ongoing
business or operations of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, ( _B_ ) require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any fee, expense or other

or agree to any change or modification of any existing agreement or other

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
condition set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_, as applied to the Companys
obligations under this

 



       
 

 



 

 _Section 7.12(e)_, shall be deemed to be satisfied unless the Financing has
not been obtained as a direct result of the Companys material breach of its
obligations under this _Section 7.12(e)_.

 



 

(f) The Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Financing, _provided_ that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and subject to the prior review by, and
consent of, the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). In addition, the Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
supplement the written information (other than information of a general
economic or industry specific nature) concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries provided pursuant to this _Section 7.12_ to the extent that any
such information, to the knowledge of the Company contains any material
misstatements of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make
such information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, not misleading in any material respect promptly after gaining knowledge
thereof.

 



 

(g) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, as soon as
promptly as practicable after receipt of any written request by Parent to do
so, the Company shall:

 



 

(i) commence a consent solicitation to amend, eliminate or waive certain
sections of the Company Indenture as specified by Parent (a " _Consent
Solicitation_ "), with respect to all of the outstanding Company Notes on such
terms and conditions, including with respect to consent fees, that are
proposed by Parent; _provided_ that Parent shall consult with the Company and
afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to review the necessary consent
solicitation statement, supplemental indenture and other related documents in
connection with such Consent Solicitation (the " _Consent Solicitation
Documents_ "). The Company shall provide and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its respective Representatives to provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Consent Solicitation
including appointing a solicitation agent selected by Parent. The Company
shall waive any of the conditions to the Consent Solicitation as may be
reasonably requested by Parent (other than the condition that any proposed
amendments set forth therein shall not become operative unless and until the
Closing has occurred), so long as such waivers would not cause the Consent
Solicitation to violate applicable Law, and shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Consent Solicitation or
make any change, amendment or modification to the terms and conditions of any
Consent Solicitation other than as directed by Parent. Promptly following the
expiration of a Consent Solicitation, assuming the requisite consent from the
holders of the Company Notes (including from persons holding proxies from such
holders) has been received, the Company shall cause an appropriate
supplemental indenture (the " _Supplemental Indenture_ ") to become effective
providing for the amendments of the Company Indenture contemplated in the
Consent Solicitation Documents; _provided_ , however, that notwithstanding the
fact that a Supplemental Indenture may become effective earlier, the proposed
amendments set forth therein shall not become operative unless and until the
Effective Time has occurred. The form and substance of the Supplemental
Indenture shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) commence an offer to purchase, as specified by Parent, with respect to
all of the outstanding Company Notes, on such terms and conditions, including
pricing terms, that are proposed, from time to time, by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (" _Debt Tender Offer_ "), and Parent shall assist
the Company in connection therewith; _provided_ that Parent shall consult with
the Company and afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to review the
necessary offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal, supplemental
indenture and other related documents in connection with such Debt Tender
Offer (the " _Debt Tender Offer Documents_ ") and the material terms and
conditions of the Debt Tender Offer. The terms and conditions specified by
Parent for the Debt Tender Offer shall be in compliance with the Company
Indenture, the Senior Credit Facility or any applicable Law. The closing of a
Debt Tender Offer, if any, shall be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of
the Closing, and in accordance with the terms of the Debt Tender Offer, the
Company shall accept for purchase and purchase the Company Notes properly
tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Debt Tender Offer ( _provided_ that
the proposed amendments set forth in any Debt Tender Offer Document may not
become effective unless and until the Closing has occurred). The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to provide and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its respective Representatives to provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Tender Offer,
including appointing a dealer manager selected by Parent. The Debt Tender
Offer shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 promulgated under the
Exchange Act ("Rule 14e-1"), the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the
" _TIA_ "), if applicable, and any other applicable Law, it being understood
that the Company shall not be required to take any action that, in the good
faith judgment of the Company and after consultation with Company counsel,
does not comply with Rule 14e-1, the TIA, if applicable, or other applicable
Law. The Company shall waive any of the conditions to a Debt Tender Offer as
may be reasonably requested by Parent (other than the conditions that a Debt
Tender Offer is conditioned on the Effective Time occurring), so long as such
waivers would not cause a Debt Tender Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the
TIA or any other applicable Law, and shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, waive any condition to a Debt Tender Offer or make any
change, amendment or modification to the terms and conditions of a Debt Tender
Offer (including any extension thereof) other than as directed by Parent;
and/or

 



 

(iii) deliver a notice to each holder of the Company Notes, in accordance with
Section 3.9(b) of the Company Indenture, with respect to a Change of Control
Offer (as defined in the Company Indenture) for the repurchase, on and subject
to the occurrence of a Change of Control Payment Date (as defined in the
Company Indenture), to be mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, of all of
the Company Notes then outstanding and otherwise comply with the Company
Indenture with respect to such Change of Control Offer; and

 



 

(h) (x) deliver a notice of redemption pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Company
Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Company Indenture (including
Section 6 of the First Supplement thereto), which may be conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time; (y) cause the delivery, taking or making of
all required documents, actions or payments (other than the deposit of the
Company Notes Payoff Amount) under the Company Indenture to effect the (aa)
satisfaction and discharge of the Company Indenture pursuant to _Article
VIII_ thereof and

 



      
 

 



 

(bb) release of all obligations in respect of the Company Notes subject to the
payment of the Company Notes Payoff Amount; and (z) deliver to Parent a
schedule setting forth the Company Notes Payoff Amount.

 



 

Section 7.13 _Company Warrants_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Warrant shall be assumed
by Parent and the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the terms of the
Warrant Agreement, and each Company Warrant so assumed by Parent will continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such Company
Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such Company
Warrant shall cease to represent a warrant to purchase Class A Stock or Class
B Stock and will be converted into a warrant (the " _Parent Warrant_ ")
exercisable for the Merger Consideration which the Class A Stock or Class B
Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of the
Merger.

 



 

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time and in
accordance with the Warrant Agreement, (i) the Parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to deliver to Computershare Trust Company, N.A. the officers
certificate and opinion of counsel contemplated by Section 6.3 of the Warrant
Agreement and ( _ii_ ) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall execute and
deliver to the Company an assumption agreement as necessary to comply with
Section 6.3 of the Warrant Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.14 _Dividend Coordination_. After the date of this Agreement,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.1(b) or
Section 6.1(b), each of Parent and the Company shall coordinate with the other
with respect to the declaration of any dividend in respect of Parent Common
Stock and Parent Class B Stock or Company Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the Parties that the
holders of Company Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive
one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their Company Stock and any
Parent Common Stock that any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the
Merger.

ARTICLE IX

 



 

 _TERMINATION_

 



 

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time (except as otherwise stated below):

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

 



 

(i) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before May 8, 2018
(the " _Initial End Date_ "); _provided_ , that if on the Initial End Date any
of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not have been satisfied
but all other conditions set forth in Article VIII shall have been satisfied
or waived or shall then be capable of being satisfied, then the Initial End
Date shall be automatically extended to August 8, 2018 (the " _Second End
Date_ "). As used in this Agreement, the term "End Date" shall mean the
Initial End Date, unless extended pursuant to the foregoing sentence, in which
case, the term "End Date" shall mean the Second End Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
9.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to a Party if the failure of the Effective
Time to occur before the End Date was primarily due to such Partys breach of
any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) if there shall have been issued an Order by a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Merger
and such Order shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ that the
Party seeking to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_
shall have used its reasonable best efforts to have such Order lifted; or

 



 

(iii) if the Company Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournments or
postponements thereof) shall have concluded following the taking of a vote to
approve the Merger and the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained.

 



 

(c) by Parent:

 



 

(i) if ( _A_ ) a Triggering Company Event shall have occurred or ( _B_ ) the
Company has materially breached any of its obligations under _Section 7.2_ or
_Section 7.3_; or

 



 

(ii) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its ( _A_
) representations or warranties or ( _B_ ) covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, in each case which breach or failure to perform ( _x_ )
would give rise to the failure of a condition to the Merger set forth in
_Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ and ( _y_ ) is incapable of being cured
by the Company during the 30-day period after written notice from Parent of
such breach or failure to perform, or, if capable of being cured during such
30-day period, shall not have been cured by the earlier of the end of such
30-day period and the End Date; _provided_ that if such breach or failure to
perform is capable of being cured by the Company and the Company ceases using
reasonable best efforts to cure such breach or failure to perform following
written notice from Parent, Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then in breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements such that the Company
has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_.

 



 

(d) by the Company:

 



 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its ( _A_ ) representations or warranties or ( _B_ ) covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement, in each case which breach or failure to perform (
_x_ ) would give rise to the failure of a condition to

 



      
 

 



 

the Merger set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ and ( _y_ ) is
incapable of being cured by Parent and Merger Sub during the 30-day period
after written notice from the Company of such breach or failure to perform,
or, if capable of being cured during such 30-day period, shall not have been
cured by the earlier of the end of such 30-day period and the End Date;
_provided_ that if such breach or failure to perform is capable of being cured
by Parent and Merger Sub and Parent or Merger Sub cease using reasonable best
efforts to cure such breach or failure to perform following written notice
from the Company, the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)(i)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(d)(i)_ if the Company is then in breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements such that Parent has the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_; or

 



 

(ii) if ( _A_ ) the Company Board authorizes the Company to enter into an
Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Company
Proposal to the extent permitted by, and subject to the terms and conditions
of, _Section 7.3_, ( _B_ ) substantially concurrent with the termination of
this Agreement, the Company enters into an Alternative Company Acquisition
Agreement providing for a Superior Company Proposal and ( _C_ ) prior to or
concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to Parent in immediately
available funds the fee required to be paid pursuant to _Section 9.3_.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in _Section 9.1_,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating Party to
the other Party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made. In the event of the termination of this Agreement in
compliance with _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall be terminated and this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of any Party (or any stockholder,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such
Party), other than the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 9.2_,
_Section 9.3_, and _Article X_, which provisions shall survive such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section 10.12_, nothing in this _Section 9.2_ shall relieve any
Party from liability for Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination or the requirement to make the payments set forth in _Section
9.3_. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the
Parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Termination Fees; Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Company Termination Fee.

 



 

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(c)(i)_, or in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_, then, in each case, the Company
shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a fee in
the amount of $135,500,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") at or prior to
the termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ or as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within
two Business Days following such termination) in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(i)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_, or in the event
that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_
in respect of a Willful Breach by the Company of a covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, and in each case at any time after the date of
this Agreement prior to such termination ( _i_ ) a Company Acquisition
Proposal has been made to the Company and publicly announced and has not been
withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement (or prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section
9.1(b)(iii)_) and ( _ii_ ) within twelve months after such termination, the
Company ( _A_ ) enters into an agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition
Proposal and such Company Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated or
( _B_ ) consummates a Company Acquisition Proposal, then, in any such event,
the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the Company Termination Fee less the amount of any Parent Expenses
previously paid by the Company concurrently with the consummation of such
transaction arising from such Company Acquisition Proposal (and in any event,
within two Business Days following such consummation); _provided_ , _however_
, that for purposes of the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" in
this _Section 9.3(a)(ii)_, references to "15%" and "85%" shall be replaced by
"50%").

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, an amount equal to ( _A_ ) the documented out-
of-pocket costs and expenses, including the fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants, incurred by Parent
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 plus ( _B_ ) $38,500,000 (the
" _Parent Expenses_ ") as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within
two Business Days following such termination).

 



 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that ( _i_ ) the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, ( _ii_ ) the Company Termination Fee and Parent Expenses are not a
penalty, but are liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and ( _iii_ ) that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section 9.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company for any amount due
pursuant to this _Section 9.3_, then the Company shall pay Parent its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount due pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ from
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
annual rate of five percent plus the prime lending rate as published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made (or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law). All
payments under this _Section 9.3_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent or
the Company, as applicable. In no event shall a Company Termination Fee be
payable more than once.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to
_Section 10.12_ and other than in the case of Willful Breach or fraud, in the
event that this Agreement is terminated under circumstances where the Company
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this _Section 9.3_, the payment of the
Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates or Representatives (the " _Company Related Parties_ ")
for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount,
none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

ARTICLE X

 



 

 _Miscellaneous_

 



 

Section 10.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations, warranties covenants and agreements in this Agreement, or in
any schedule, certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, shall survive the Effective Time or, except as provided in
_Section 9.2_, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_,
as the case may be. This _Section 10.1_ shall not limit any covenant or
agreement of the Parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the
Effective Time.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in any and all respects by
written agreement of the Parties at any time prior to the Effective Time with
respect to any of the terms contained herein; _provided_ that after the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, no amendment that requires further
stockholder approval under applicable Law shall be made without such required
further approval. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_
or an amendment or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.2_
or _Section 10.3_ shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, action by their respective board of
directors (or a committee thereof), as applicable. Notwithstanding anything
set forth above, this _Section 10.2_, _Section 7.12_, _Section 10.8_,
_Section 10.11(b)_, _Section 10.12(c)_, _Section 10.13_ and _Section
10.14_ (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of any such Section, and any related definitions insofar as they
affect such Sections) shall not be amended, waived or otherwise modified in a
manner that is adverse to the interests of any Financing Source without the
prior written consent of such Financing Source.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, Parent or Merger Sub on the one hand, or the
Company on the other hand, may ( _a_ ) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, ( _b_ ) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement of the other Parties
or ( _c_ ) subject to the proviso of the first sentence of _Section 10.2_,
waive compliance by the other Parties with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument

 



      
 

 



 

in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any Party
of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further
exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that Parent shall act on behalf of Merger Sub and the
Company may rely on any notice given by Parent on behalf of Merger Sub with
respect to the matters set forth in this _Section 10.3_.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such cost or expense.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Disclosure Letter References_. All capitalized terms not defined
in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter (as applicable,
the " _Disclosure Letter_ ") shall have the meanings assigned to them in this
Agreement. The Disclosure Letter shall, for all purposes in this Agreement, be
arranged in numbered and lettered parts and subparts corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections and subsections contained in this Agreement.
Each item disclosed in the Disclosure Letter shall constitute an exception to
or, as applicable, disclosure for the purposes of, the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) to which it makes express reference
and shall also be deemed to be disclosed or set forth for the purposes of
every other part in the Disclosure Letter relating to the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) set forth in this Agreement to the
extent a cross-reference within the Disclosure Letter is expressly made to
such other part in the Disclosure Letter, as well as to the extent that the
relevance of such item as an exception to or, as applicable, disclosure for
purposes of, such other section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent from
the face of such disclosure. The listing of any matter on the Disclosure
Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company or
Parent, as applicable, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is
material, is required to be disclosed by the Company or Parent, as applicable,
under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or
materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in the
Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation by the Company
or Parent, as applicable, of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in the
Disclosure Letter be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, by facsimile
(with confirmation of transmission), by email (with confirmation of receipt)
or sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service, such as Federal
Express, to the Parties at the following addresses (or at such other address
for a Party as shall be specified by like notice made pursuant to this

Section 10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, it
being understood that each Party need not sign the same counterpart. This
Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties. Signatures delivered
electronically or by facsimile shall be deemed to be original signatures.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits hereto and the documents and the instruments referred
to herein), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and
the Confidentiality Agreement ( _a_ ) constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between Parent and the Company and among the Parties with respect to the

 



      
 

 



 

subject matter hereof and thereof; _provided_ that ( _x_ ) any provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement conflicting with this Agreement shall be
superseded by this Agreement and ( _y_ ) all standstill or similar provisions
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and no longer be in
effect upon execution and delivery hereof) and ( _b_ ) are not intended to and
do not confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon
any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns; _provided_ , further, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
following the Effective Time, the provisions of _Section 6.3_ shall be
enforceable by each Company Indemnified Party hereunder and his or her heirs
and his or her representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth above, the Financing Sources shall be a third party beneficiary of
_Section 7.12_, _Section 10.2_, this _Section 10.8_, _Section 10.11(b)_,
_Section 10.12(c)_ and _Section 10.13_ and _Section 10.14_.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as
a whole, are not affected in a manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties in
whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without such
consent shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Governing Law_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, or any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing, the Commitment Letter, the performance
thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) The rights and remedies of the Parties shall be cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur

 



      
 

 



 

and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event
