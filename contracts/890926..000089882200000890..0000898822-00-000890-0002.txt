Agreement         -ii-       AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER  
This is an Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") dated November 13,
2000, among ENHANCE FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. (the "Company"), a New York
corporation, RADIAN GROUP INC. ("Parent"), a Delaware corporation, and
GOLD Acquisition Corporation ("Sub"), a New York corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.   RECITALS   WHEREAS, the respective Boards
of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have approved the merger of Sub
with and into the Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the New York
Business Corporation Law (the "NYBCL"), whereby the issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (as defined herein), other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 1.6(b), will be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined herein);   WHEREAS, as an
inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain significant
shareholders of the Company are entering into an agreement with Parent (the
"Shareholders Support Agreement") pursuant to which each
significant shareholder has, among other things, agreed to vote such
significant shareholder\'s shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the
Merger;   WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the Merger, and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;
and   WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").      
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises hereinafter set forth
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:    ARTICLE
I   MERGER OF ACQUISITION AND THE COMPANY   1.1 THE MERGER. (a) Subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time
(as defined herein) pursuant to the Merger, Sub will be merged into the
Company, which will be the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"). Except as specifically provided in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, (i) the real and personal property, other assets,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes and franchises of the
Company will continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger, (ii) the
separate existence of Sub will terminate, and Sub\'s real and
personal property, other assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
purposes and franchises will be merged into the Surviving Corporation, and
(iii) the Merger will have the other effects specified in Section 906 of the
NYBCL.   (b) Notwithstanding Section 1.1(a), Parent may elect to modify the
structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, to provide for the merger of the Company
directly with and into Parent, so long as (i) there are no adverse tax or
other consequences to the holders of Company Common Stock as a result of such
modification, (ii) the consideration to be paid to the holders of Company
Common Stock under this Agreement is not thereby changed or reduced in form
or amount, and (iii) such modification will not materially delay or
jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory approvals or otherwise delay or
jeopardize the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event
that Parent determines to do the foregoing, the parties hereto agree to
modify this Agreement and any      -2-      exhibits, annexes or
schedules hereto to reflect such revised terms. In any such event, Parent
shall prepare appropriate amendments to this Agreement and any such exhibits,
annexes or schedules for execution by the parties hereto. The Company agrees
to cooperate fully with Parent to effect such amendments.   1.2 CERTIFICATE
OF INCORPORATION. From the Effective Time until subsequently amended, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Sub immediately before the Effective Time
will be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, except
that it will provide that the name of the Surviving Corporation will be
"Enhance Financial Services Group Inc.," and that Certificate of
Incorporation, separate and apart from this Agreement, may be certified as
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.   1.3 BY-
LAWS. From the Effective Time until subsequently amended, the By-Laws of Sub
immediately before the Effective Time will be the By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation.   1.4 DIRECTORS. The directors of Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation after
the Effective Time and will hold office in accordance with the By-Laws of
the Surviving Corporation.   1.5 OFFICERS. The officers of the Company
immediately before the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time and will hold office until successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable
law.   1.6 STOCK OF THE COMPANY. (a) Except as provided in Sections
1.6(b) and (c), at the Effective Time, each share of common stock of the
Company, par value $.10 per share, ("Company Common Stock"), that is
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will be converted into and
become the right to receive 0.22 (as adjusted pursuant to the immediately
succeeding sentence) (the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of common stock, par
value $.001 per      -3-      share, of Parent (such shares,
together with the associated rights (the "Parent Shareholder Rights")
pursuant to the Amended and Restated Shareholder Rights Agreement, dated as
of January 19, 1999, by and between CMAC Investment Corporation (predecessor
to Parent) and the Bank of New York, as Rights Agent thereunder, the "Parent
Common Stock"), together with any associated Parent Shareholder Rights. If
the Singer September 30 Net Worth (as defined herein) shall be less than $36
million, then the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced to equal 0.22 minus the
quotient (rounded to the nearest four decimal places) obtained by dividing
(1) the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the difference between $36 million
and the Singer September 30 Net Worth by (b) 38,500,000, by (2) the Starting
Price (as defined herein).    (b) Each share of Company Common Stock held
in the treasury of the Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company, immediately before the Effective Time will, at the
Effective Time, be cancelled and cease to exist, and no consideration will be
paid with respect to any of those shares of Company Common Stock.   (c) No
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued as a result of the
Merger. Any holder of Company Common Stock that, but for this Section 1.6,
would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock as
a result of the Merger will, at the Effective Time, have the right
to receive, instead of that fraction of a share and without interest, cash
equal to the Market Value of a share of Parent Common Stock on the Merger
Date (as defined herein) times the fraction. As used herein, the "Market
Value" of a share of Parent Common Stock on a day means the average of the
Last Sale Price of a share of Parent Common Stock on each of the twenty New
York Stock Exchange trading days ending on, and including, that day. As used
herein, the "Last Sale Price" of a share of Parent Common Stock on a
day      -4-      given will be the last sale price of a share of
Parent Common Stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange consolidated tape
prior to 4:00 p.m. New York City time on that day.   (d) The Parent Common
Stock into which a share of Company Common Stock is converted in the Merger
as provided in Section 1.6(a), together with the right to receive cash
instead of fractional shares, is referred to in this Agreement as the "Merger
Consideration."   1.7 STOCK OF SUB. At the Effective Time, each share of
stock of Sub ("Sub stock") which is outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time will be converted into and become one share of the same class
of stock of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, a certificate
which represented Sub stock will automatically become and be a certificate
representing the number of shares of the class of Surviving Corporation stock
into which the Sub stock represented by the certificate was converted.  
1.8 DISTRIBUTIONS WITH REGARD TO COMPANY STOCK. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent or Sub will designate a bank or trust company to act
as distributing agent in connection with the Merger (the "Distributing
Agent"). At, or immediately before, the Effective Time, Parent will provide
the Distributing Agent with the shares of Parent Common Stock and any funds
which will have to be distributed to holders of Company Common Stock under
Section 1.6(c) as a result of the Merger.   (b) After the Effective Time
and until they are distributed to former Company shareholders pursuant to
this Agreement, the shares of Parent Common Stock held by the Distributing
Agent will be deemed to be outstanding, but the Distributing Agent will not
vote those shares or exercise any rights of a shareholder of Parent with
regard to those shares of Parent Common Stock. If any dividends are paid with
regard to shares of Parent Common Stock while they are held by the
Distributing Agent, the Distributing Agent will hold the dividends,     
-5-      uninvested, until such shares of Parent Common Stock are
distributed to former holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement, at which time the dividends which have been paid with regard to
the shares of Parent Common Stock which are being distributed will be paid,
without interest, to the persons to whom the shares of Parent Common Stock
are being distributed.   (c) While the Distributing Agent is holding cash
provided by Parent under Section 1.8(a), the Distributing Agent will invest
the funds, as directed by Parent, in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of
America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by
Moody\'s Investors Services Inc. or Standard and Poors\' Rating Services, a
division of The McGraw-Hill Companies ("SandP;"), or in deposit accounts,
certificates of deposit or banker\'s acceptances of, commercial banks with
capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $200 million
(based on the most recent financial statements of the banks which are then
publicly available at the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or
otherwise).   (d) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will cause the Distributing Agent to mail to each person who was
a record holder of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time a form of
letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of stock
certificates representing Company Common Stock ("Certificates") in order to
receive the Merger Consideration. When the Distributing Agent receives a
Certificate, together with a properly completed and executed letter of
transmittal and any other required documents, the Distributing Agent will
distribute to the holder of the Certificate, or as otherwise directed in the
letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration with regard to the shares
represented by the      -6-      Certificate, and the Certificate
will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable
upon the surrender of a Certificate. If the Merger Consideration is to be
issued to a person other than the person in whose name a surrendered
Certificate is registered, the surrendered Certificate must be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person who
surrenders the Certificate must provide funds for payment of any transfer
or other Taxes (as defined herein) required by reason of the distribution to
a person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid. After
the Effective Time, a Certificate which has not been surrendered will
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (including any
dividends theretofore paid after the Effective Time with regard to shares of
Parent Common Stock included in the Merger Consideration), without any
interest.    (e) If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement in respect of the shares represented by the Certificate.   (f) At
any time which is more than six months after the Effective Time, Parent may
require the Distributing Agent to deliver to it any Parent Common Stock and
any funds which had been made available to the Distributing Agent and have
not been disbursed to former holders of Company Common Stock (including,
without limitation, interest and other income received by the Distributing
Agent in respect of the funds made available to it), and after the Parent
Common Stock and funds have been delivered to Parent, former shareholders of
the      -7-      Company must look to Parent for the Merger
Consideration. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Distributing
Agent will be liable to any former shareholder of the Company for any Merger
Consideration which is delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.    (g) After the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will not record any transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, and the stock ledger of the Company will be closed.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented for transfer, they
will be cancelled and treated as having been surrendered for the Merger
Consideration.   1.9 OPTIONS AND WARRANTS. At the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Options (as defined herein) which are then outstanding and
unexercised shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock and shall be converted into options to purchase shares of Parent
Common Stock on the same terms and conditions under the applicable Company
Stock Plan (as defined herein) and the stock option agreement by which such
Company Stock Option is evidenced. From and after the Effective Time, (a) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of such
Company Stock Option shall equal the product (rounded to the nearest share)
of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the
Exchange Ratio, and (b) the per share exercise price under each such Company
Stock Option shall be equal to the result (rounded to the nearest cent) of
dividing the per share exercise price of each such Company Stock Option by
the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Company Stock Option
that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422
of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section
424 of      -8-      the Code. As used herein, "Company Stock
Options" shall mean each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
under the stock-based compensation and incentive plans of the Company set
forth in Exhibit 1.9 (the "Company Stock Plans").   1.10 ADJUSTMENT OF
EXCHANGE RATIO. If, after the date of this Agreement, but prior to the
Effective Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding
shall, through a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change
(regardless of the method of effectuation of any of the foregoing, including
by way of a merger or otherwise) in the capitalization of Parent, increase or
decrease in number or be changed into or exchanged for a different kind or
number of securities, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall
be made to the Exchange Ratio.    ARTICLE II   EFFECTIVE TIME OF
MERGER   2.1 DATE OF THE MERGER. The day on which the Merger is to take
place (the "Merger Date") will be the third business day after the first day
on which all the conditions in Article V (other than conditions which are to
be fulfilled on the Merger Date) have been fulfilled or waived. The Merger
Date may be changed with the consent of the Company and Parent.   2.2
EXECUTION OF CERTIFICATE OF MERGER. Not later than 3:00 P.M. New York City
time on the day before the Merger Date, (a) Sub and the Company will each
execute a certificate of the merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
which complies with the requirements of Section 904 of the NYBCL, and deliver
it to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz for filing with the Department of State
of the State of New York on behalf of the parties. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and
Katz will be instructed that, if it is notified on the Merger Date that all
the conditions in Article V have been fulfilled or waived, it is to cause the
Certificate of Merger to be filed on behalf of the parties with     
-9-      the Department of State of the State of New York on the Merger
Date or as soon after that date as is practicable.   2.3 EFFECTIVE TIME OF
THE MERGER. The Merger will become effective at 11:59 P.M. Albany, New York
time on the day when the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Department
of State of the State of New York (that being the "Effective Time").

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by any document to be

cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.1(e)) or to a loss of any
benefit to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is entitled or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default) under, the Certificate of Incorporation or
By-Laws of the Company, any material agreement or material instrument to
which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which any
of them is bound or any Permit or other similar authorization affecting, or
relating in any way to, the assets or business of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, any law, or any order, rule or regulation of any

instrumentality or other regulatory organization (each, a "Governmental
Entity") having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or

transactions contemplated hereby.   (e) Each of the corporations and other
entities of which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of
the capital stock, partnership or membership interests or other equity, or
possesses the power, directly or indirectly, to elect a majority of the
members of the board of directors or other governing body of such corporation

party hereto being a "subsidiary" of that party hereto (PROVIDED, that for
all purposes of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise herein,
each of Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization LLC ("C-BASS") and
Sherman Financial Group LLC ("Sherman") shall be deemed to be subsidiaries of
the Company)) has been duly authorized, and is validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization,
and is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used herein,
"Material Adverse Effect" with respect to a party hereto means a material
adverse effect (i) on the business, properties, assets, liabilities
(including contingent liabilities), condition (financial or otherwise),
results of operations or prospects of such party and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (ii) on the ability of such party     
-12-      timely to perform its obligations under, or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that changes
or events set forth on Exhibit 3.1-E shall not constitute a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.   (f) The only authorized stock of the Company is
100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred
stock. As of the close of business on November 10, 2000, the only outstanding
stock of the Company was 38,223,467 shares of Company Common Stock. All the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and
issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. Except as shown on Exhibit
3.1-F, the Company has not issued any options, warrants or convertible or
exchangeable securities, and is not a party to any other agreements, which
require, or upon the passage of time, the payment of money or the occurrence
of any other event may require, the Company to issue or sell any of its
stock. Except as set forth in this Section 3.1(f) and except for changes

(i) shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company, (ii)
securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company

Company. Except as disclosed by the Company in Exhibit 3.1-G, neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries holds any interest in a partnership or
joint venture of any kind.   (h) Since January 1, 1997, the Company has
filed with the SEC all forms, statements, reports and documents it has been
required to file under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the
"Exchange Act") or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(collectively, the "Company Reports"). The Company Reports, including the
documents incorporated by reference in each of them, each contained all the
information required to be included in it and, when it was filed and as of
the date of such Company Report, did not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made in it, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading and complied as      -14-      to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act.   (i) (1) The Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 1999 (as amended by the Form 10-K/A filed on
September 20, 2000, the "Company 10-K") and its Report on Form 10-Q for the
period ended March 31, 2000 (as amended by the Form 10-Q/A filed on September
20, 2000, the "Company March 10-Q") and its Report on Form 10-Q for the
period ended June 30, 2000 (as amended by the Form 10-Q/A filed on September
20, 2000, the "Company June 10-Q") which the Company filed with the SEC,
including the documents incorporated by reference in each of them, each
contained all the information required to be included in it and, when it was
filed, did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in it,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and
complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act. Without limiting Section 3.1(h), the financial
statements included in the Company 10-K and the Company June 10-Q all were
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis (except to the extent that
unaudited interim financial information included in the Company Reports does
not contain notes and is subject to normal year end adjustments) and present
fairly the consolidated financial condition and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries at the dates,
and for the periods, to which they relate. Except as disclosed by the Company
on Exhibit 3.1-I(1), at the date of this Agreement, the Company has not filed
any reports with the SEC with regard to any period which ended, or any event
which occurred after June 30, 2000. The estimates of the Company\'s revenues
and net income for the quarter ended      -15-      September 30,
2000, which were disclosed by the Company to Parent as of the date hereof,
are substantially similar to the Company\'s actual revenues and net income
for the quarter ended September 30, 2000.   (2) The audited balance sheets
of the Company\'s insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999, and the
related statements of operations and statements of cash flows for the year
then ended, and their respective annual statements for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 1999 (the "Insurance Subsidiary Annual Statements") filed with
the insurance regulatory authorities in their respective jurisdictions of
domicile (collectively, the "Regulators"), copies of which have been
delivered to Parent, fairly present in all material respects their respective
statutory financial conditions as of such date and the results of their
respective operations and cash flows for the year then ended in conformity
with SAP. As used herein, "SAP" means the accounting procedures and practices
prescribed or permitted from time to time by the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners and adopted, permitted or promulgated by
the respective states of incorporation of the Company\'s insurance
subsidiaries and applied in a consistent manner throughout the periods
involved. The other information contained in the Insurance Subsidiary Annual
Statements fairly presents in all material respects the information required
to be contained therein in conformity with applicable requirements. The
balance sheets of the Company and its subsidiaries at dates after December
31, 1999, and the related statements of operations and statements of cash
flows, which have been filed with Regulators, copies of which have been
delivered to Parent, fairly present in all material respects the applicable
insurance subsidiaries\' respective statutory financial conditions as of such
dates and the results of their respective operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended in conformity with SAP consistently applied.     
-16-       (j) Except as disclosed by the Company in the Company June
10-Q or in Exhibit 3.1-J, since December 31, 1999, (i) the Company and
its subsidiaries (other than insignificant subsidiaries not involved in
the insurance business) have conducted their respective businesses only in
the ordinary course and a manner consistent with past practice and (ii)
nothing has occurred and there has been no development or state of
circumstances which, individually or in aggregate, has had or would be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (k)
The assets and properties owned, leased or licensed by the Company and its
subsidiaries constitute, in the aggregate, all the assets (including
Intellectual Property (as defined herein)) necessary to the conduct of their
businesses and operations as they currently are being conducted. All such
assets and properties (other than as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree) will be owned, leased or licensed by the Company and its
subsidiaries at the Effective Time and will as of the Effective Time permit
the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to conduct such businesses and
operations in substantially the same manner as such businesses and operations
have been conducted by the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time.   (l) The Company and its subsidiaries have at all times
complied, and currently are complying, with all, and none of them is under
investigation with respect to or has been threatened to be charged with or
given notice of any violation of any, applicable Federal, state, local and
foreign laws, regulations, rules, judgments, injunctions or decrees, except
failures to comply which would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.     
-17-       (m) (1) The Company and its subsidiaries have all
licenses, consents, authorizations, franchises, waivers, approvals,
certificates, filings and permits ("Permits") which are required to enable
them to own and conduct their businesses as they currently are being
conducted, and all such Permits are in full force and effect, except as would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company, no material violations exist in respect of any Permit of the
Company and its subsidiaries, and no proceeding or investigation is pending,
or to the best of the Company\'s knowledge threatened, that would be
reasonably likely to result in the suspension, revocation, limitation or
restriction of any Permit and, to the best of the Company\'s knowledge, there
is no reasonable basis for the assertion of any such material violation or
the institution of any such proceeding.   (2) All insurance policies issued
by any subsidiary of the Company which are now in force are, to the extent
required under applicable law, in a form acceptable to applicable regulatory
authorities, or have been filed with and not objected to by such authorities
within the period provided for such objection.   (3) The Company and each
subsidiary of the Company has filed all material reports, statements,
documents, registrations, filings or submissions required to be filed by the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company, respectively, with any applicable
Federal, state or local regulatory authorities, including to state insurance
regulatory authorities. All such material reports, statements, documents,
registrations, filings and submissions complied in all material respects with
applicable law in effect when filed and no material deficiencies have been
asserted by any such regulatory authority with respect to such reports,
statements, documents,      -18-      registrations, filings or
submissions that have not been satisfied. All premium rates, rating plans and
policy forms established or used by the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company that are required to be filed with or approved by insurance
regulatory authorities have been so filed or approved, the premiums charged
conform in all material respects to the premiums so filed or approved and
comply in all material respects with the insurance laws applicable
thereto, except where the failure to make such filing or obtain such approval
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (n) With the possible exception
of Tax Returns (as defined herein) of subsidiaries, which Tax Returns would
not be material, the Company and each of its subsidiaries has filed when due
(taking account of extensions) all Tax Returns which it has been required to
file and has paid all Taxes shown on such Tax Returns to be due. Such Tax
Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects. Such Tax Returns
accurately reflect all Taxes required to have been paid, except to the extent
of items which may be disputed by applicable taxing authorities but for which
there is substantial authority to support the position taken by the Company
or its subsidiary and which have been adequately reserved against in
accordance with GAAP on the consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2000
included in the Company June 10-Q. Except as shown on Exhibit 3.1-N, (i) no
extension of time given by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for
completion of the audit of any of its Tax Returns or for the assessment or
collection of any Tax has been requested or is in effect, (ii) there are no
tax liens against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
assets, except with respect to current Taxes not yet due, (iii) no Federal,
state, or local audits or other administrative proceedings or
court proceedings with regard to Taxes are presently pending or threatened in
writing with regard to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iv) neither
the Company nor any subsidiary of the      -19-      Company is a
party to or is bound by any agreement or arrangement providing for the
allocation or sharing of Taxes, (v) neither the Company nor any subsidiary of
the Company has participated in or cooperated with any international
boycott as that term is used in Section 999 of the Code, (vi) neither the
Company nor any subsidiary of the Company has filed a consent pursuant to
Section 341(f) of the Code or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code
apply to any disposition of a subsection (f) asset (as that term is defined
in Section 341(f)(4) of the Code) owned by the Company or any subsidiary of
the Company, (vii) no issues have been raised with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries by any taxing authority in connection with any audit or
examination of its Tax Returns, (viii) neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has any liability for the Taxes of any person (other than the
Company and subsidiaries of the Company that are members of the affiliated
group of corporations (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code) of
which the Company is the common parent) under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as
successor or transferee, by contract or otherwise, (ix) within the past five
years, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has been a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution
intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code and (x) the Company is
not aware of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Taxes" means
all taxes (including withholding taxes), assessments, levies and other like
governmental charges, and any related interest or penalties. As used herein,
"Tax Return" means any report, return or other information required to be
supplied to a taxing authority in connection with Taxes.     
-20-       (o) (i) The Company and its subsidiaries have all
material environmental Permits which are necessary to enable them to conduct
their businesses as they currently are being conducted without violating
any Environmental Law (as defined herein), which Permits are in full force
and effect, (ii) except as shown on Exhibit 3.1-O, neither the Company nor
any subsidiary has received any notice of material noncompliance or
material liability under any Environmental Law, (iii) the Company and its
subsidiaries are, and have been, in compliance in all material respects with
all Environmental Laws and (iv) neither the Company nor any subsidiary is
subject to any order of a Governmental Entity requiring the Company or any
subsidiary to take, or refrain from taking, any actions in order to comply
with any Environmental Law and no action or proceeding seeking such an order
or other action, claim, suit, proceeding, investigation or review related to
any Environmental Law is pending or, insofar as any officer of the Company is
aware, threatened against the Company. As used herein, "Environmental Law"
means any Federal, state, local or foreign law, rule, regulation, guideline
or other legally enforceable requirement of a Governmental Entity relating to
protection of the environment, to environmental conditions which affect human
health or safety or to pollutants, contaminants, wastes or chemicals or any
toxic, radioactive, ignitable, corrosive, reactive or otherwise hazardous
substances, wastes or materials.   (p) None of the software, databases,
computer firmware, computer hardware (whether general or special purpose), or
other similar or related items of automated, computerized, and/or software
system(s) that are used or relied on by the Company or by any of its
subsidiaries in the conduct of their respective businesses malfunctioned,
ceased to function, generated incorrect data, or provided incorrect results
when processing, providing and/or receiving date-related data with respect to
dates after December 31, 1999 due to the change from     
-21-      the twentieth to the twenty-first century, and the Company has
no reason to expect any such effects in the future.   (q) Except as shown
on Exhibit 3.1-Q, there are no contracts, agreements or other arrangements
which could result in the payment by the Company or by any subsidiary of an
"Excess Parachute Payment" as that term is used in Section 280G of the Code
as a result of the transactions which are the subject of this Agreement
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event).   (r) Except as shown
on Exhibit 3.1-R, there are no material liabilities of the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, and there is no
existing condition, situation or set of circumstances which could reasonably
be expected to result in such a liability, other than liabilities provided
for in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2000 as
set forth in the Company June 10-Q, contingent liabilities under insurance
policies in excess of the reserves required by GAAP, and liabilities incurred
since the date of such balance sheet in the ordinary course of business,
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; and liabilities or obligations
under this Agreement.   (s) (1) Except as disclosed by the Company on
Exhibit 3.1-S(1), neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party
to or bound by (i) any agreement any of the benefits or costs of which will
be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by
the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(ii) any agreement which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in
Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act) that has not been filed or      -22-      incorporated by
reference in the Company Reports; (iii) any agreement which would prohibit or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) any agreement relating to indebtedness
for borrowed money or any guarantee or similar agreement relating thereto,
other than any such agreement with, or relating to, an aggregate outstanding
principal amount or guaranteed obligation not exceeding $500,000 (other than
agreements entered into by the Company or its subsidiaries after the date
hereof in accordance with this Agreement in the ordinary course of
their businesses (including insurance, reinsurance and surety obligations
incurred by the Company\'s insurance subsidiaries)); (v) any material
license, franchise or similar agreement necessary for the operation of the
business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as it is
operated as of the date hereof; (vi) any agreement that restricts or
prohibits the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company from
competing with any person in any line of business or from competing in,
engaging in or entering into any line of business in any geographical area;
(vii) any ceded reinsurance agreement applicable to insurance in force
written by any subsidiary of the Company; (viii) any agreement containing
"change in control" or similar provisions relating to a change in control of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (ix) any "stop loss" agreement, other
than those entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice; (x) any agreement (other than insurance policies or other
similar agreements issued by any subsidiary of the Company in the ordinary
course of business) pursuant to which the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company is obligated to indemnify any other person; (xi) any agreement (other
than any option agreement under a Company Stock Plan) with any affiliate of
the Company (other than a subsidiary of the Company) or any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates;
(xii) any agreement relating to any joint venture or similar
arrangement;      -23-     (xiii) any other agreement that is, in
the Company\'s judgment, material to the business or operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (xiv) any guaranty of any
of the foregoing. As used in this Section 3.1(s), "agreement" means any
agreement, contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether
written or oral).   (2) The Company has heretofore furnished or made
available to Parent complete and correct copies (or, if oral, accurate
written summaries) of the items listed in Exhibit 3.1-S(1), each as amended
or modified to the date hereof, including any waivers with respect thereto
(the "Company Significant Agreements"). Except as specifically disclosed
therein: (i) each of the Company Significant Agreements is valid and binding
on the Company or its subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and
effect; (ii) the Company and each of its subsidiaries, as applicable, have in
all material respects performed all material obligations required to be
performed by them to date under each Company Significant Agreement; (iii)
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries knows of, or has received
notice of, any violation or default (or any condition which with the passage
of time or the giving of notice would cause such a violation of or a default)
by any party under any Company Significant Agreement, except in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii) above, such matters as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Set forth on Exhibit 3.1-S(2) is a description of any material
changes as of the date hereof to the amount and terms of the indebtedness of
the Company and its subsidiaries from that described in the financial
statement footnotes in the Company 10-K (or, as to C-BASS and Sherman, from
that shown on Exhibit 3.1-S(2)).   (3) All reinsurance and coinsurance
treaties or agreements, including retrocessional agreements, to which the
Company or any insurance subsidiary of the Company is     
-24-      a party or under which the Company or any such insurance
subsidiary has any existing rights, obligations or liabilities are in full
force and effect, except for such treaties or agreements as to which the
failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Except as disclosed by the Company on Exhibit 3.1-S(3)(A), neither
the Company nor any insurance subsidiary of the Company, nor, to the best of
the Company\'s knowledge, any other party to a reinsurance or coinsurance
treaty or agreement to which the Company or any insurance subsidiary of the
Company is a party, is in default in any material respect as to any provision
thereof, and no such agreement contains any provision providing that the
other party thereto may (whether with notice, lapse of time or both)
terminate such agreement solely by reason of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company has not received any notice to the effect that
the financial condition of any other party to any such agreement is impaired
with the result that a default thereunder may reasonably be anticipated,
whether or not such default may be cured by the operation of any offset
clause in such agreement. Except as disclosed by the Company on
Exhibit 3.1-S(3)(A), as of the date hereof, no insurer or reinsurer or group
of affiliated insurers or reinsurers accounted for the ceding to the Company
and the insurance subsidiaries of the Company, or the ceding by the Company
and the insurance subsidiaries of the Company, of insurance or reinsurance
business in an aggregate amount equal to five percent or more of the
consolidated gross premiums written by the Company and the insurance
subsidiaries of the Company for the year ended December 31, 1999. Except for
each of MBIA Inc. and its affiliates ("MBIA"), FGIC (as defined herein) and
Connie Lee Insurance Company, in each case as disclosed in Exhibit
3.1-S(3)(B), no ceding company has any rights under any circumstances
whatsoever (other than as a result of future downgrades in financial ratings)
to terminate on a      -25-      cut-off basis any reinsurance
contract it has entered into with an insurance subsidiary of the Company or
will obtain any such rights as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, PROVIDED that nothing in this sentence shall affect Parent\'s
rights under Section 6.1(i).    (t) Except as shown on Exhibit 3.1-T or for
any action, suit, investigation or proceeding that involves a claim under any
insurance, reinsurance or indemnity policy, fidelity bond, surety bond or
similar contract or undertaking issued or entered into by the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company, there is no action, suit, investigation or
proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of the Company threatened
against or affecting, the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or any of
their respective properties before any Governmental Entity which is
reasonably likely to result in damages individually in excess of $500,000 or
damages in the aggregate in excess of $1,000,000. There is no action, suit,
investigation or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of the
Company threatened against or affecting, the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company or any of their respective properties before any Governmental Entity
which would reasonably be expected to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially
delay the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the Company nor any
subsidiary of the Company nor any of their respective properties is subject
to any material order or judgment which would prevent or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   (u) (1) Each reserve
and other liability amount in respect of the insurance business, including,
without limitation, reserve and other liability amounts in respect of
insurance policies, established or reflected in the Insurance Subsidiary
Annual Statements was reviewed and certified by an independent actuary in
accordance with applicable state insurance laws and regulations. Each reserve
and other liability amount in respect of the insurance     
-26-       business, including, without limitation, reserve and other
liability amounts in respect of insurance policies, established or reflected
in any financial statements filed with Regulators with regard to dates or
periods after December 31, 1999 was reviewed by an independent actuary to the
extent required by applicable state insurance laws and regulations. Each
insurance subsidiary of the Company owns assets that qualify as admitted
assets under the insurance laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction of
domicile of such subsidiary in an amount equal to the sum of all the reserves
and liability amounts and the minimum statutory capital and surplus as
required by the insurance laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction of
domicile of such subsidiary. The reserves set forth in the Insurance
Subsidiary Annual Statements for the years indicated for payment of insurance
policy benefits, losses, claims and expenses were considered by management of
the Company to be adequate as of the date of such statements to cover the
total amount of all reasonably anticipated insurance liabilities of the
insurance company subsidiaries of the Company.   (2) Except as shown in
Exhibit 3.1-U(2), each of the insurance subsidiaries of the Company is
entitled to take full credit in its statutory financial statements pursuant
to applicable insurance laws for ceded reinsurance under all ceded
reinsurance agreements in effect on the date hereof to which any insurance
subsidiary is a ceding party and under which there is liability of either
party to the agreement (collectively the "Company Existing Reinsurance
Agreements"), and except as disclosed by the Company in Exhibit 3.1-U(2),
there is no claim under any Company Existing Reinsurance Agreement that is
disputed by any other party to such Company Existing
Reinsurance Agreement.   (v) Other than with respect to Credit2B.com Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("Credit2B") as shown on Exhibit 3.1-V or in the
ordinary course of its portfolio investment     
-27-      activities or loss mitigation activities, neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries has any contractual commitment to make any loan,
advance or capital contribution to, or investment in, any other person in
excess of $500,000 with respect to any individual person or $1,000,000 in the
aggregate.   (w) (1) Exhibit 3.1-W(1) includes a complete list of
each employee benefit plan, program, policy, practice, or other arrangement
providing benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any beneficiary or dependent
thereof that is sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries contributes
or is obligated to contribute, whether formal or informal, written or not
written, including, without limitation, any employee welfare benefit plan
within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), any employee pension benefit plan within
the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not such plan is subject to
ERISA) and any bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, vacation, stock
purchase, stock option, severance, employment, change in control or fringe
benefit plan, program or agreement under which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries provides or may be required to provide benefits to any current
or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any beneficiary or dependent thereof (each, an "Employee
Benefit Plan"). Except as disclosed by the Company on Exhibit 3.1-W(2),
neither the Company nor any subsidiary is a party to any agreement or
arrangement providing for annual future compensation of $500,000 or more with
any officer, consultant, director or employee.   (2) With respect to each
Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered or made available to Parent
a true, correct and complete copy of: (i) each writing     
-28-      constituting a part of such Employee Benefit Plan, including,
without limitation, all plan documents, employee communications, benefit
schedules, trust agreements, and insurance contracts, other funding vehicles
and any amendments thereto (including, without limitation, the Vice President
Agreement Amendments); (ii) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series)
and accompanying schedule, if any; (iii) the current summary plan description
and any material modifications thereto, if any (in each case, whether or
not required to be furnished under ERISA); (iv) the most recent annual
financial report, if any; (v) the most recent actuarial report, if any; and
(vi) the most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
(the "IRS"), if any, or the pending determination letter request submitted to
the IRS for the Qualified Plans listed on Exhibit 3.1-W(3). The Company has
also delivered or made available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy
of each handbook, manual or similar document, as currently in effect, which
is distributed by the Company or any subsidiary to its employees which lists
or describes the Employee Benefit Plans in which they are, or are entitled to
be, participants, which documents are consistent with the materials provided
or made available to Parent pursuant to the preceding sentence. Except as
specifically provided in the foregoing documents delivered or made available
to Parent, there are no amendments to any Employee Benefit Plan that have
been adopted or approved, nor has the Company or any of its subsidiaries
undertaken to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new
Employee Benefit Plan.   (3) Exhibit 3.1-W(3) identifies each Employee
Benefit Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a "Qualified Plan"). The IRS has issued, or
(in the case of Qualified Plans listed on Exhibit 3.1-W(3)) there is a
pending request for, a favorable determination letter with respect to each
Qualified Plan and the related trust that has not been revoked, and there are
no circumstances and      -29-      no events have occurred that
could adversely affect the qualified status of any Qualified Plan or the
related trust. No Employee Benefit Plan is intended to meet the requirements
of Code Section 501(c)(9).   (4) All contributions required to be made to
any Employee Benefit Plan by applicable law or regulation or by any plan
document or other contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable
with respect to insurance policies funding any Employee Benefit Plan, for any
period through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full or, to
the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof or to
the extent any Employee Benefit Plan is unfunded, have been fully reflected
on the financial statements included in the Company June 10-Q and/or the
financial statements of C-BASS and/or Sherman previously provided to Parent
or have been otherwise disclosed to Parent. Each Employee Benefit Plan that
is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA is either (i)
funded through an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit
fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) unfunded.   (5)
With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the Company and its subsidiaries
have complied, and are now in compliance, in all material respects, with all
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other laws and regulations applicable
to such Employee Benefit Plan and each Employee Benefit Plan has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms. There is
not now, nor do any circumstances exist that could give rise to, any
requirement for the posting of security or the imposition of any Lien on
the assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to an
Employee Benefit Plan under ERISA or the Code.      -30-       (6)
With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (i) there does not
exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of
the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) the fair market
value of the assets of such Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present
value of all accrued benefits under such Plan (whether or not vested); (iii)
no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which
the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement will not
result in the occurrence of any such reportable event; (iv) all premiums to
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") have been timely paid
in full; (v) no liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title
IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries; and (vi) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate such Employee Benefit Plan and, to the best of the Company\'s
knowledge, no condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings
will be instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of
ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer,
any such Plan.   (7) (i) Except as set forth in Exhibit 3.1-W(7), no
Employee Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a plan that has two or more
contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan");
(ii) none of the Company and its subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates (as defined herein) has, at any time during the last six
years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) none of the Company and its
subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability     
-31-      to a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial
withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I
of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA, that has not been satisfied in full.  
(8) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could
result in, any liability (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under section 302
of ERISA, (iii) under sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) as a result of
a failure to comply with the continuation coverage requirements of section
601 et seq. of ERISA and section 4980B of the Code, or (v)
under corresponding or similar provisions of foreign laws or regulations that
would be a liability of the Company or any of its subsidiaries following the
Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries, nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or
Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.   (9) Exhibit 3.1-W(9) sets forth (i) an
accurate and complete description of each provision of any Employee Benefit
Plan under which the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone or
in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated
vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries, or could limit the right of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from
any Employee Benefit Plan or related trust, (ii) the name of each
"disqualified individual" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code,
(iii) the name of each person who has a contractual right to receive
an excise tax gross-up and (iv) the maximum amount of the "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that could
become      -32-      payable by the Company and its subsidiaries
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event).   (10) None of the Company and its
subsidiaries nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in
any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the Employee Benefit Plans
or their related trusts, the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any person
that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify,
to any material Tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA.   (11) There are no pending or threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, and to the best of the
Company\'s knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably
give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against any of the Employee Benefit Plans,
or against any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Plans
or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Employee Benefit Plans,
which could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to the PBGC, the Department of Treasury,
the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Employee Benefit Plan or
a participant therein.   (12) The Company, its subsidiaries and each member
of their respective business enterprises have complied with the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and all similar state, local and
foreign laws (collectively, "WARN") and the financial statements of the
Company and each of its subsidiaries included in the Company Reports reflect
adequate accruals for all current and expected liabilities (including pay in
lieu of notice) under WARN.      -33-       (13) All Employee
Benefit Plans subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United
States (i) have been maintained in all material respects in accordance with
all applicable requirements, (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special
tax treatment, meet all requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they
are intended to be funded and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book-
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.  
(14) As used herein, "ERISA Affiliate" means, with respect to any entity,
trade or business, any other entity, trade or business that is a member of a
group described in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section
4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes the first entity, trade or business, or
that is a member of the same "controlled group" as the first entity, trade
or business pursuant to Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.   (x) The Company and
its subsidiaries own or otherwise have rights to use and, as of and from the
Effective Time, will own or otherwise have rights to use (in each case, free
and clear of any material Liens or other material limitations or
restrictions) all Intellectual Property used in their respective businesses
as currently conducted and as contemplated to be conducted; the use of any
Intellectual Property by the Company and its subsidiaries does not infringe
on or otherwise violate the rights of any person; and, to the best of the
Company\'s knowledge, no person is challenging, infringing on or
otherwise violating any right of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company
with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by and/or licensed to the
Company and its subsidiaries. From and after the Effective Time, the Company
and its subsidiaries will own or have valid and enforceable licenses or other
rights to use (in each case, free and clear of any material Liens or other
material limitations or restrictions) all Intellectual Property used in the
conduct of their respective businesses and     
-34-      operations as currently conducted in the same manner as such
Intellectual Property has been used to conduct such businesses and operations
prior to the date hereof. As used herein, "Intellectual Property" means
trademarks, service marks, brand names, certification marks, trade dress,
assumed names, trade names and other indications of origin, the goodwill
associated with the foregoing, and registrations in any jurisdiction of, and
applications in any jurisdiction to register, the foregoing, including any
extension, modification or renewal of any such registration or application;
inventions, discoveries and ideas, whether patentable or not in any
jurisdiction; patents, applications for patents (including divisions,
continuations, continuations in part and renewal applications), and any
renewals, extensions or reissues thereof, in any jurisdiction; nonpublic
information, trade secrets and confidential information and rights in any
jurisdiction to limit the use or disclosure thereof by any person; writings,
software, computer code and other works, whether copyrightable or not in any
jurisdiction; registrations or applications for registration of copyrights in
any jurisdiction, and any renewals or extensions thereof; and any similar
intellectual property or proprietary rights.   (y) To the best of the
Company\'s knowledge, there are no circumstances, and neither the Company nor
its subsidiaries nor, to the best of the Company\'s knowledge, any of its
other affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, that would prevent
the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.   (z) The Board of Directors of the Company has duly
approved the Merger and this Agreement, and such approval is sufficient to
render inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement the restrictions on "business combinations"
set forth in Section 912 of the NYBCL. No other "fair price", "moratorium",
"control share acquisition" or other similar antitakeover statute or
regulation enacted under state      -35-     or Federal laws in the
United States applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.  
(aa) Since December 31, 1999, except as shown on Exhibit 3.1-AA(1), there
have been no transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings between
the Company or its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company\'s
affiliates (other than affiliates that are now and were at such time wholly
owned subsidiaries of the Company) or other persons, on the other hand, that
would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Except with respect to Credit2B as
set forth in Exhibit 3.1-AA(2), the Company is not obligated, without its
consent, to make any loan, advance or capital contributions to or investments
in any person, including C-BASS, Sherman or Credit2B.   (bb) Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries is an "investment company" as defined
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries sponsors any person that is such an investment
company.   (cc) The Board of Directors of the Company has received
the opinion of Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated, financial advisor to the
Company, to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Exchange
Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to the Company\'s
shareholders.   (dd) (1) Each contract that is material to Singer\'s
business to which Singer (as defined herein) is a party (each, a "Singer
Material Contract" and collectively, the "Singer Material Contracts"),
including all contracts with respect to lottery, structured or viatical
settlements or securitizations related thereto, is a valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of Singer. There is no default under any Singer
Material Contract by Singer or, to the Company\'s knowledge, except as listed
on Exhibit 3.1-DD, by any other party thereto, and no event has     
-36-      occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice
or both would constitute a default thereunder by Singer, or, to the
Company\'s knowledge, any other party, which default or event, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. Except as listed on Exhibit 3.1-DD, as of the date
hereof, no party to any Singer Material Contract has given notice to the
Company or Singer or made a claim against the Company or Singer with respect
to any breach or default thereunder, which breach or default, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. Each Singer Material Contract, together with any
amendments thereto, has been disclosed to Parent, except as set forth on
Exhibit 3.1-DD. The enforceability of any Singer Material Contract shall not
be impaired by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and, as of the
date hereof, no Singer Material Contract requires that a transaction of the
kind contemplated by this Agreement receive the approval of any party to such
Singer Material Contract, except where such impairments or failures to
receive approvals, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (2) Each
Singer Material Contract is properly reflected on Singer\'s servicing system
as of the date hereof and the run-off model with respect to Singer (the
"Singer Run-Off Model") heretofore provided by the Company to Parent properly
reflects each Singer Material Contract, except to the extent that the failure
of any or all of the Singer Material Contracts which require servicing of
obligations to be properly reflected on Singer\'s servicing system as of the
date hereof and the failure of such Singer Run-Off Model to properly reflect
any or all of the Singer Material Contracts to which the Singer Run-Off Model
is relevant would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.      -37-       (ee) This Agreement
and each certificate or other instrument or document furnished by or on
behalf of the Company to Parent pursuant hereto does not and will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated herein or therein or necessary to make the statements
contained herein or therein, in light of circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.   3.2 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND

shareholders of Parent, have been taken. This Agreement has been duly
executed by each of Parent and Sub and is a valid and binding agreement of
each of Parent and Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Sub in

adopting this Agreement and approving the Merger.   (c) Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or of any document to be delivered
in accordance with this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or by any document to be delivered in
accordance with this Agreement will contravene, violate, result in a breach
of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default) under, the Certificate of Incorporation
or By-Laws of either Parent or Sub, any material agreement or material
instrument to which either Parent or Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent is
a party or by which any of them is bound, any law, or any order, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over Parent or any
of its subsidiaries, including Sub.   (d) Except for any need to file any
forms with or receive any Permits of insurance regulatory authorities, no
Permits of Governmental Entities, or other governmental action, other than
the expiration or termination of waiting periods under the HSR Act, if any,
and the Permits or actions contemplated by Section 3.1(d), are required to
permit each of Parent and Sub to fulfill all its obligations under this
Agreement.   (e) Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Sub has not, and at the
Effective Time will not have, engaged in any activities or incurred any
obligations or liabilities, except the activities relating to the

incurred in connection with those activities and with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.      -39-       (f) Parent and each
of its subsidiaries is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in
each state in which it is required to be qualified, except states in which
the failure to qualify, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect upon Parent.   (g) The only authorized stock of Parent is 100 million
shares of Parent Common Stock and 20 million shares of preferred stock, par
value $.001 per share. As of the close of business on November 10, 2000, the
only outstanding stock of Parent was 37,839,735 shares of Parent Common Stock
and 800,000 shares of $4.125 preferred stock, par value $.001 per share (the
"Parent Preferred Stock"). All the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
and Parent Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and issued and are fully
paid and non-assessable. Except as contemplated by this Agreement and except
for the Parent Shareholder Rights and not more than 6,500,000 options to
acquire Parent Common Stock, as of the close of business on November 10,
2000, Parent has not issued any options, warrants or convertible or
exchangeable securities, and is not a party to any other agreements, which
require, or upon the passage of time, the payment of money or the occurrence
of any other event may require, Parent to issue or sell any of its stock.  
(h) (i) Each of Parent\'s subsidiaries has been duly organized, and is
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state
of incorporation, (ii) all the shares of stock owned by Parent or a
subsidiary of Parent of each of Parent\'s subsidiaries are (to the extent
such concept is applicable) duly organized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable, are owned by Parent or a subsidiary of Parent free and clear
of any Liens and are not subject to any preemptive rights, and (iii) as of
the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has issued any
options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities, or is a party to
any other agreements, which require, or upon the passage of time, the payment
of money or the occurrence      -40-      of any other event may
require, Parent or any subsidiary to issue or sell any stock or other equity
interests in any of Parent\'s subsidiaries and there are no registration
covenants or transfer or voting restrictions with respect to outstanding
securities of any of Parent\'s subsidiaries.   (i) Since January 1, 1997,
Parent has filed with the SEC all forms, statements, reports and documents it
has been required to file under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the
rules under them (collectively, the "Parent Reports"). The Parent Reports,
including the documents incorporated by reference in each of them, each
contained all the information required to be included in it and, when it was
filed and as of the date of such Parent Report, did not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made in it, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading and complied as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act.   (j) (1) Parent\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 1999 (the "Parent 10-K") and its Report on Form 10-Q for
the period ended March 31, 2000 (the "Parent March 10-Q") and its Report on
Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2000 (the "Parent June 10-Q") which
Parent filed with the SEC, including the documents incorporated by reference
in each of them, each contained all the information required to be included
in it and, when it was filed, did not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made in it, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading and complied as to form in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.
Without limiting what is said in Section 3.2(i), the financial statements
included in the Parent 10-K and the Parent June 10-Q all were prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied      -41-      on a consistent basis
(except to the extent that unaudited interim financial information included
in the Parent Reports does not contain notes and is subject to normal year
end adjustments) and present fairly the consolidated financial condition and
the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Parent and its
subsidiaries at the dates, and for the periods, to which they relate. At the
date of this Agreement, Parent has not filed any reports with the SEC
with regard to any period which ended, or any event which occurred after,
June 30, 2000.   (2) The audited balance sheets of Parent\'s
insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999, and the related statements of
operations and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and their
respective annual statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 (the
"Parent Insurance Subsidiary Annual Statements") filed with the Regulators,
copies of which have been delivered to the Company, fairly present in all
material respects their respective statutory financial conditions as of such
date and the results of their respective operations and cash flows for the
year then ended in conformity with SAP. The other information contained in
the Parent Insurance Subsidiary Annual Statements fairly presents in all
material respects the information required to be contained therein in
conformity with applicable requirements. The balance sheets of Parent and its
subsidiaries at dates after December 31, 1999, and the related statements of
operations and statements of cash flows, which have been filed with
Regulators, copies of which have been delivered to the Company, fairly
present in all material respects the applicable insurance subsidiaries\'
respective statutory financial conditions as of such dates and the results of
their respective operations and cash flows for the periods then ended in
conformity with SAP consistently applied.   (k) Except as disclosed by
Parent in the Parent June 10-Q, since December 31, 1999, (i) Parent and its
subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in the     
-42-      ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice,
and (ii) nothing has occurred and there has been no development or state of
circumstances which, individually or in aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (l)
Parent and its subsidiaries have at all times complied, and currently are
complying, with all, and none of them is under investigation with respect to
or has been threatened to be charged with or given notice of any violation of
any, applicable Federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules,
judgments, injunctions or decrees, except failures to comply which would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.   (m) (1) Parent and its subsidiaries have all
Permits which are required to enable them to conduct their businesses as they
currently are being conducted, and all such Permits are in full force and
effect, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, no material violations exist in respect of any
Permit of Parent and its subsidiaries, and no proceeding or investigation is
pending, or to the best of Parent\'s knowledge threatened, that would be
reasonably likely to result in the suspension, revocation, limitation or
restriction of any Permit and, to the best of Parent\'s knowledge, there is
no reasonable basis for the assertion of any such material violation or the
institution of any such proceeding.   (2) Parent and each subsidiary of
Parent has filed all material reports, statements, documents, registrations,
filings or submissions required to be filed by Parent or any subsidiary of
Parent, respectively, with any applicable Federal, state or local regulatory
authorities, including to state insurance regulatory authorities. All such
material reports,      -43-      statements, documents,
registrations, filings and submissions complied in all material respects with
applicable law in effect when filed and no material deficiencies have been
asserted by any such regulatory authority with respect to such reports,
statements, documents, registrations, filings or submissions that have not
been satisfied. All premium rates, rating plans and policy forms established
or used by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent that are required to be filed
with or approved by insurance regulatory authorities have been so filed or
approved, and the premiums charged conform in all material respects to
the premiums so filed or approved and comply in all material respects with
the insurance laws applicable thereto, except where the failure to make such
filing or obtain such approval would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (n)
Parent and each of its subsidiaries has filed when due (taking account of
extensions) all Tax Returns which it has been required to file and has paid
all Taxes shown on those returns to be due. Such Tax Returns accurately
reflect all Taxes required to have been paid, except to the extent of items
which may be disputed by applicable taxing authorities but for which there is
substantial authority to support the position taken by Parent or
its subsidiary and which have been adequately reserved against in accordance
with GAAP on the consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2000 included in the
Parent June 10-Q.   (o) To the best of Parent\'s knowledge, there are
no circumstances, and neither Parent nor its subsidiaries nor, to the best
of Parent\'s knowledge, any of its other affiliates has taken or agreed to
take any action, that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   3.3
TERMINATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and
warranties in Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 7.1 will terminate at the Effective Time,
and none of the      -44-      Company, Parent or Sub will have any
rights or claims as a result of any of those representations or warranties

Company after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company will use
all reasonable best efforts to obtain the approval of its shareholders
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

Company may only withdraw, modify or change its recommendation to the
shareholders of the Company in connection with an Acquisition Proposal (as
defined herein) if that Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (as
defined herein).   (h) The Company\'s Board of Directors will not take any

voting upon the Merger, and Parent\'s Board of Directors will not take any

OF OFFERS; NOTICE OF PROPOSALS FROM OTHERS. (a) The Company will not, and
will not permit any of its subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees,
agents or representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or

by providing information) any discussion, negotiation or inquiry or the
making of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction
involving the Company, or a purchase of, or tender offer for, all or any
significant portion of the Company\'s equity securities or assets of the
Company or any of its insurance subsidiaries on a consolidated basis other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each of these being an
"Acquisition Proposal"). The Company immediately shall cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any persons
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal.   (b) Section 4.6(a) will not prevent the
Company from, in response to an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal
which the Company receives despite complying with Section 4.6(a) and which
the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith (x) after
consultation with its independent financial advisor, would result (if
consummated in accordance with its terms) in a transaction (i) for which
financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the Company and (ii)
would be more favorable over the long term to the Company\'s shareholders
than the Merger after taking into account the strategic benefits anticipated
to be derived from the Merger      -56-      and the prospects of
Parent and the Company as a combined company and (y) based upon the written
advice of outside counsel that there would be a reasonable probability that
the failure to do so would be held to be a breach of the fiduciary duties of
the Company\'s Board of Directors under applicable law (a "Superior
Proposal"), furnishing non-public information (after receipt of
an appropriate confidentiality agreement that is no less favorable to the
Company than the Confidentiality Agreement referred to in Section 9.2 hereof
between Parent and the Company) to the person, entity or group (the
"Potential Acquiror") which makes the Acquisition Proposal and entering into
discussions and negotiations with that Potential Acquiror.   (c) If the
Company or any officer, agent or representative thereof receives or is
contacted with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or the Company learns that
any person is contemplating soliciting tenders of Common Stock or otherwise
proposes to acquire the Company or a significant portion of its equity
securities or all or a significant portion of its and its subsidiaries\'
assets if the Company\'s shareholders do not approve the Merger, the Company
will promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent of that fact
and provide Parent with all information in the Company\'s
possession regarding the Acquisition Proposal, solicitation of tenders or
other proposed transaction, and the Company will promptly (but in any event
within 24 hours), from time to time, provide Parent with any additional
material information the Company obtains regarding the Acquisition Proposal,
solicitation of tenders or other proposed transaction.   4.7 APPROPRIATE
ACTION; CONSENTS. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,

to obtain any third party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) required
to prevent the occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or
Parent as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event that either party shall fail to obtain any third party consent
described in this Section 4.7(b), such party shall use reasonable best
efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other
party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent,
their respective subsidiaries and their respective businesses resulting, or
which could reasonably be expected to result after the Effective Time, from
the absence of such consent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such efforts and actions
shall not affect the conditions set forth in Article V.   4.8 COOPERATION.
Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other (i) with respect to
the timing of the respective shareholder meetings contemplated by Sections
4.5(f) and 4.5(g) and shall use their reasonable best efforts to hold such
meetings on the same day, (ii) in      -58-      connection with
the preparation of the Registration Statement and the joint proxy statement
to be included therein, (iii) in determining whether any action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, or
any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from
parties to any material contracts, in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) in seeking any
such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the

best efforts to obtain a written agreement from each person who is identified
as a person who may be deemed to be a Rule 145 Affiliate in the letter
referred to above as soon as practicable and, in any event, prior to the date
of the Company shareholder meeting, substantially in the form of Exhibit
4.9-A.   (b) Each of the parties hereto shall use its best efforts to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to qualify, and shall
not knowingly take any action, except for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, that could prevent such transactions from qualifying as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   4.10
TAKEOVER STATUTES. If any takeover statute is or may become applicable to the
Merger, each of Parent and the Company shall, to the extent they have the
power to do so, take      -59-      such actions as are necessary
so that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize any adverse
effects of any takeover statute on the Merger.   4.11 CERTAIN CONTRACTS. (a)

benefits in favor of Singer or any affiliate of Singer that could be
terminated or reduced) as a result of this Agreement or the
transactions      -60-      contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, shall have agreed in writing, pursuant to a form of consent in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, to waive such provision.

6.1(e) because the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement
shall have failed to receive the requisite vote for approval at the meeting
of Parent\'s shareholders held in connection with this Agreement or (iv) if
the Company terminates this Agreement under Section 6.1(h), then the Company
will have the option, exercisable by a notice given to Parent within 5
business days after the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement, to
require Parent to purchase (directly or through one or more wholly owned
subsidiaries) the 45.6% interest in C-BASS owned by Enhance Residuals, L.P.

Agreement), on customary terms to be mutually agreed, with the closing to be
held on the 30th day after the option is exercised or as soon thereafter as

parties and the Company shall cooperate with Parent to ensure that any such
rights are honored.      -61-       4.13 BENEFITS. The Company

provide that no such employee has a right or claim for receipt of such tax
reimbursement payment, and (2) to reflect the prior agreement of each of

which each is a party to expires on December 31, 2000.   4.14 SUPPORT

shall not have occurred on or before June 30, 2001; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 6.1(d) shall not be
available to the party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Effective Time to occur on or before such date.   (e) By Parent or the
Company if this Agreement shall fail to receive the requisite vote for
adoption or approval at the meeting of the Company\'s shareholders or the
meeting of Parent\'s shareholders held in connection with this Agreement,
including any adjournment or postponement thereof.   (f) By Parent, if (i)
the Board of Directors of the Company withdraws, modifies or changes its
recommendation of this Agreement in any manner adverse to Parent or shall
have resolved to do so, (ii) after receiving a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have refused promptly
(but in any case within 10 business days) to affirm its recommendation of
this Agreement, (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
recommended to the shareholders of the Company an Acquisition Proposal or
shall      -68-      have resolved to do so, or (iv) a tender or
exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company is commenced, and the Board of Directors of the Company fails to
recommend against, or states that it is taking no position with respect to,
acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the Company\'s
shareholders.   (g) By the Company at any time during the two business-day
period commencing two days after the Determination Date (as defined herein),
if both of the following conditions are satisfied:   (1) the Average
Closing Price (as defined herein) shall be  less than $51.35; and   (2) (i)
the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing  Price by the Starting
Price (such number, the "Parent Ratio") shall be  less than (ii) the number
obtained by dividing the Index Price (as defined  herein) on the
Determination Date by the Index Price on the Starting Date  (as defined
herein) and subtracting 0.15 from such quotient (such number,  the "Index
Ratio");  subject to the following three sentences. If the Company elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, it shall give prompt written notice to Parent; provided that such
notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the
aforementioned two-day period. During the two business-day period commencing
with its receipt of such notice, Parent shall have the option of adjusting
the Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser of (i) the number equal to the
quotient (rounded to the nearest one-ten-thousandth), the numerator of which
is the product of 0.80, the Starting Price and the Exchange Ratio (as then in
effect) and the denominator of which is the Average Closing Price, and (ii)
the number equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest one-ten-thousandth),
the numerator of which is the Index      -69-      Ratio multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and the denominator of which is the
Parent Ratio. If Parent makes an election contemplated by the preceding
sentence, within such two business-day period, it shall give written notice
to the Company of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 6.1(g) and
this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as
the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified), and any references in
this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to
the Exchange Ratio as adjusted pursuant to this Section 6.1(g). For purposes
of this Section 6.1(g), the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:   "Average Closing Price" means the average of the last reported
sale prices per share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the New York
Stock Exchange consolidated tape (as reported in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL or,
if not reported therein, in another mutually agreed upon authoritative
source) for the 20 consecutive trading days on the New York Stock Exchange
ending at the close of trading on the Determination Date.   "Determination
Date" means the business day prior to the date of the special meeting of the
Company\'s shareholders.   "Index Group" means the group of each of the 20
insurance companies listed below, the common stock of all of which shall be
publicly traded and as to which there shall not have been, since the Starting
Date and before the Determination Date, an announcement of a proposal for
such company to be acquired or for such company to acquire another company or
companies in transactions with a value exceeding 25% of the acquiror\'s
market capitalization as of the Starting Date. In the event that the common
stock of any such company ceases to be publicly traded or any such
announcement is made with respect to any such company, such company will
be      -70-      removed from the Index Group, and the weights
redistributed proportionately for purposes of determining the Index Price.
The 20 insurance companies and the weights attributed to them are as
follows:   COMPANY WEIGHTING ------- ---------  American International
Group, Inc. 5% Fannie Mae 5% Freddie Mac 5% Allstate Corporation
5% Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. 5% Chubb Corporation 5% St. Paul
Companies, Inc. 5% XL Capital Ltd 5% Ace Limited 5% CNA Financial

Inc. 5%   ------  100%    "Index Price" on a given date means the
weighted average (weighted in accordance with the factors listed above) of
the closing prices of the companies comprising the Index Group.   "Starting
Date" means November 13, 2000.   "Starting Price" shall mean $64.19, which
was the last reported sale price per share of Parent Common Stock on the
Starting Date, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange consolidated tape
(as reported in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL or, if not reported therein, in
another mutually agreed upon authoritative source).     
-71-      If any company belonging to the Index Group or Parent declares
or effects a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the Starting
Date and the Determination Date, the prices for the common stock of such
company or Parent shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of
applying this Section 6.1(g).   (h) By the Company if the Board of
Directors of Parent withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation of this
Agreement in any manner adverse to the Company or shall have resolved to do
so.   (i) By Parent, if Asset Guaranty Insurance Co. shall be
(1) downgraded, (2) placed on credit watch or (3) placed on credit review
with negative implications by SandP.;   6.2 MANNER OF TERMINATING AGREEMENT.

terminate this Agreement, it can terminate this Agreement by a written notice
to the other of them that it is terminating this Agreement.   6.3 EFFECT OF

Market Street Philadelphia, PA 19103 Ladies and Gentlemen:   The
undersigned, a holder of shares of common stock, par value $.10 per share
("Enhance Common Stock"), of Enhance Financial Services Group Inc., a
New York corporation ("Enhance"), is entitled to receive in connection with
the merger (the "Merger") of GOLD Acquisition Corporation ("Sub"), a New
York corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Radian Group Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Radian"), with and into Enhance, securities of Radian
(the "Radian Securities"). The undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned
may be deemed an "affiliate" of Enhance as the term affiliate is defined
under Rule 144, and interpreted for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Rule 145 ("Rule 145") of the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act").   If in fact the undersigned were an
affiliate under the Securities Act, the undersigned\'s ability to sell,
assign or transfer the Radian Securities received by the undersigned in
exchange for any shares of Enhance Common Stock in connection with the Merger
may be restricted unless such transaction is registered under the Securities
Act or an exemption from such registration is available. The undersigned
understands that such exemptions are limited and has discussed with its
counsel or counsel for Enhance the nature and condition of such exemptions to
the extent it believed necessary. The undersigned understands that neither
Radian nor Enhance will be required to maintain the effectiveness of any
registration statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of resale of
Radian Securities by the undersigned.   The undersigned hereby represents to
and covenants with Radian that the undersigned will not, directly or
indirectly, sell, assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any of the Radian
Securities issued to the undersigned in exchange for shares of Enhance Common
Stock in connection with the Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the
volume and other limitations of Rule 145 or (iii) in a transaction which, in
the opinion of the general counsel of Radian or other counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Radian or as described in a "no-action" or interpretive
letter from the Staff of the SEC specifically issued with respect to a
transaction to be engaged in by the undersigned, is not required to
be registered under the Securities Act.   In the event of a sale or other
disposition by the undersigned of Radian Securities pursuant to Rule 145, the
undersigned will supply Radian with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in
the form of a letter in the form of Annex I hereto. The undersigned
understands that Radian may instruct its transfer agent to withhold the
transfer of any Radian Securities owned by      the undersigned, but
that upon receipt of such evidence of compliance or the availability of an
exemption from registration under the Securities Act, the transfer agent
shall effectuate the transfer of Radian Securities sold as indicated in the
letter.   The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the legend set forth
below may be placed on certificates representing Radian Securities received
by the undersigned in connection with the Merger or held by a transferee
thereof, which legend may be removed by delivery of substitute certificates
upon receipt of an opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Radian from independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to Radian to the
effect that such legend is no longer required for purposes of the Securities
Act.   There may be placed on the certificates for Radian Securities issued
to the undersigned, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance:    "The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a
transaction  to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies.  The shares have not been acquired by the holder with a view to, or
for  resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning
of  the Securities Act of 1933. The shares may not be sold, pledged or 
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the 
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."   The undersigned
acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read this letter and
understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed upon the
distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of Radian Securities and
(ii) the receipt by Radian of this letter is an inducement to
Radian\'s obligations to consummate the Merger.       If you are in
agreement with the foregoing, please so indicate by signing below and
returning a copy of this letter to the undersigned, at which time this letter
shall become a binding agreement between us.    Very truly yours,

Securities were acquired by the undersigned in connection with the merger of
GOLD Acquisition Corporation, a New York corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Radian, with and into Enhance Financial Services Group

4.14-A    THIS AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of ____________,
2000, is by and among Radian Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Acquiror") and ____________________ (the "Shareholder").   WHEREAS,
concurrently herewith, Enhance Financial Services Group Inc., a New York
corporation (the "Company"), the Acquiror and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Acquiror are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the same
may be amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"; capitalized terms
used without definition herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in
the Merger Agreement);   WHEREAS, Shareholder is the beneficial owner of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock set forth in Schedule I hereto
(the "Subject Shares");   WHEREAS, approval of the Merger Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company is a condition to the consummation of the Merger;
and   WHEREAS, as a condition to its entering into the Merger
Agreement, the Acquiror has required that Shareholder agree, and Shareholder
has agreed, to enter into this Agreement;   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration
of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein,
the parties hereto agree as follows:   Section 1. Agreement to Vote. (a)
Shareholder hereby agrees to  ----------------- attend the meeting of
stockholders of the Company to be called and held for the purpose of
obtaining the approval of the Stockholders of the Company of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger (the "Company Meeting"), in person or by proxy, and
to vote (or cause to be voted) all Subject Shares, and any other
voting securities of the Company that Shareholder owns or has the right to
vote (whether such ownership or right exists as of the date hereof or is
obtained thereafter), (i) for approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement
and the Merger and (ii) against any proposals relating to an acquisition of
control of the Company by, or any other business combination of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries with, any person or entity other than the Acquiror
or its affiliates. Such agreement to vote shall apply also to any adjournment
or adjournments of the Company Meeting, and to any other meeting of
shareholders or action by written consent at which any item of business
referred to in the preceding sentence is presented for approval.      
(b) Shareholder hereby agrees that at all times prior to and including the
date of the Company Meeting, Shareholder shall continue to own and have the
right to vote the number and kind of Subject Shares listed in Schedule I
hereto.   (c) To the extent inconsistent with the foregoing provisions of
this Section 1, Shareholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies with
respect to Shareholder\'s Subject Shares or any other voting securities of
the Company.   Section 2. No Solicitation. Shareholder shall not, directly
or  --------------- indirectly, solicit or encourage (including by way of
furnishing information), or take any other action to facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal which constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company
or any insurance subsidiary of the Company. Shareholder shall promptly (and
in any event, within 24 hours of becoming aware of an inquiry or proposal)
advise the Acquiror orally and in writing of any such inquiries or proposals
of which Shareholder becomes aware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action
by a Shareholder who is a director or officer of the Company at the time of
such action, to the extent taken in such capacity and in compliance with
Section 4.6 of the Merger Agreement, shall be deemed to violate this Section
2.   Section 3. Securities Act Covenants and Representations. 
-------------------------------------------- Shareholder hereby agrees and
represents to the Acquiror as follows:   (a) Shareholder has been advised
that the offering, sale and delivery of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger will be registered under the Securities Act on the Registration
Statement. Shareholder has also been advised, however, that to the extent
Shareholder is considered an "affiliate" of the Company at the time the
Merger Agreement is submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company,
any public offering or sale by Shareholder of any Parent Common Stock
received by Shareholder in the Merger will, under current law, require either
(i) the further registration under the Securities Act of any shares of Parent
