or affiliate of either in any respect that would, in the reasonable good
faith judgment of Parent, be reasonably likely to (1) give rise to a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, (2) materially impair the benefits or advantages it
expects to receive from the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby,
or (3) give rise to a material adverse effect on the business plan or
business strategy of the combined company. Subject in all respects to the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall take any and all action
necessary, including (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding
separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of
assets or businesses of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii)
terminating any venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring
of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case,
to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or
file appropriate applications with any Antitrust Authority in connection with
any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets by
consenting to such action by the Company and provided that any such action
may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of
the Merger) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ ") to ensure that no Governmental
Entity enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction
(preliminary or permanent), or establishes any law, rule, regulation or other
action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger (" _Antitrust Prohibition_ ") or to ensure that no
Antitrust Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise
approve the consummation of the Merger, fails to do so by the Termination
Date. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall use its Reasonable
Efforts to assist Parent in resisting and reducing any Divestiture Action.
Parent and Company shall take reasonable efforts to share information
protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to
this section so as to preserve any applicable privilege. 

  

 (c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub and any of their respective Affiliates shall not take any action with the intention to or that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or any necessary approval of any Antitrust Authority under an HSR, Foreign Competition Notifications or Antitrust Law or the expiration of the required waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may take any reasonable action to resist or reduce the scope of a Divestiture Action, even if it delays such expiration to a date not beyond the Termination Date. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Affiliate_ " of any specified Person means any other Person directly or indirectly Controlling or Controlled by or under direct or indirect common Control with such specified Person. For purposes of this definition, " _Control_ ," when used with respect to any specified Person, means the power to direct the management and policies of such Person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms " _Controlling_ " and " _Controlled_ " have meanings correlative to the foregoing. 

  

 (d) If any Divestiture Action agreed to by Parent requires action by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, Parent hereby agrees to consent to the taking of such action by the Company or its Subsidiaries and any such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger.

Neither Parent nor the Company will issue any press release or any publication to the general public of any nature with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby that names any Closing Date Principal Shareholder except with the prior written consent of such Closing Date Principal Shareholder (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 Section 6.9 _Disclosure Schedules_. From time to time up to the earlier of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to supplement or amend the Schedules that they have delivered with respect to any matter first existing or occurring following the date hereof that (i) if it had existed or occurred at or prior to the date hereof, would have been required to be set forth or described in the Schedules on the date hereof or (ii) is necessary to correct any information in the Schedules that has been rendered inaccurate thereby. Any such supplement or amendment to the Schedules pursuant to the preceding sentence shall modify the representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ or  _Article IV_ for purposes of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.2(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that no supplement or amendment shall be given effect for such purposes to the extent it seeks to supplement or amend (i) the representations and warranties provided in _Section 4.8_ and _Section 4.24_, (ii) the representations and warranties relating to title to the Vessels provided in _Section 4.6_, or (iii) any representation in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ to disclose any information which would constitute or result in, or be reasonably likely to constitute or result in, a Material Adverse Effect. Any such supplement or amendment shall have no effect for purposes of determining whether a breach of the representations and warranties for purposes of _Section 9.1_ has occurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, supplements or amendments to the Schedules arising after the date of this Agreement from actions permitted under _Section 6.1_ shall not by themselves be deemed (i) to cause any condition to Closing in _Section 7.2(a)_ to fail to be satisfied or (ii) to constitute a breach of a representation or warranty for purposes of _Section 9.1(a)_ or an acknowledgement or admission that any such 

   ##### 

  

    

breach has occurred or that any such disclosure is material. For the
avoidance of doubt, no amendment or supplement of Schedule 9.3 shall be
permitted. 

  

 Section 6.10 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Tax Returns_. The Company shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Date Tax Returns_ ") and shall pay any Tax shown to be due and owing thereon. Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all other Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall make, or cause the Company (or applicable Subsidiary) to make, any payments shown to be due and owing thereon. Tax Returns required to be prepared by Parent for taxable periods beginning before the Closing Date shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for prior taxable periods unless a different treatment of any item is required by Applicable Laws. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including extensions thereof) of each Tax Return for a Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Shareholder Representative a copy of such Tax Return for review and comment, and Parents inclusion in any such Tax Return of any modification requested by the Shareholder Representative shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any such request for modification shall be made in writing by the Shareholder Representative within ten (10) days of receipt of the relevant Tax Return. Parent shall provide a copy of all final Tax Returns that cover any Taxable period beginning prior to the Closing Date to the Shareholder Representative promptly after filing. Any dispute between the Parties with respect to any matter addressed in this _Section 6.10(a)_ shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 9.3(c)_. 

  

 (b) _Tax Audits_. Parent, the Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries and the Shareholder Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns (a " _Tax Contest_ "). Such cooperation shall include the retention, and (upon the other partys request) the provision, of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Contest and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder; _provided, however,_ the party requesting assistance shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the party providing such assistance; _provided_ , _further_ , no party shall be required to provide assistance at times or in amounts that would interfere unreasonably with the business and operations of such party. The rights and responsibilities of the parties with respect to a Tax Contest shall be governed by the provisions of _Section 9.3_; _provided_ that in the case of any Tax Contest (or portion thereof) that could give rise to a Claim under _Section 9.3_, the Shareholder Representative shall have the right to confer with Parent with respect to, and to participate in the defense of, such Tax Contest (or portion thereof) from its commencement, subject to the right of the Shareholder Representative, at any time during the course of the Tax Contest, to assume or take control of the defense of such Tax Contest (or portion thereof) pursuant to  _Section 9.3(a)_. 

  

 (c) _Post Closing Tax Actions_. Except in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice or as otherwise provided in _Section 6.10(a)_ or _Section 6.10(b)_ , and subject to the next sentence of this _Section 6.10(c_), Parent shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of its Affiliates to, (i) make or change any Tax election, (ii) amend any Tax Return, or (iii) take 

   ##### 

  

    

any action or omit to take any action (all items in (i), (ii), and (iii),
collectively, " _Post-Closing Tax Actions_ "), including with respect to any
Tax Return for any period beginning prior to the Closing Date, that results
in any increased Tax liability of the Closing Date Principal Shareholders (or
their beneficial owners) or that would increase the indemnification
obligations of any Closing Date Principal Shareholders under Article IX,
except where (i) such Post Closing Tax Action is part of the final
determination of a Tax Contest with respect to such Tax Return (in which case
the taking of such Post Closing Tax Action shall nonetheless be subject to
_Section 6.10(b)_) or (ii) Parent has received the written consent of the
Shareholder Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if and to the extent that a Post-Closing Tax Action results in
any increased Tax liability of the Closing Date Principal Shareholders (or
their beneficial owners) but would not have resulted in any such increased
tax liability but for an inaccuracy in a representation in  _Section
4.14(a)(xv)_, Parent shall be treated as having complied with the first
sentence of this _Section 6.10(c)_. 

  

 (d) _PFIC Matters_. Parent and the Surviving Company shall provide (or cause to be provided) to the Shareholder Representative such information with respect to the taxable years of its Subsidiaries that include the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Taxable Years_ ," or, separately, a " _Closing Date Taxable Year_ ") as is necessary for the Shareholder Representative to make the designation referenced in the second sentence of this paragraph, including the most recent financial statements for Bully 1 Joint Venture and Bully 2 Joint Venture, within 90 days after the end of each Closing Date Taxable Year. No later than 30 days after the receipt of such information for a Subsidiary, the Shareholder Representative shall advise Parent whether or not it designates such Subsidiary as a "passive foreign investment company," within the meaning of section 1297 of the Code, for the Closing Date Taxable Year of such Subsidiary. Within 30 days after notification by the Shareholder Representative that such a Subsidiary has been so designated, Parent shall provide the Closing Date Principal Shareholders with a "PFIC Annual Information Statement" in accordance with U.S. Treasury regulations section 1.1295-1 (g) for such Subsidiary and shall provide any other information reasonably requested by the Closing Date Principal Shareholders with respect to the Closing Date Taxable Year of such Subsidiary as the Closing Date Principal Shareholders may need to comply with reporting obligations with respect to the ownership of a passive foreign investment company. 

  

 (e) _Good Standing Certificates_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, a certificate, dated as of a recent date prior to the Closing Date, duly issued by the appropriate Governmental Authorities in its jurisdiction of organization and, in each other jurisdiction listed on _Schedule 6.10(e)_ for such entity, showing such entity to be in good standing and authorized to do business in its jurisdiction or organization and those other jurisdictions and, to the extent customarily included in such certificates and available on a prompt and timely basis, that all state franchise and income tax returns and taxes due by it in its jurisdiction of organization and those other jurisdictions for all periods prior to the Closing have been filed and paid. 

  

 (f) _Section 338 Elections_. Parent shall not make or cause to be made elections under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the acquisition or deemed acquisition of the Company or the eligible Subsidiaries of the Company. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) _Conversion of Drilling ASA_. Before Closing, the Company shall take any action reasonably requested by Parent to enable a post-closing conversion of Drilling ASA from a Norwegian public limited company (Allment Aksjeselskap) to a Norwegian limited company (Aksjeselskap);  _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that (i) the Company shall not be required to take any action that may reasonably result in the breach of any contract or agreement or that may otherwise reasonably have an adverse effect on its business or operations and (ii) nothing in this _Section 6.10(g)_ shall be interpreted or construed as a condition to the Closing. Parent shall (i) reimburse the Company and Drilling ASA for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Company and Drilling ASA in complying with the Companys obligations under this  _Section 6.10(g)_ and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Closing Date Principal Shareholders for any loss or liability resulting from any actions undertaken pursuant to this  _Section 6.10(g_). 

  

 Section 6.11 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) Parent agrees to, or to cause the Surviving Company or another Subsidiary of Parent to, employ or continue to employ all persons listed on _Schedule 6.11(a)_ (as such schedule may be updated by Parent prior to the Closing) and who are employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (each such person, a " _Continuing_   _Employee_ ") and who satisfy Parents normal hiring policies, for a period extending until the earlier of (i) the termination of such Continuing Employees employment with such entities (A) for cause or (B) in the event of a reduction in force due to a Vessel becoming idle or the completion of the construction of Bully 1 or Bully 2 or (ii) the first anniversary of the Closing Date, on such terms and conditions, including compensation and benefits as are applicable to similarly-situated employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries other than the Company and its Subsidiaries. As of the Closing Date, Parent or one of its Subsidiaries shall assume and honor all existing employment agreements with Continuing Employees, all bonus arrangements existing with Continuing Employees listed on _Schedule 6.11(a)_, and all collective bargaining agreements applicable to the Continuing Employees and in effect as of the Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any obligations assumed by a Subsidiary of the Parent will also be guaranteed by the Parent or another credit-worthy entity. 

  

 (b) Parent shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits, but excluding eligibility and benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan) for service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor service credit under its employee benefit plans) under each of the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, or its relevant Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, as applicable, in which such Continuing Employee becomes or may become a participant to the extent such service was credited under the plans, programs and policies of the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such service recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits. As of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company or relevant Subsidiary to, credit to Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any applicable Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan as of the Closing Date and such amounts are set forth on _Schedule 6.11(a)_. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or its relevant Subsidiary for the benefit of any Continuing Employees, Parent shall (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such 

   ##### 

  

    

plan but only to the extent such periods, requirement or limitations were
satisfied under the Company Benefit Plans by such Continuing Employee; and
(ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for
all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Employee
Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan for the plan year that includes the Closing Date
for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums
as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable plan maintained by Parent or its relevant
Subsidiary, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.
Effective as of the Closing Date, Parent or one of its Subsidiaries shall
assume all employment-related claims, liabilities and obligations with
respect to each of the Continuing Employees, whether known or unknown, and
any other claims, liabilities or obligations arising out of the employment of
or termination of employment of any of the Continuing Employees, in each
case, whether or not such claims, liabilities and/or obligations are related
to periods before, on or after the Closing Date. On and after the Closing
Date, Parent and its Affiliates shall retain and indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any and all claims,
liabilities or obligations assumed by Parent or its Affiliates pursuant to
this _Section 6.11_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation of Parent
and its Affiliates to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries from any claims, liabilities or obligations pursuant to this
sentence shall be inapplicable to the extent any Parent Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.1_. The Company shall be
responsible for compliance with the WARN Act with respect to any plant closing
or lay off which requires a WARN notice and that occurs with respect to
employees of the Company or any one of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
Date. Any termination of Employees by Parent on or after the Closing Date
which creates an obligation to issue a WARN notice will be solely
the responsibility of the Parent even if such notice should have been given
prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement (including this _Section 6.11(c)_) shall (i) amend, or be deemed to amend, any Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan, (ii) provide any Person not a party to this Agreement with any right, benefit or remedy (whether express or implied) with regard to any Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan or a right to enforce any provision of this Agreement, (iii) limit in any way the ability to amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan at any time, subject to Applicable Laws, or (iv) create any right to continued employment with Parent or any of its Affiliates, except as contemplated in _Section 6.11(a)_. 

  

 Section 6.12 _Notice of Other Party s Breach_. Parent will give prompt notice to the Company and the Shareholder Representative of any failure of the Company or any Closing Date Principal Shareholder to comply in any material respect with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any of them under this Agreement of which Parent has Knowledge. Company will give prompt notice to Parent of any failure of Parent or the Merger Sub to comply in any material respect with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any of them under this Agreement of which the Company has Knowledge.

 Section 6.13 _Release of Claims_. 

   

 (a) Upon the consummation of the Merger, each Party, on behalf of itself, its respective successors and assigns and any Person Controlled by such Party (each, a " _Releasing Party_ "), hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally releases, acquits and discharges each other Party and each such other Partys direct and indirect members, partners and other owners, Affiliates and Subsidiaries, and its and their respective officers, directors, representatives, attorneys, successors and assigns and any officers and members of the Company board of directors and any officers and members of each Subsidiary board of directors (and all other similar governing bodies) and their successors and assigns, each in its capacity as such (collectively, the " _Releasees_ "), with respect to and from any and all Claims (as defined below) that any other Releasing Party had or may have or claim to have in the future against each or any of the Releasees by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever relating in any manner whatsoever to (i) any Releasees equity and/or debt interests in or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries including matters arising under the Shareholders Agreement, the organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries and any agreements relating to the Outstanding Shares or Converting Interests, and any loan agreements, subscription agreements and other similar agreements with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the Recapitalization Agreement and (ii) any act, omission, misrepresentation, transaction, fact, event or other matter occurring prior to the Closing related to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or properties (the Claims released under clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the " _Released Claims_ "), and acknowledges and agrees that in the event any Claim is raised, or any Claim is threatened against the Releasees by any other Releasing Party or their equity owners, partners or Affiliates with respect to any cause, matter or thing which is the subject of the above, regardless of when any such Claim is raised, this Release may be raised as a complete bar to any such Claim, and the applicable Releasee may recover from the applicable Releasing Parties all costs incurred in connection with such Claim, including attorneys fees; _provided_ , _however,_ that the Released Claims shall exclude any and all rights of any Party under this Agreement (including the right to indemnification under _Article IX_, _Section 6.14_ or the rights specified under _Section 8.2_). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Released Claims shall not include any Claim arising out of the fraud or intentional misconduct of any Releasee.

For avoidance of doubt, from and after Closing, no Closing Date Principal Shareholder or any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to contribute any amount of money or make any loans to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (c) " _Claims_ " means any and all assertions, charges, claims, demands, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, causes of action, controversies, challenges, complaints, damages, remedies, suits, rights, costs, losses, debts, and expenses (including attorneys fees and costs) of any kind whatsoever, known or unknown, whether in law or equity and whether arising under federal, state, local or non-U.S. law, in each case arising from or relating to any acts, omissions or other conduct by any party that occurred on or prior to the Closing Date.

Such rights may be amended, or otherwise modified in any manner that does not adversely affect the rights of the Shareholder Indemnitees or as required by Applicable Law. 

  

 (b) In the event any Claim is asserted or made, any determination required to be made with respect to whether a Shareholder Indemnitees conduct complies with the standards set forth under Applicable Law, the applicable organizational documents of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries listed on _Schedule 6.14_, as the case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel.

 (e) Parent hereby agrees that, irrespective of whether Shareholder Indemnitee is employed by a Closing Date Principal Shareholder and therefore may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by a Closing Date Principal Shareholder or its Affiliates, the Surviving Company (or its applicable Affiliate) is the indemnitor of first resort with respect to rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses provided under the organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or under any other indemnification agreement or arrangement listed on _Schedule 6.14_ ( _i.e_., the Shareholder Indemnitees rights under the organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or

Company DandO Insurance), any amounts that would be otherwise payable
or indemnifiable under the organizational documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or under any other indemnification agreement or arrangement

 (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by such Closing Date Principal Shareholder in _Article III_ or in any Principal Shareholder Ancillary Document executed and delivered by such Closing Date Principal Shareholder other than the Recapitalization Agreement, whether such breach or inaccuracy exists or is made on the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , that for purposes of determining whether any representations and warranties have been breached or are inaccurate, all Material Adverse Effect qualifications and other materiality qualifications contained in such representations and warranties shall be disregarded; or

 (a) Promptly after receipt by a Parent Indemnified Party or a Shareholder Indemnified Party (hereinafter collectively referred to as an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice by a third party (including any Governmental Entity) of any Actions or the commencement of any audit with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment hereunder for any Parent Losses or any Shareholder Losses (as the case may be), such Indemnified Party will notify Parent or the Closing Date Principal Shareholders, as the case may be (in such capacity, Parent or the Closing Date Principal Shareholders are hereinafter referred to as an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), of such Action or audit (for purposes of this _Section 9.3_, references to "Action" shall include any such audit); _provided_ , _however,_ that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under this Agreement with respect to such Action only if, and only to the extent that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party results in the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of any rights or defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Action. Unless (i) the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such Action and the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that a conflict of interest exists that would make joint representation inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to defend such Action, the Indemnifying Party will have the right, at its sole expense, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within ten calendar days after receiving such notice of the Action, to assume and control the defense of such Action with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing to the Indemnified Party its unqualified obligation to fully indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article IX_. In the event, however, that the Indemnifying Party (A) declines or fails to (1) assume the defense of the Action on the terms provided above, (2) provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to defend such Action and provide indemnification with respect to such Action or (3) employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, in any case within such ten-day period, or (B) is also a party to such Action and the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that a conflict of interest exists that would make joint representation inappropriate, then such Indemnified Party may employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to represent or defend it in any such Action and the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel as incurred;  _provided_ , _however,_ that the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in any single Action. For avoidance of doubt, the fees and disbursements of counsel of any Parent 

   ##### 

  

    

Indemnified Party in connection with a Parent Loss shall be satisfied by
receiving from the Escrow Agent a portion of the Escrow Amount in an amount
equal to such fees. In any Action with respect to which indemnification is
being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party,
whichever is not assuming the defense of such Action, will have the right to
participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at such Partys own
expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be,
will at all times use Reasonable Efforts to keep the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of
the defense of any Action the defense of which they are maintaining and to
cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any
such Action. 

  

 (b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless (i) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume and maintain the defense of such claim pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ or (ii) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the Indemnifying Party from all liability arising out of such claim. An Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder unless (i) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, (ii) does not contain any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party and (iii) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term which in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates. 

  

 (c) A claim for indemnification by an Indemnified Party for any matter not involving an Action by a third party may be asserted by written notice to the Indemnifying Party from whom indemnification is sought. Such notice will specify with reasonable specificity the basis for such claim. As promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has given such notice, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party will establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, litigation, arbitration or otherwise) and, within ten (10) Business Days of the final determination of the merits and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying Party will pay to the Indemnified Party immediately available funds (or, if the Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnified Party, in accordance with this _Article IX_) in an amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder. 

  

 (d) An Indemnified Partys knowledge before the Closing of the breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty or of the failure to comply in any material respect with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this _Article IX_ shall not affect such Indemnified Partys right to indemnification under this _Article IX_, regardless of whether such Indemnified Party provides notice pursuant to _Section 6.12_ to the Indemnifying Party of such breach, inaccuracy or failure and regardless of the manner in which such Indemnified Party obtained such knowledge. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the indemnification procedures with respect to the matter disclosed on _Schedule 4.24(a)_ and any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(i), (ii) or (iii)_ that arises under or relates in 

   ##### 

  

    

any way to any failure of compliance prior to the Closing Date with the Anti-
Corruption Laws including the FCPA shall be governed by _Schedule 9.3_. 

  

 Section 9.4 _Claims Period_. 

  

 (a) With respect to any Parent Losses (other than Parent Losses relating to (A) any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties made by the Company in _Section 4.14_ or with respect to any Tax matter in _Section 4.8_ or _4.9_ or (B) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by the Company in _Section 6.10_ (the Parent Losses referenced in _Section 9.4(a)(A)_ and _(B)_ , " _Tax Related Parent Losses_ ")) or Shareholder Losses, the period during which a claim for indemnification may be asserted under this Agreement by an Indemnified Party shall begin on the Closing Date and terminate on the date that is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (the " _Primary Claims Period_ "). With respect to any Tax Related Parent Losses, the period during which a claim for indemnification may be asserted under this Agreement by an Indemnified Party shall begin on the Closing Date and terminate on the date that is thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date (the " _Tax Related Claims Period,_ " together with the Primary Claims Period, each, a " _Claims Period_ "). No claim may be asserted with respect to any Party after the Primary Claims Period has ended, other than Claims for Tax Related Parent Losses; and no Claim for Tax Related Parent Losses may be asserted with respect to any Party after the Tax Related Claims Period has ended; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Claims Period for, and the ability to assert any Claim related to, Parent Losses arising out of or resulting from any breach or inaccuracy of the representation and warranty made by any Closing Date Principal Shareholder in _Section 3.4_ shall not terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) all covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Company Ancillary Documents or the Principal Shareholder Ancillary Documents which by their terms contemplate actions or impose obligations following the Closing shall survive in accordance with their terms and (ii) all representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company Ancillary Documents or the Principal Shareholder Ancillary Documents shall survive for the applicable Claims Period. If, prior to the close of business on the last day of the applicable Claims Period, an Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof. 

  

 (b) Except with respect to a Tax Return on which an inconsistent position has been taken pursuant to _Section 6.10(a)_, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no claim for indemnification with respect to any Losses related to Taxes may be asserted prior to the time a Governmental Entity issues a notice of proposed adjustment (or similar assessment) in respect of such Losses. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Limits of Liability_. 

  

 (a) _Parent De Minimis Liabilities and Parent Basket_. Parent Indemnified Parties shall not assert a claim against the Closing Date Principal Shareholders for indemnification under  _Section 9.1_ for Parent Losses unless the amount of such Parent Loss exceeds $100,000 (aggregating for such purpose all Parent Losses relating to or resulting from the same circumstance or related claims) (those Parent Losses that do not exceed such $100,000 

   ##### 

  

    

threshold shall be referred to as the " _Parent De Minimis Liabilities_ ")
and then not until the aggregate amount of all Parent Losses, excluding the
Parent De Minimis Liabilities, incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties
exceeds $7,000,000 (the " _Parent Basket_ ") and then the recoverable Losses
shall be limited to those that exceed the Parent Basket. Notwithstanding the
preceding, the limitations on the indemnification obligations of the Closing
Date Principal Shareholders set forth in this _Section 9.5(a)_ shall not
apply to Parent Losses resulting from (A) fraud or intentional misconduct,
(B) any breach of the covenant of the Closing Date Principal Shareholders to
pay Company Transaction Costs to the extent required by _Section 2.8(a)_, (C)
any breach or inaccuracy of the representation and warranty made by such
Closing Date Principal Shareholder in  _Section 3.4_, (Sections 9.5(a)(A),
(B) and (C) collectively, the " _Excluded Claims_ "), any breach or
inaccuracy of the representation and warranty made by the Company in
_Section 4.16(k)_ , _Section 4.24_ or the matters disclosed on _Schedule
4.24(a)_. 

  

 (b) _Unknown FCPA Claim De Minimis Liabilities_. Parent Indemnified Parties shall not assert a claim against the Closing Date Principal Shareholders for indemnification under  _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ for Parent Losses relating to any breach or inaccuracy of the representation and warranty made by the Company in _Section 4.24_ unless the amount of such Parent Loss exceeds $250,000 (aggregating for such purpose all Parent Losses relating to or resulting from the same circumstance or related claims). 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no Party, and none of the entities that have committed to arrange or provide financings in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (such entities, the " _Financing Sources_ "), shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any Excluded Loss except to the extent that an Indemnified Party becomes obligated to pay such damages to a third party that is not an Affiliate of the Indemnified Party. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, (i) prior to the Closing, no Closing Date Principal Shareholder shall have any liability or obligation to any Parent Indemnified Party as a result of a breach by the Company of this Agreement, any Company Ancillary Document or any Principal Shareholder Ancillary Document and (ii) no Closing Date Principal Shareholder shall have any liability or obligation (before or after the Closing) to any Parent Indemnified Party as a result of any breach by any other Closing Date Principal Shareholder of this Agreement or any Principal Shareholder Ancillary Document, other than the obligations of the Closing Date Principal Shareholders set forth in this _Article IX_. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy; Recourse Against Escrowed Funds_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing, other than the remedies set forth in _Section 6.14_, the remedies set forth in this _Article IX_ and the specific performance remedy referenced in  _Section 8.2_ shall provide the sole and exclusive remedies arising out of, in connection with, relating to or arising under this Agreement, the Principal Shareholder Ancillary Documents, the Company Ancillary Documents or the Parent Ancillary Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other laws or otherwise, including any breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made herein or any other document contemplated herein or delivered pursuant hereto. 

   ##### 

  

    

In the event this Agreement is terminated without the occurrence of the
Closing, the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties shall be as set forth
in _Section 8.3_. Except in the case of fraud or intentional misconduct, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that the remedies available in this  _Section
9.6_ supersede (and each Party waives and releases) any other remedies
available at law or in equity including rights of rescission, rights of
contribution and claims arising under applicable statutes. 

  

 (b) Parent, on behalf of itself and all other Parent Indemnified Parties, further acknowledges and agrees that, after the Closing, the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be the sole and exclusive source of funds for satisfaction of all (and no Closing Date Principal Shareholder shall under any circumstance have any personal liability or obligation for the satisfaction of any) Claims by all Parent Indemnified Parties for any Losses or otherwise, including those set forth in  _Section 9.1_, in connection with, arising out of or resulting from the subject matter of this Agreement, the Principal Shareholder Ancillary Documents or the Company Ancillary Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for Parent Losses related to the Excluded Claims. 

  

 (c) Except for Parent Losses related to the Excluded Claims, from and after Closing, the aggregate liability of the Closing Date Principal Shareholders to any Parent Indemnified Parties in connection with this Agreement, the Principal Shareholder Ancillary Documents or the Company Ancillary Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall not exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount, which shall be available to satisfy Losses of Parent Indemnified Parties, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on their own behalf and on behalf of each other Parent Indemnified Party, hereby covenant forever not to assert, file, prosecute, commence, institute (or sponsor or purposely facilitate any Person in connection with the foregoing), any complaint or lawsuit or any legal, equitable, arbitral or administrative proceeding of any nature, against any of the Closing Date Principal Shareholders in connection with any claim for indemnification, except as otherwise permitted in _Section 8.2_ and except as to Parent Losses that relate to Excluded Claims. At and after such time as the Indemnification Escrow Amount is exhausted or released, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to seek indemnity under this Agreement or otherwise except indemnity for Parent Losses related to Excluded Claims, and the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no recourse against any Closing Date Principal Shareholder for any unpaid Losses of any Parent Indemnified Party except to the extent such Losses are related to Excluded Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no Closing Date Principal Shareholder shall have any liability to any Parent Indemnified Parties, to the extent that the aggregate Parent Losses for which such Closing Date Principal Shareholder has made payments pursuant to this _Article IX_ would exceed the portion of the Merger Consideration that such Closing Date Principal Shareholder received at the Closing, including for the avoidance of doubt, any portion of such Merger Consideration included in the Escrow Amount. 

  

 (d) Parent shall cause the Escrow Amount to be deposited on the Closing Date with the Escrow Agent to be held in trust pursuant to the terms hereof and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Each of the Severance Holdback Escrow Amount and the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be allocated to separate accounts maintained for each of the Junior Shareholders based on the number of Outstanding Shares set forth on _Annex III_ (which Annex 

   ##### 

  

    

shall be updated prior to the Closing so as to be accurate as of the Closing)
held by such Junior Shareholder on the Closing Date _multiplied by_ the Per
Share Escrow Amount appropriately allocated between the Severance Holdback
Escrow Amount and the Indemnification Escrow Amount. 

  

 (e) If a Parent Indemnified Party asserts an indemnity claim against the Closing Date Principal Shareholders for indemnification under _Section 9.1_ during the Primary Claims Period and the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification for such indemnity claim in accordance with this _Article IX_, the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to such indemnity payment solely by receiving from the Escrow Agent the Indemnification Escrow Amount in an amount equal to the amount of such indemnity claim except in the case of indemnity claims for Parent Losses related to Excluded Claims. If a Parent Indemnified Party asserts an indemnity claim against the Closing Date Principal Shareholders for indemnification with respect to any Tax Related Parent Loss during the period commencing on the first day after the Primary Claims Period and extending through the Tax Related Claims Period, and the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification by the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Article IX_, the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to such indemnity payment solely by receiving from the Escrow Agent all or a portion of the lesser of (i) the then-remaining balance of Tax Related Retained Escrow Amount, as defined below, or (ii) the amount of such indemnity claim for a Tax Related Parent Loss. 

  

 (f) To the extent any Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to a distribution from the Indemnification Escrow Amount or Tax Related Escrow Amount as a result of an indemnity claim under  _Section 9.1_, such distribution of the Indemnification Escrow Amount to the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be allocated to the interests of the Junior Shareholders pro rata based upon the Ownership Percentage of each Junior Shareholder. 

  

 (g) All claims asserted by a Parent Indemnified Party during the applicable Claims Period that are not resolved and satisfied (including the obligation to pay any such indemnity claim) prior to the end of the applicable Claims Period shall be deemed to be " _Pending Claims_." The dollar amount of all Losses claimed in good faith in respect of Pending Claims are hereinafter referred to as the " _Pending Claim Amount_." 

   

 (i) On the first Business Day following the last day of the Primary Claims Period (the " _Primary Escrow Release Date_ "), Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to release and deliver, to the SECP Participants and the Junior Shareholders in accordance with the amounts set forth in such instructions, the amount by which (x) the amount then held in the account maintained with respect to the Indemnification Escrow Amount by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement exceeds (y) the sum of the aggregate amount of all Pending Claim Amounts as of the Primary Escrow Release Date plus $15,000,000 (the " _Tax Related Retained Escrow Amount_ "). The remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount will continue to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) On the first Business Day following the last day of the Tax Related Claims Period (the " _Tax Related Retained Escrow Release Date_ "), Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to release and deliver, to the SECP Participants and the Junior Shareholders in accordance with the amounts set forth in such instructions, the amount by which (x) the remaining Escrow Amount exceeds (y) the sum of the aggregate amount of all Pending Claim Amounts as of the Tax Related Retained Escrow Release Date. The remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount will continue to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to be extended accordingly. 

  

 (h) The fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be borne 50% by the Closing Date Principal Shareholders pro rata (based on each Closing Date Principal Shareholders relative percentage ownership of the aggregate amount of Outstanding Shares held by the Closing Date Principal Shareholders at Closing, as set forth opposite such Closing Date Principal Shareholders name on Schedule 3.4) and 50% by Parent. 

  

 Section 9.7 _Compliance with Express Negligence Rule_. ALL RELEASES, LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY AND INDEMNITIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THOSE IN THIS _ARTICLE IX_ , ARE INTENDED TO BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND SCOPE THEREOF NOTWITHSTANDING ANY EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE OR ANY SIMILAR DIRECTIVE THAT WOULD PROHIBIT OR OTHERWISE LIMIT INDEMNITIES BECAUSE OF THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR OTHER FAULT OR STRICT LIABILITY OF ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES. 

  

 Section 9.8 _Insurance Proceeds_. The Parent Losses and Shareholder Losses giving rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds (less the costs expended by Parent, the Surviving Company or any other Subsidiary of Parent for such recoveries) or other payments actually received by the Indemnified Party in satisfaction of any Losses giving rise to the claim for indemnification, solely to the extent such insurance proceeds are attributable to insurance policies existing prior to the Closing Date and the costs of such insurance policies at the time of the occurrence of the event which gave rise to the applicable Loss were borne by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under any such insurance policies or under other rights of recovery for Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parents obligation in the preceding clause shall not affect any Parent Indemnified Partys right to provide notice of a claim for indemnification with respect to any Parent Loss under _Article IX_ or the amount retained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 9.6(g)_. 

  

 Section 9.9 _DISCLAIMER_. EXCEPT FOR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE IN THIS AGREEMENT, ANY COMPANY ANCILLARY DOCUMENT OR ANY PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER ANCILLARY DOCUMENT, EACH CLOSING DATE PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE EXPRESS OR

 Section 10.3 _Shareholder Representative_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Closing Date Principal Shareholders hereby irrevocably appoints Riverstone/Carlyle Global Energy and Power Fund IV (Cayman), L.P. (the " _Shareholder Representative_ ") as such Closing Date Principal Shareholders representative, attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of such Closing Date Principal Shareholder, to act for and on behalf of such Closing Date Principal Shareholder to take any and all actions and make any and all decisions which under this Agreement as to which the Shareholder Representative is expressly authorized to act or make, including the power: 

   

 (i) to take any and all action necessary or desirable in connection with the waiver of any condition to the obligations of the Closing Date Principal Shareholders to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

   

 (ii) to receive on behalf of the Closing Date Principal Shareholders notice of all indemnification claims by a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article IX_ and to notify all Closing Date Principal Shareholders of any such claim and to take all actions in connection with such indemnifications claims on behalf of the Closing Date Principal Shareholders as may be necessary or desirable; and 

   

 (iii) to give instructions to the Escrow Agent in connection with the release of the Indemnification Escrow Amount as contemplated by _Section 9.6(f)_. 

  

 Each of the Closing Date Principal Shareholders hereby consents to and confirms such appointment and the taking by the Shareholder Representative of any and all such acts and the making of any and all such decisions. Each of the Closing Date Principal Shareholders will be bound by any and all actions taken and any and all decisions made by the Shareholder Representative pursuant to the terms of this _Section 10.3_, and Parent and the Surviving Company will be entitled to rely on any such actions or decisions. 

  

 (b) The Shareholder Representative will not be liable for any act taken or omitted by it as permitted under this Agreement, except if taken or omitted in bad faith or by willful misconduct. The Shareholder Representative will also be fully protected in relying upon any written notice, demand, certificate or document that it in good faith believes to be genuine (including facsimiles thereof). 

    ##### 

 

   

 (c) The Closing Date Principal Shareholders agree, severally but not jointly, to indemnify the Shareholder Representative for, and to hold the Shareholder Representative harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Shareholder Representative, arising out of or in connection with the Shareholder Representatives carrying out its duties under this Agreement, including costs and expenses of successfully defending the Shareholder Representative against any claim of liability with respect thereto. To the extent the Shareholder Representative is entitled to any amount as a result of an indemnity claim under this _Section 10.3(c)_, such amount shall be paid by the Closing Date Principal Shareholders pro rata based on each Closing Date Principal Shareholders relative percentage ownership of the aggregate amount of Outstanding Shares held by the Closing Date Principal Shareholders at Closing, as set forth opposite such Closing Date Principal Shareholders name on Schedule 3.4. 

   

 (d) In the event the Shareholder Representative becomes unable or unwilling to continue to serve in the capacity of Shareholder Representative, he may resign and be discharged from his duties and obligations as Shareholder Representative by giving his resignation to each of the Parties, specifying a date not less than ten days following such notice date of when such resignation will take effect and, in that event, Riverstone/Carlyle Energy Partners IV, L.P. will be deemed to be appointed by the Closing Date Principal Shareholders as the new Shareholder Representative and shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, be the Shareholder Representative.
