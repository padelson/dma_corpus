AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 21, 2000 (this
"Agreement"), by and among M-Foods Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Holdings"), Protein Acquisition Corp., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Holdings ("Merger Sub"), and Michael Foods, Inc.,
a Minnesota corporation (the "Company").   W I T N E S S E T H :  
WHEREAS, Merger Sub and the Company have each determined that it is in their
respective best interests for Merger Sub to acquire the Company, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS,
the respective boards of directors of Holdings, Merger Sub and the Company
each have approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, with each share of the Company\'s common
stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Common Stock"), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time being
cancelled, extinguished and converted into and becoming a right to receive a
price per share equal to the Price Per Share, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, (1) certain
executives of the Company will enter into letter agreements with M-Foods
Investors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Investors"), pursuant
to which such persons agree to execute, immediately prior to the Closing,
certain agreements (the "Management Equity Agreements") which will provide
for, among other things, (a) the cancellation of a portion of their options
to purchase Company Common Stock as of the Effective Date in exchange for
rights under a deferred compensation arrangement with Holdings and (b) the
purchase of membership interests in Investors by such persons and (2) certain
beneficial and record shareholders of the Company will enter into letter
agreements with Investors pursuant to which such persons agree to execute,
immediately prior to the Closing, certain agreements (the "Other Equity
Agreements") which will provide that, among other things, such persons will
exchange shares of the Company Common Stock they hold for a price per share
equal to the Price Per Share and membership interests in Investors;  
WHEREAS, as soon as may be permitted after satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth herein, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company (the "Merger") in accordance with this Agreement and the relevant
provisions of the MBCA, and the surviving corporation of the Merger shall be
the Company; and   WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the
"Company Board"), subsequent to the unanimous recommendation of a special
committee of the Company Board (the "Special Committee"), has determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the shareholders of the
Company, has declared the Merger and this Agreement to be advisable and has
recommended approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company.     7  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto agree as follows:    ARTICLE 1  THE MERGER   1.1 THE
MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the
Effective Time. Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company, as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Holdings, shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation"). The Merger will be effected pursuant to the provisions of, and
with the effect provided in, the Minnesota Business Corporation Act
(the "MBCA").   1.2 CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place as soon as practicable, but no later than the fourth business
day, after satisfaction or waiver (as permitted by this Agreement and
applicable law) of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their terms,
cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date) set forth in Article 5 (the
"Closing Date"), unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis,
200 East Randolph Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601, unless another place is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.   1.3 EFFECTIVE DATE AND TIME.
Upon the Closing, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the
State of Minnesota appropriate articles of merger or other appropriate
documents (in any such case, the "Articles of Merger") executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the MBCA and shall make all other filings,
recordings or publications required under the MBCA in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time of such
filings or such other time after such filings as the parties hereto shall
agree to in the Articles of Merger (the "Effective Time"). The date on which
the Effective Time shall occur is referred to as the "Effective Date."  
1.4 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Surviving Corporation shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Minnesota. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers,
immunities and franchises of Merger Sub and the Company shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of
Merger Sub and the Company shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.5 SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS. If, at
any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider
or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any
other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either
of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to
carry out this    -2-  8 Agreement, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and to take, in the name and on behalf of
each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as
may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   1.6 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. Subject to Section
4.7(a), at the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company
(as amended and restated in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A
hereto) shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation,
until thereafter amended as provided by the MBCA and the provisions of such
articles of incorporation.   1.7 BYLAWS. At the Effective Time, the bylaws
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by the MBCA, the provisions of the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.   1.8 OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF
SURVIVING CORPORATION. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the officers of
the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or otherwise ceasing to be an officer. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the
Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier
of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.   1.9 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. As
of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of any shares of the Company Common Stock or any shares of
capital stock of Merger Sub:   (a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share
of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock; Merger Sub-
Owned Stock. Each share of the Company Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by Merger Sub
or by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, shall be cancelled, extinguished and retired, and no payment of any
consideration shall be made with respect thereto.   (c) Company Common
Stock. Each share of the Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 1.9(b) and any Dissenting Shares) will, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into the right to receive $30.10 in cash per share of Company
Common Stock without any interest thereon (the "Price Per Share"),    
-3-  9 subject to appropriate adjustment for any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring before the
Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of the Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a stock
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of the Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the
surrender of such Certificates as provided in Section 1.11, the Price Per
Share in cash.   1.10 OPTIONS. Except as may be otherwise agreed in
writing between the Company and any holder of any Option (as hereinafter
defined), upon the consummation of the Merger, each option to acquire Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
Company\'s 1994 Executive Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Executive
Incentive Plan"), the Company\'s 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, the
Company\'s 1994 Executive Performance Stock Award Plan, as amended (the
"Executive Performance Plan"), the Company\'s 1987 Non-Qualified Stock Option
Plan, as amended and the Company\'s Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee
Directors, as amended (such plans referred to herein as the "Option Plans"),
whether vested or unvested (each, an "Option," collectively, the "Options"),
shall automatically become immediately vested and exercisable and each holder
of an Option shall have the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation a
cash payment (less applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes) in
an aggregate amount equal to the difference, if any, between the Price Per
Share less the applicable exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
applicable to such Option for all Company Common Stock subject to the Option
as expressly stated in the applicable Option Plan, stock option agreement or
other agreement. Options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the
Price Per Share will be cancelled without any consideration. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts (including, without limitation, giving
requisite notices to holders of Options advising them of such accelerated
vesting and rights pursuant to this Section 1.10) to fully advise holders of
Options of their rights under this Agreement and the Options, to facilitate
their timely exercise of such rights and to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 1.10. From and after the Effective Time, other than as expressly set
forth in this Section 1.10, no holder of an Option shall have any
other rights in respect thereof other than to receive payment for his or her
Options as set forth in this Section 1.10, and the Company shall take all
necessary actions to terminate effective as of the Effective Time the
Company\'s Option Plans, stock option agreements and similar
arrangements.   1.11 SURRENDER AND PAYMENT.   (a) Paying Agent. Before the
Effective Time, Holdings shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the record holders of shares of
the Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent").
At or before the Effective Time, Holdings will deposit, or cause Merger Sub
to deposit, as applicable, in trust for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates with the Paying Agent immediately available funds (the "Funds")
in an amount necessary to make the payments for the shares of the Company
Common Stock contemplated by this Agreement on a timely basis. The Paying
Agent will be authorized, at the request of Holdings, to invest any Funds
held by it in (i) investment grade money market instruments, (ii) direct
obligations of the United States of America, (iii) obligations for which
the    -4-  10 full faith and credit of the United States of America is
pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iv) commercial
paper rated the highest quality by either Moody\'s Investors Services, Inc.
or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation or (v) certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers\' acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion, in each case having maturities not to exceed
30 days and as designated by Holdings, with any interest earned thereon being
paid to Holdings at the earlier of (A) payment in full of the aggregate Price
Per Share to all record holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger and (B) 180 days after the Effective Time;
provided that no loss on investments made pursuant to this Section 1.11(a)
shall relieve Holdings of its obligations to pay the Price Per Share to all
record holders of Company Common Stock as provided in Article 1 of this
Agreement.   (b) Surrender of Certificates. Promptly (and in any event
not later than five (5) business days) after the Effective Time, Holdings and
the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail and/or make
available to each record holder of Certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of the Company Common Stock (other than
holders of Certificates representing Dissenting Shares or representing shares
covered by Section 1.9(b)), a notice and letter of transmittal and
instructions in standard form for use in effecting the surrender of all
Certificates held by such record holder.   (c) Payment Procedures. Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed and completed, the Paying Agent shall pay to the
holder of such Certificate the aggregate Price Per Share attributable to the
number of shares of the Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate,
and such Certificate will then be cancelled. Until surrendered in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 1.11, each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares and Certificates representing
shares covered by Section 1.9(b)) will represent for all purposes only the
right to receive the aggregate Price Per Share relating thereto. No interest
shall accrue or be paid in respect of cash payable upon the surrender of
Certificates. After the Effective Time, holders of Certificates shall cease
to have any rights as shareholders of the Company, except as provided herein
or under applicable state corporation law. If any payment of cash in respect
of cancelled shares of the Company Common Stock is to be paid to a Person
other than the registered holder of the shares represented by the Certificate
or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to
such payment that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer
or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than
the registered holder of such shares or establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Any consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to all
applicable federal, state and local Tax withholding requirements. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Tax" (including, with correlative meaning, the
terms "Taxes" and "Taxable") means all federal, state, local and foreign
income, profits, franchise, gross receipts, environmental, customs duty,
capital stock, severance, stamp, payroll, sales, transfer, employment,
unemployment disability, use, property, withholding, excise, production,
value added, occupancy and other taxes, duties or assessments of any nature
whatsoever, together with all interest, penalties, fines and additions to tax
imposed with respect to such amounts and any interest in respect of such
penalties and additions to tax. For purposes of this Agreement, "Person"
means an individual, corporation, partnership, limited     -5- 
11 liability company association, trust, unincorporated organization, entity
or group (as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act")).   (d) No Transfer. After the Effective Time, there
will be no transfers of shares of the Company Common Stock recorded on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason they will be cancelled and exchanged for the Price
Per Share as provided in Section 1.13(a) below.   1.12 LOST CERTIFICATES.
If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Price Per Share
due to such Person as provided in Section 1.13(a) of this Agreement.   1.13
UNCLAIMED MERGER CONSIDERATION.   (a) Transfer to Surviving Corporation. Any
portion of the Funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section
1.11(a) that remain unclaimed by holders of Certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock for
180 days after the Effective Time will be transferred to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand. Any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore
complied with this Article 1 will thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Price Per Share in accordance with this
Agreement upon surrender of such Certificates.   (b) No Escheat of Remaining
Funds. None of Holdings, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent will be
liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered from the Funds to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificates have not been surrendered before seven years
after the Effective Time (or immediately before such earlier date on which
any payment pursuant to this Section 1.13 would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), the aggregate Price Per
Share payable in respect to such Certificates will, unless otherwise provided
by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Governmental Entity" means any
supranational, foreign, national, state, municipal or local government, any
instrumentality, subdivision, court, administrative agency or commission or
other authority thereof, or any quasi-governmental or private body exercising
any regulatory, taxing or other governmental or quasi-
governmental authority.   (c) Merger Consideration. Any portion of the
Funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 1.11(a) to pay
the Price Per Share for shares of the Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for which appraisal
rights have been perfected shall be returned to Holdings, upon
demand.        -6-  12  1.14 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding
Section 1.9 hereof, shares of the Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has
properly demanded and perfected such holder\'s right to dissent from the
Merger and to be paid the fair value of such shares in accordance with
Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA (and who has neither effectively
withdrawn nor lost his right to dissent) ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted into a right to receive cash pursuant to Section 1.9, and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by the
MBCA. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws
or otherwise loses his right to dissent, such shares of Company Common Stock
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive cash as provided in Section 1.9, without
interest thereon. The Company shall give Holdings reasonably prompt notice of
any demands for payment received by the Company under Sections 302A.471 and
302A.473 of the MBCA, and Holdings shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Holdings, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.    ARTICLE 2 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   2.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by
the Company to Holdings at or prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (the Company Disclosure
Schedule is arranged by sections corresponding to the lettered and numbered
sections contained in this Section 2.1 and the disclosure in any one section
of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall qualify only that particular section
of this Section 2.1 unless a cross-reference is made to another lettered or
numbered section to which such disclosure also qualifies or the context of
such disclosure makes it reasonably clear, if read in the context of such
other lettered or numbered section, that such disclosure affects or modifies

Company, no parties to the Leases are in material breach or default of  such
leases.   (ii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries  is
obligated under or bound by any agreement, option, right of first  refusal,

way of furnishing non-public information) or take any action knowingly to
facilitate the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers (whether or
not in writing) from any Person (other than Holdings and its affiliates),
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that constitute,
or are reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined
below), or (b) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that, at any time
during the period following the execution of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, if the Company receives a proposal or offer that was

Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors) is a Superior Proposal (as defined
below but ignoring, for purposes of this Section 4.4(a) only, clause (i) of
the definition of Superior Proposal), and subject to compliance with Section
4.4(b), the Company Board may, or may authorize any committee thereof or any
Company Representatives to, (x) furnish information with respect to the

modify, in any manner adverse to Holdings, the approval or recommendation of
this Agreement or the Merger, or propose publicly to approve or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal, unless the withdrawal or modification of such approval
or recommendation or such approval or recommendation is, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board or such committee thereof (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel), necessary to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable law. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company nor the Company Board
nor any committee thereof from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Company\'s shareholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Company Board or such committee thereof
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
shareholders or other obligations under applicable law.       -29-  
35   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.4
or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may,

confidential information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf
of the Company to return or destroy all such information in the possession of
any such party or in the possession of any agent or advisor of any such
party. The Company agrees not to release any third party from or waive any
provisions of confidentiality in any confidentiality agreement to which the
Company is a party.   (e) "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal
or offer for (i) an acquisition or purchase of 10 percent or more of

Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer (including a self tender offer) or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning 10 percent or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, sale of substantially all assets, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 10
percent or more of the consolidated assets of the Company.  (f) "Superior
Proposal" means a proposal with respect to any of the transactions described

counsel and financial advisor, (i) is reasonably likely to be completed,
taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the

For purposes of determining eligibility to participate or vesting where
length of service is relevant under any employee benefit plan or arrangement
of the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall

(A) the Company shall have complied with the terms of Section 4.4 and (B)
this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this Section 6.3(b) unless
(x) concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to Holdings the
Termination Fee (as hereinafter defined) less any Expense Payment (as
hereinafter defined) previously paid and (y) the Company shall have provided
Holdings with at least five business days\' advance notice of
such termination and Holdings does not make, within four (4) business days of
receipt of the Company\'s notification of its intention to terminate this

consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, is at
least as favorable to the shareholders of the Company as such Superior
Proposal.   6.4 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.   (a) In the event of termination
of this Agreement by either the Company or Holdings as provided in this
Article 6, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Holdings, Merger Sub or the Company or
their respective officers, directors, shareholders, affiliates,
representatives, agents, employees or advisors, except, with respect to
Holdings, Merger Sub and the Company, (i) with respect to Section 4.6, this
Section 6.4, Article 7 and the last sentence of Section 4.2 and (ii) with
respect to any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party as a

Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d), promptly, but in no event later than

their respective agents and counsel, and fees of counsel, accountants,
financial printers, advisors, experts and consultants to Holdings and its
affiliates) (either of the payments in clauses (i) or (ii) being referred to
herein as the "Expense Payment"). It is understood that in the event that
Holdings is paid a Termination Fee, to the extent not previously paid, the
Expense Payment shall not be paid.   (c) In the event that this Agreement
is terminated by Holdings pursuant to Section 6.2(a) or by the Company
pursuant to Section 6.3(b), the Company shall pay to Holdings, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Holdings
on the next business day following such termination (or, in the case of a
termination by the Company pursuant to Section 6.3(b), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Holdings,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such termination), an amount equal to
$20 million (the "Termination Fee"), less any Expense Payment previously
paid.   (d) If all of the following events have occurred:   (i) (A) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to  Section 6.1(c) (other than on account of
a failure of the conditions  set forth in Sections 5.1(a), 5.1(c), 5.2(c),
5.2(d), 5.3(a) or  5.3(b)), Section 6.1(d) or Section 6.2(b) and (B) an
Acquisition  Proposal is publicly disclosed or publicly proposed to the
Company or  its shareholders at any time on or after the date of this
Agreement but  (x) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 6.1(c) or
Section  6.2(b), prior to such termination, or (y) in the case of a
termination  pursuant to Section 6.1(d), prior to or at the time of the
Special  Meeting; and   (ii) thereafter, within 12 months of the date of
such  termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with 
respect to, or consummates, the Acquisition Proposal referred to in  clause
(i), or any proposal with respect to any of the transactions  described in
clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of Acquisition  Proposal (with
all of the percentages included in the definition of  such term raised to 50%
for purposes of this definition); then, the  Company shall pay to Holdings,
concurrently with the earlier of the  execution of such definitive agreement
or the consummation of such  Acquisition Proposal, an amount equal to the
Termination Fee (less any  Expense Payment previously paid).   (e) The
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Sections 6.4(b), (c)
and (d) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Holdings and Merger Sub would
not enter into this Agreement.     -37-    43    6.5 AMENDMENT. This
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized
by their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after adoption
of this Agreement by the Company\'s shareholders, but, after any such
adoption, no amendment shall be made which by law or in accordance with the
rules of the NASDAQ requires further approval by such shareholders without
such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.   6.6
EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party. No delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any waiver on the part of any party hereto of any right, power or
privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. Unless
otherwise provided, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the parties hereto may
otherwise have at law or in equity. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights.    ARTICLE 7  GENERAL
PROVISIONS   7.1 NON-SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES
AND AGREEMENTS; NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. None of
the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement,

warranties, covenants and other agreements, shall survive the Effective Time,

Effective Time and/or the provisions of this Article 7. Each party hereto

representations and warranties made by itself or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, financial and legal advisors or

Agreement, the documents and the instruments referred to herein, or the

is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference
shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents, cross references and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statue
or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the content requires otherwise. It is understood and
agreed that neither the specifications of any dollar amount in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules or Exhibits
is intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included or other items, are or are not material, and neither party
shall use the fact of setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of
such item in the Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter is or is not
material for purposes hereof.     -40-   46    7.4 COUNTERPARTS.
This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (including by
means of telecopied signature pages), all of which shall be considered one
and the same agreement and shall become effective when two or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the same
counterpart.   7.5 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARIES; LIABILITY.   (a) This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.   (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely
to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than Section 4.7 (which is intended to be for the benefit of
the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such Persons).   (c) No
affiliate, officer, director or shareholder of any party hereto shall have
any liability hereunder.   7.6 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be
governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota,
without regard to the laws that might be applicable under conflicts of laws
principles.   7.7 SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law
or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. Any
provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part,
degree or certain jurisdictions will remain in full force and effect to the
extent not held invalid or unenforceable. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, each party waives any provision of law which renders any
provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect.   7.8 ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or
otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.      -41-    47    7.9
ENFORCEMENT. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.   * * * *
