1.6_. CEA shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for payment received

 (c) The Indemnity Escrow Amount will be held by the Escrow Agent as security for the obligations of the Former Securityholders to Parent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including those set forth in _Section 7.2_ hereof. The Additional Escrow Amount will be held by the Escrow Agent as partial security for the obligations of the Former Securityholders to Parent pursuant to the terms of Section 1.10 below.

The Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent on the General Survival Date (except to the extent any claims of the Parent Claimants are then outstanding) and otherwise pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Aggregate Escrow Amount shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow 

      #####

_Section 1.6(c)_ or _Section 1.6(d)_, as applicable. 

   

 (d) If at the expiration of the term of the Escrow Agreement there are amounts available for disbursement to the Former Securityholders in accordance with the terms of such agreement, the Securityholders Representative may direct the disbursement instead to be deposited in the Former Securityholders Escrow Account. Any such amounts so deposited shall then become subject to the terms of _Section 8.14_. 

   

 1.10 _Merger Consideration Adjustments_. The Merger Consideration shall be subject to adjustment as set forth below and all references in this Agreement to the Merger Consideration shall be deemed to be the Merger Consideration as adjusted pursuant to this _Section 1.10_.

At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, CEA shall prepare and deliver to Parent an estimated consolidated balance sheet of CEA and the Company (the " _Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), as of 12:01 a.m. (central time) on the Closing Date (the " _Adjustment Effective Time_ "), which shall include (1) the estimated Net Working Capital, as of the Adjustment Effective Time (" _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (2) the estimated Capital Lease Amount as of the Adjustment Effective Time (the " _Estimated Capital Lease Amount_ "), (3) the estimated Stay Bonus Amount as of the Adjustment Effective Time (the " _Estimated Stay Bonus Amount_ "), (4) the Tax Adjustment Amount as of the Adjustment Effective Time, and (5) the Change in Tax Accounting Method Amount (the " _Change in Tax Accounting Method Amount_ ", together with the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Capital Lease Amount, the Estimated Stay Bonus Amount and the Tax Adjustment Amount are hereafter referred to as the " _Section 1.10(b) Adjustment Amounts_"). The Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Section 1.10(b) Adjustment Amounts (including all components thereof) shall be prepared by CEA in good faith and in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the 2009 Audited Financial Statements. CEA shall promptly provide Parent access to all relevant documents and information reasonably requested by Parent in connection with its review of the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Section 1.10(b) Adjustment Amounts (including all components thereof). Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall notify CEA of any objections to the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Section 1.10(b) Adjustment Amounts (including any component thereof). If Parent has any such objections, CEA and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such objections, and the obligation of Parent, Merger Sub and CEA Merger Sub to close these transactions will be subject to Parents agreement to CEAs determination and calculation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Section 1.10(b) Adjustment Amounts 

      ##### 

  

    

(including all components thereof); provided, however, that Parent, Merger Sub
and CEA Merger Sub shall be obligated to close these transactions
notwithstanding any unresolved objection if the amounts subject to any
objection are less than $1,000,000 in the aggregate. The Merger Consideration
to be paid at Closing by Parent shall, if (i) (a) the Estimated Net Working
Capital, less (b) the Estimated Capital Lease Amount, less (c) the Estimated
Stay Bonus Amount, less (d) the Tax Adjustment Amount, less (e) the Change in
Tax Accounting Method Amount (such amount calculated in accordance with
clause (i), the " _Estimated Balance Sheet Amount_ "), exceeds (ii)
the Target Net Working Capital, be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by
the amount of such excess, or, (ii) if (x) the Estimated Balance Sheet
Amount, is less than (y) the Target Net Working Capital, be decreased on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such deficiency. 

   

 (c) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration Following the Closing_. If the amount of the Net Working Capital (including, for purposes of this calculation and all adjustments pursuant to this _Section 1.10(c)_ and _Section 1.10(d)_, all Cash and Cash Equivalents) as of the Adjustment Effective Time (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.10(d)_, is less than the amount of the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Merger Consideration shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the difference. If the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.10(d)_ below is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Merger Consideration shall be increased dollar-for-dollar by the difference. If (x) the Capital Lease Amount as of the Adjustment Effective Time (the " _Closing Capital Lease Amount_ "), plus (y) the Stay Bonus Amount as of the Adjustment Effective Time (the " _Closing Stay Bonus Amount_ "), in each case as finally determined following the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.10(d)_ below, is greater than (A) the Estimated Capital Lease Amount, plus (B) the Estimated Stay Bonus Amount, the Merger Consideration shall be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such excess. If (x) the Closing Capital Lease Amount, plus (y) the Closing Stay Bonus Amount, in each case as finally determined following the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.10(d)_ below, is less than (A) the Estimated Capital Lease Amount, plus (B) the Estimated Stay Bonus Amount, the Merger Consideration shall be increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such deficiency. Any payments or adjustments by or to the Parent Claimants following the Closing in respect of the Tax Payables or Tax Receivables shall be determined in accordance with _Section 4.11_ below. 

   

 (d) _Post-Closing Procedures_. The determination of the adjustments, if any, required to be made to the Merger Consideration pursuant to clause (c) of this _Section 1.10_ shall be made pursuant to the following provisions: 

   

 (i) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and CEA effective as of the Adjustment Effective Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") as well as a calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Capital Lease Amount and the Closing Stay Bonus Amount (the Closing Balance Sheet Amount, the Closing Capital Lease Amount and the Closing Stay Bonus Amount are hereafter referred to as the " _Section 1.10(c) Adjustment Amounts_"), and deliver to Securityholders Representative the Closing Balance Sheet, as well as calculations of the Section 1.10(c) Adjustment Amounts, if any, required to be made to the Merger Consideration pursuant to clause (d) of this  _Section 1.10_ (the " _Schedule of Adjustments_ "). Parent shall supply Securityholders Representative supporting documentation containing 

   ##### 

  

 

reasonable detail as to the components or calculations of the Section 1.10(c)
Adjustment Amounts (including all components thereof) promptly upon
Securityholders Representatives written request. 

   

 (ii) Securityholders Representative will have a period of thirty (30) days following the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet as well as a calculation of the Section 1.10(c) Adjustment Amounts (including all components thereof) and the Schedule of Adjustments to notify Parent of any disagreements with any of the foregoing. Any such notice shall be accompanied by supporting documentation containing reasonable detail. Failure to notify Parent within such 30-day period shall be deemed acceptance of the Closing Balance Sheet as well as the calculation of the Section 1.10(c) Adjustment Amounts (including all components thereof) and the Schedule of Adjustments. If Securityholders Representative timely notifies Parent of any disagreement, the parties agree that each of them will attempt in good faith to resolve such disagreement. If within thirty (30) days after delivery to Parent of the notification by Securityholders Representative of a disagreement, the parties are unable to resolve such disagreement, either Parent, on the one hand, or Securityholders Representative, on the other hand, shall have the right to submit the determination of such matters to an independent accountant of national standing reasonably acceptable to Securityholders Representative and Parent (the " _Independent Auditor_ "), whose decision shall be binding on the parties. The cost of the Independent Auditor shall be paid by the party or parties whose aggregate estimate of the disputed amount or amounts, as the case may be, differs most greatly from the determination of the Independent Auditor. 

  

 (iii) If it is finally determined pursuant to this clause (d) that any amount is payable by Parent in accordance with clause (c) of this _Section 1.10_, Parent shall, remit such difference to the Paying Agent or to CEAs payroll agent in cash, to be allocated among the Former Securityholders in the manner set forth in _Section 1.6(b)_ or _Section 1.6(c)_, as applicable; notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to remit any portion of such amount attributable to Dissenting Shares. 

  

 (iv) If it is determined pursuant to this clause (d) that any amount is payable to Parent in accordance with clause (c) of this _Section 1.10_, the Securityholders Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to remit such difference to Parent in cash from the Additional Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. In the event that the Additional Escrow Amount is insufficient to make the required payment, then the Securityholders Representative shall cause the Former Securityholders to remit, on a several basis, such shortfall to Parent. 

  

 (v) Any cash payment to be made as a result of adjustments made in accordance with clauses (c) and (d) of this _Section 1.10_ shall be paid within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of such adjustments by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent regarding the release of the Additional Escrow Amount within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the adjustment to the Merger Consideration as determined pursuant to clauses (c) and (d) of this _Section 1.10_. Any such payment shall be made to such account or accounts as may be designated by the party or parties entitled to such payment at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date that such payment is to be made.

 (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or otherwise facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including any proposal from or offer to the Companys or CEAs stockholders) with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

      ##### 

  

    

CEA, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
stockholders of CEA (other than the Company) listed in Section 2.2 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule who have not delivered a written consent in
accordance with _Section 4.8(a)_ to thereafter execute and deliver the
Company Written Consent or CEA Written Consent, as applicable. In furtherance
thereof, the Company and CEA shall promptly, but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days following the date of the Written Consents executed in
accordance with _Section 4.8(a)_ thereof, deliver to all stockholders of the
Company and CEA other than the stockholders of the Company and CEA
that executed the Written Consents in accordance with _Section 4.8(a)_

the foregoing, the Company shall also deliver such notices and take such
other actions as are required to be taken prior to the Closing in order
to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if applicable with
respect to appraisal and dissenters rights. 

   

 (c) _Board Recommendation_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not withdraw, alter, modify, change or revoke its recommendation to the stockholders of the Company to vote in favor of the Merger nor its approval of the Merger. The Board of Directors of CEA shall not withdraw, alter, modify, change or revoke its recommendation to the stockholders of CEA to vote in favor of the CEA Merger nor its approval of the CEA Merger. 

   

 (d) _Section 280G Approval_. Prior to the Closing, the Company and CEA will take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and its organizational documents to (i) conduct a separate vote of their stockholders and perform such other acts as are within its power to satisfy all of the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder for exemption of any compensation or other payment payable under any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any disqualified individual (as such term is defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) that would give rise to any "excess parachute payment," as that term is defined in Section 280G(b) of the Code, and (ii) obtain the consent of each such disqualified individual to conditionally waive the smallest portion necessary under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder of any such payments that are not so approved, such that after giving effect to such vote and all related waivers and other agreements, if the requisite number of affirmative votes are obtained, such payments, awards and benefits will qualify for the exemption provided under Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code and will not be subject to any excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code. 

   

 4.9 _Benefit Arrangements_. 

  

 (a) Parent agrees that all employees of the Company and CEA who continue employment with the CEA Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any Affiliate thereof after the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") shall be eligible to continue to participate in the Companys and CEAs health, vacation, welfare and retirement benefit plans through at least December 2010, and that Parent shall ensure that the CEA Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or an Affiliate thereof maintains the previously adopted 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, the 2010 Hospital Sales Incentive Plan  Account 

      ##### 

  

    

Management Positions, the 2010 Sales Incentive Plan  RVP, Business
Development, and the Sales Incentive Plan  VP, New Markets including the
thresholds, targets and other provisions through at least December 2010, and
that all payments due thereunder shall be made in accordance therewith;
provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 4.9_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or any Affiliate thereof,
including the CEA Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Corporation, to
amend or terminate any such benefit plan or arrangement at any time after
December 2010, and if Parent or any Affiliate thereof, including the CEA
Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Corporation, terminates any such plan,
then (upon expiration of any appropriate transition period), the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in Parents benefit plans and
vacation policies, in each case to the same extent as employees of Parent in
similar positions and compensation grade levels. Continuing Employees
shall receive credit for service time as an employee of the Company and CEA
for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, and eligibility to
receive benefits under any such Parent benefit plan and for purposes of
vacation accrual for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective
Time to the extent past service was recognized for such Continuing Employees
under the comparable Company Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and to the same extent past service is credited under such plans or
arrangements for similarly situated employees of Parent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 4.9(a)_ shall be construed to
require crediting of service that would result in (A) duplication of
benefits, (B) service credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit
pension plan, or (C) service credit under a newly established plan for which
prior service is not taken into account for employees of Parent and
its Affiliates generally. Additionally, any life, health and disability
benefits available to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents
under Parents benefit plans shall not be subject to any insurability
requirement or pre-existing condition exclusion that would not apply to the
corresponding benefit provided under a Company Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall further provide each Continuing Employee, to the
extent commercially practicable, with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs in satisfying any applicable deductibles or out-of-
pocket requirements under corresponding Parent benefit plans. 

   

 (b) Immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Company and CEA shall cease contributions to, and terminate the Chamberlin Edmonds and Associates Inc. 401(k) Plan (the " _401(k) Plan_ "). In connection therewith, the Company and CEA shall (i) cause their respective board of directors to adopt written resolutions, to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.3(f), to terminate the 401(k) Plan and one hundred percent (100%) vest all participants under the 401(k) Plan, such termination and vesting to be effective immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) deliver, prior to Closing, notice of the 401(k) Plan termination to any trustees and custodians of the 401(k) Plan and/or its assets. Parent reserves the right to suspend the distribution of benefits from the 401(k) Plan until the later of the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to the termination of the 401(k) Plan or the completion of final testing and record keeping for the 401(k) Plan. 

   

 (c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 4.9_ are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any Continuing Employees, any participant in 

      ##### 

  

    

any Parent benefit plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to
continued employment with Parent or any of its Affiliates. 

   

 4.10 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger or the CEA Merger is consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger or the CEA Merger including, without limitation, all legal, accounting, financial advisory, finders, consulting and all other fees and expenses of third parties incurred by a party in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by (i) in the case of any such fees or expenses of the Company, CEA or the stockholders of the Company or CEA, the stockholders of the Company and CEA in accordance with _Section 1.6(a)(ii)_ hereof (and, subject to the foregoing, to the extent any such fees or expenses are liabilities of the Surviving Corporation or the CEA Surviving Corporation, shall be taken into account in determining the Estimated Net Working Capital and Closing Net Working Capital, as applicable, pursuant to the terms hereof), and (ii) in the case of any such fees or expenses of Parent, Merger Sub or CEA Merger Sub, Parent, Merger Sub or CEA Merger Sub. 

 

4.11 _Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the obligations and
allocation of responsibility as between the parties for certain Tax
matters: 

   

 (a) _Tax Returns_. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to cooperate with each other party in the preparation of any Tax Returns to the extent of any reasonable request. The Company and CEA shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed their Tax Returns that are required to be filed prior to the Closing Date, and each such Tax Return shall be reflective of and consistent with past practices of the Company and CEA except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and CEA other than those Tax Returns that are required to be filed prior to the Closing Date. For any income Tax Return of the Company or CEA required to be filed after the Closing Date that includes a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date and ends on the Closing Date, or in the case of any income Tax Return required to be filed that involves a Straddle Period as defined in 4.11(c) and involves a potential Tax liability of more than $10,000 (each a " _CEA 2010 Income Tax Return_ ") (i) Parent shall deliver to Securityholders Representative for review and comment a copy of the proposed Tax Return no later than 30 days prior to the filing date of such Tax Return (including extensions thereof), (ii) Parent shall prepare the proposed Tax Return in a manner not materially inconsistent with the past practice of the Company in preparing any similar Tax Return except as otherwise required by applicable Law, and Parent shall not take any position or adopt any method in respect of any such Tax Return that is materially inconsistent with the positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing or filing such similar Tax Return in prior periods except as otherwise required by Law; and in each case, such Tax Return shall be in conformity with the Code, Treasury Regulations and any other applicable Law, and (iii) Parent shall accept the reasonable written comments of the Securityholders Representative in respect of any such Tax Return, provided that if the Securityholders Representative does not provide written comments to any such Tax Return within 15 days of the delivery of such Tax Return to the Securityholders Representative it shall be deemed to have no comments on such Tax Return. 

   

 (b) _Taxes Payable_. Notwithstanding and in lieu of the procedures set forth in Section 7.4, upon Parents request, the Securityholders Representative shall authorize transfer to 

      ##### 

  

    

Parent from the Escrow Account in immediately available funds within 15 days
following the filing of the applicable Tax Return, an amount equal to (i) the
Taxes shown as owing on all CEA 2010 Income Tax Returns, if any, less the Tax
Adjustment Amount (ii) the Taxes shown as owing on all other Tax Returns
filed by Parent that include a period that ends on the Closing Date (other
than the CEA 2010 Income Tax Returns) except to the extent such Taxes were
included as a liability in the computation of Net Working Capital (as finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.10), and (iii) the Former Securityholders
share of Taxes owing on all Tax Returns filed or caused to be filed by Parent
that includes a Straddle Period except to the extent such Taxes were included
as a liability in the computation of Net Working Capital (as finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.10), which share shall be that portion of
the Taxes for the Straddle Period that are properly allocable to the period
that the Former Securityholders owned the Company Shares and the CEA Shares as
described in Section 4.11(c). If the Taxes shown as owing on any Tax Return
filed pursuant to (i) or (ii) above are less than the amount of Taxes paid by
the Company or CEA prior to the Closing Date in respect of such Taxes
(including the Tax Adjustment Amount) (in each case, an " _Overpayment_ ")
Parent shall pay over to the Securityholders Representative on behalf of the
Former Securityholders any such Overpayment within 15 days following the
filing of such Tax Return. 

   

 (c) _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company or CEA, as the case may be, for any taxable period of the Company or CEA that includes (but does not end on or before) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the determination of the Taxes of the Company or CEA for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, and state and local apportionment factors of the Company and CEA for the Straddle Period, shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company and CEA were closed at the close of the Closing Date. However, (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, and (ii) periodic Taxes such as real and personal property Taxes shall be apportioned ratably between such periods on a daily basis. 

   

 (d) _Tax Benefit for Stay Bonus Amount_. In the event that Parent, the Company, or CEA receives a deduction in computing federal income Taxes for any income Tax period beginning after the Closing Date, in connection with the payment of any Stay Bonus Amount or with respect to a holder of CEA Options (whether paid out of the Escrow Account or otherwise), then Parent, the Company, or CEA shall pay to the Securityholders Representative on behalf of the Former Securityholders the tax benefit of such deduction, which shall be presumed to equal 38% of the amount of such deduction (" _Tax Benefit_ "). In the event that Parent, the Company, or CEA become liable for any payroll Taxes with respect to the payment of any such Stay Bonus Amount or with respect to a holder of CEA Options (whether paid out of the Escrow Account or otherwise), but not including payroll Taxes that are recovered through withholding from any such payment, then the amount of the Tax Benefit may be reduced by the amount of such payroll Taxes. Any such payment due hereunder, as adjusted herein, shall be 

      ##### 

  

    

payable within 15 days following the due date, including extensions, of the
Parents, the Companys, or CEAs applicable federal income Tax Return on
which such deduction is claimed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amount
shall be payable hereunder unless the Companys consolidated federal taxable
income for the tax period ending on the Closing Date as reduced by the Stay
Bonus Amount is greater than zero; provided, however, that in the event that
such taxable income is greater than zero before reduction of the Stay Bonus
Amount and any payment with respect to CEA Options that is not properly
deductible for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date, but less than
zero after such reductions, then, for purposes of computing the Tax Benefit as
set forth in the previous sentence, the total of the amount of the Stay Bonus
Amount and the payments with respect to CEA Options that shall be taken into
account in computing the Tax Benefit shall be equal to that amount which
reduces taxable income to an amount equal to zero. For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties acknowledge that the Stay Bonus Amount will not be
deducted on the Companys consolidated federal income Tax Return that is
filed with the Internal Revenue Service for the tax period ending on the
Closing Date, but rather, such amount will be treated as deductible on
such Tax Return solely for the purpose of determining whether the Tax Benefit
is payable hereunder. 

   

 (e) _Tax Treatment_. All payments under this Section 4.11 shall be treated by the parties for income Tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price paid for the Company Shares and the CEA Shares.

    

 (f) _Resolution of Tax Related Issues_. Securityholders Representative and Parent agree to consult and attempt to resolve in good faith any disagreement or issue arising (i) as a result of the review of proposed Tax Returns under Section 4.11(a) and (ii) with respect to the calculation and allocation of Taxes under Section 4.11(c). If Securityholders Representative and Parent cannot agree upon the resolution of any such issues that are material within 15 days, Parent and Securityholders Representative shall refer the matter to an Independent Auditor (which solely for purposes of this Section shall be an accounting firm of national reputation that is not regularly engaged by either party) for resolution, provided that, the Independent Auditor shall not concur with a position proposed by a party unless such position meets the more likely than not standard (as contemplated in FIN 48 under GAAP). Parent and Former Securityholders shall each bear 50% of the fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor and its determination shall be final and binding on both Parent and Former Securityholders, unless otherwise reversed by a Taxing Authority. 

   

 (g) _Other Tax Matters_. Notwithstanding and in lieu of the procedures set forth in  _Section 7.4_, Parent shall promptly notify Securityholders Representative in writing upon receipt by Parent, the Company, or CEA of written notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit or Tax assessment which may affect the income tax liabilities of the Company or CEA and for which the Former Securityholders would be liable under this Agreement, provided that such notice is received by Parent, the Company or CEA prior to the General Survival Date. The Securityholders Representative (and its designated representatives) shall have the right to participate, at its sole cost and expense, in any Tax matter, including any audit or administrative or judicial proceeding, or the filing of any amended Tax Return, which involves or results in a material Tax liability or potential material Tax liability for which the Former Securityholders would be liable under this Agreement and that is commenced or filed prior to the General 

      ##### 

  

    

Survival Date (" _CEA Interested Tax Matter_ "). Parent shall cooperate fully
with the Securityholders Representative (and its designated representatives)
in the defense or compromise of any such CEA Interested Tax Matter. In no
case shall Parent, the Company or CEA settle or otherwise compromise any such
CEA Interested Tax Matter (including the filing of an amended Tax Return)
without the prior approval of Securityholders Representative, which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

   

 4.12 _Change of Control Payments_. The Company and CEA shall pay, prior to the Closing, all change of control and similar payments (excluding the Stay Bonus Amounts) required to be made by the Company or CEA to any of its employees or any other Persons in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

 

 4.13 _Payment of Indebtedness and Related Party Amounts_. At or prior to Closing, (i) the Company and CEA shall have paid or otherwise satisfied (or cause to be paid or otherwise satisfied) in full all Indebtedness payable by the Company or CEA to any Person (including, without limitation, all amounts payable by the Company or CEA pursuant to the GE Debt Financing, but excluding all amounts payable under capital leases of the Company and CEA), and (ii) the Company and CEA shall have paid or otherwise satisfied (or caused to be paid or otherwise satisfied) in full all amounts payable to the Company or CEA by any CEA Related Person or Company Related Person, and all amounts payable by the Company or CEA to any CEA Related Person or Company Related Person (including all amounts payable by the Company or CEA under the Management Agreement, which the Company and CEA shall cause to be terminated at or prior to the Closing and shall provide evidence of the same to Parent at or prior to Closing in form reasonably acceptable to Parent). Prior to Closing, the Company and CEA shall fully resolve (and obtain full releases in connection therewith) the claim by certain former shareholders of the Company and/or CEA pursuant to the 2008 Merger Agreement pertaining to such former shareholders rights to receive certain refunds of federal income taxes, which liability is reflected in the Sample Balance Sheet in the amount of $888,397 (the " _2008 Merger Agreement Refund Claim_ "). 

   

 4.14 _SEC Filings_. In order to assist with any potential future SEC filing requirements or disclosures in future SEC filings of Emdeon Inc. in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or the financial results of the acquired business of the Company and CEA, CEA (prior to the Closing) and the Securityholders Representative (following the Closing) shall provide such cooperation as Parent may reasonably request in connection with such filing requirements, including, without limitation, cooperating with Parent in its efforts to cause the independent accountants of the Company and CEA to re-issue their audit opinion on the Companys and CEAs 2009 audited consolidated financial statements and deliver consents to the inclusion or incorporation by reference of such opinion and financial statements in the SEC filings of Emdeon Inc. Parent shall reimburse the Securityholders Representative for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other advisors fees and expenses) incurred by the Securityholders Representative in connection with performing its obligations under this  _Section 4.14_. 

  

 4.15 _Payment of Stay Bonus Amount_. If any portion of the Stay Bonus Amount is not paid pursuant to the terms of the Retention Agreements, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the CEA Surviving Corporation, as appropriate, to remit the unpaid balance of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Stay Bonus Amount to the Securityholders Representative for the benefit of
the Former Securityholders.

to the Companys closing obligations set forth in _Article V_ would not be
satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation
or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if such breach by

of written notice from the Company to Parent, Merger Sub or CEA Merger Sub of
such breach provided Parent, Merger Sub or CEA Merger Sub continues to
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach, or (y) if the
satisfaction of any of the conditions to the Companys closing obligations set
forth in  _Article V_ become impossible, and the Company has not waived such
condition in writing on or before such date, (it being understood that the
Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.1(c)_

 (a) The party seeking indemnification (the " _Claimant_ ") must give the other party or parties, as the case may be (the " _Indemnitor_ "), prompt written notice of any such Claim. The Claimants failure to give prompt notice, however, shall not serve to eliminate or limit the Claimants right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent such failure prejudices the rights of the Indemnitor. 

   

 (b) The respective obligations and liabilities of the Company, the Former Securityholders and Parent to indemnify pursuant to this _Article VII_ in respect of any Claim by a third party shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions: 

   

 (i) The Indemnitor shall have the right to undertake, by counsel or other representatives of its own choosing reasonably satisfactory to Claimant, the defense, compromise, and settlement of such Claim (unless Claimant reasonably determines that a third-party claim may adversely affect it or its Affiliates in any material respect other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement). 

  

 (ii) If the Indemnitor elects not to undertake such defense, or within twenty days after notice of any such Claim from the Claimant shall fail to defend, the Claimant shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Claim, by counsel or other representatives of its own choosing, on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnitor. 

  

 (iii) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.4_ to the contrary, (A) the Indemnitor shall not, without the Claimants written consent, settle or compromise any claim 

   ##### 

  

 

or consent to entry of any judgment unless (x) such compromise or settlement
includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claiming party or
the plaintiff to the Claimant and its Affiliates of a release from all
liability in respect of such claim and such compromise or settlement does not
otherwise require Claimant or its Affiliates to pay any monetary damages,
and (y) there is no finding or admission of any violation of any Legal
Requirement or any violation of the rights of any Person by Claimant or its
Affiliates, and (B) if the Indemnitor undertakes defense of any claim, the
Claimant by counsel or other representative of its own choosing and at its
sole cost and expense, shall have the right to consult with the Indemnitor and
its counsel or other representatives concerning such claim and the Indemnitor
and the Claimant and their respective counsel or other representatives shall
cooperate and keep Claimant informed with respect to such claim, subject to
the execution and delivery of a mutually satisfactory joint
defense agreement. 

   

 (c) With respect to an indemnity notice that is delivered by a Parent Claimant, upon final resolution or acceptance of the amount of damages subject to such indemnity notice (an " _Undisputed Amount_ "), the Escrow Agent upon receipt of joint instructions from Parent and the Securityholders Representative will disburse the amount of such Undisputed Amount to Parent (subject, however, to a maximum payment equal to the remaining balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount), upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement. If the amount of such Undisputed Amount exceeds the remaining balance in the Indemnity Escrow Amount or the Indemnity Escrow Amount has been released in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, then, Parent shall have the right to exercise its other rights and remedies hereunder subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement; provided, further that each Former Securityholders percentage of such Undisputed Amount shall not exceed the percentage of Merger Consideration to which such Former Securityholder is directly or indirectly entitled as computed pursuant to _Schedule 1.6_. 

   

 (d) With respect to an indemnity notice that is delivered by the Securityholders Representative, upon final resolution or acceptance of the amount of Damages subject to such indemnity notice, Parent shall promptly pay the amount of such Damages to the Securityholders Representative (and the Securityholders Representative shall promptly distribute such amount to the Former Securityholders in the same proportion as the distributions to the Former Securityholders of the Merger Consideration). 

   

 (e) Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent regarding the release of the Indemnity Escrow Amount within five (5) Business Days of the final resolution or acceptance of an Undisputed Amount. 

   

 7.5 _Indemnification Payments Constitute Adjustments of Merger Consideration_. Any indemnification payment hereunder shall constitute an adjustment of the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, and no party hereto shall take a position inconsistent therewith. 

  

 7.6 _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Party shall be entitled to indemnification under any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such Party or its Affiliates or Representatives have been indemnified or reimbursed by, or received an offset benefit actually exercised in respect of, any Former Securityholder, insurance company or other third party (net of any applicable deductibles or 

    ##### 

 

  

similar costs or payments and costs of recovery or collection thereof). In
addition, if at any time following the payment of an indemnification
obligation, the Claimant receives insurance proceeds or other third party
recoveries (including offset rights actually exercised or Tax benefits
actually realized) in respect of the related Damages, the value of any such
amount will promptly be repaid by Claimant to the Indemnitor (net of any
applicable deductibles or similar costs or payments and costs of recovery or
collection thereof). 

   

 7.7 _Exclusivity_. After the Closing, the indemnities set forth in this _Article VII_ will be the exclusive remedies of the Parent Claimants and Seller Claimants for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or nonfulfillment or failure to be performed of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and the Parties will not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement or to any further indemnification rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which the Parties hereto hereby waive, provided, however, that the limitations herein will not limit or restrict (i) any right to recovery for fraud, or (ii) any Person who is a party to the Employment Agreements, the Restrictive Covenant Agreements, the Letters of Transmittal or the Release and Agreements to obtain Damages or any other legal or equitable relief from any other Person who is a party to any such agreement in connection with the breach of such agreement by such other Person pursuant to the terms thereof. 

  

 7.8 _No Double Materiality_. For purposes of calculating the amount of Damages to which the Parent Claimants and Securityholder Claimants are entitled under this _Article VII_ (but not for purposes of determining whether a representation or warranty has been breached), the terms "material," "materiality," and "material adverse effect" will be disregarded.
