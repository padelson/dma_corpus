representations and warranties set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged by the parties), intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and the provisions of applicable Law, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. For times and periods
after the Effective Time, the surviving corporation after the Merger is
sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation."

  

  

1.2 Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place as
promptly as reasonably practicable, but no later than five (5) Business Days
following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, at
the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times Square,
New York, New York 10036, or by exchange of documents (with signatures and
.pdf) by electronic transmission, unless another place, date or time is agreed
to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing Date." At the Closing,
the parties shall deliver the agreements, certificates, and other instruments
and documents required to be delivered at or prior to the Closing pursuant to
Article VI. On the Closing Date, (i) the Company shall execute and deliver a
Certificate of Merger, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D
(the "Certificate of Merger"), and (ii) the parties hereto shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the time of acceptance by the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware of such filing or such later time as may be agreed to by
the parties and set forth in such filing for the effectiveness of the Merger
being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").

  

  

1.3 Effect of the Merger on Constituent Corporations. At the Effective Time,
the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Merger Sub and the Company shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of Merger Sub and the Company shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to be identical to the
form of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended and restated, shall
be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable Law;
provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in
its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Hooklogic,
Inc.". From and after the Effective Time, the bylaws, as amended, of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to be identical to the
form of the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance
with applicable Law.

  

  

1.5 Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. The directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, each to hold
office in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. In
addition, unless otherwise determined by Parent and notified to Company prior
to the Effective Time or otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the directors and officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors and
officers, respectively, of each of the Subsidiaries of the Company immediately
after the Effective Time, each to hold office as a director or officer of each
such Company Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the
respective jurisdiction of organization and the respective bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents of each such Company Subsidiary.

  

  

1.6 Aggregate Consideration.

  

  

(a) The aggregate amount (including any amounts withheld pursuant to Section
1.14) of consideration to be paid or reserved for issuance in the Merger shall
be Two Hundred and Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000), subject to the
adjustments set forth in Section 1.6(b) below (as adjusted, the "Aggregate
Consideration"), which shall consist of the sum of the following amounts:

  

  

(i) an amount (the "Initial Amount"), which shall be payable upon the Closing
in cash to the Company Holders at Closing in accordance with Section 1.7(a)

of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL or, if
applicable, the CCC, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares
shall receive payment therefor in accordance with the DGCL or, if applicable,
the CCC (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or
finally determined pursuant to such provisions).

of shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal of such shares under
the DGCL or, if applicable, the CCC, shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of
the later of (i) the Effective Time, or (ii) the occurrence of such event,
such holder's shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive the applicable consideration for Company Capital Stock as
provided in Section 1.7, without interest thereon, upon surrender to the
Company of the certificate representing such shares in accordance with Section
1.11.

  

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt, but within at least two (2)
Business Days, written notice of its receipt of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments relating to such demands served pursuant to the DGCL

extent pay off letters have been delivered to Parent no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Exchange Procedures.

  

  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event no later than seven (7) Business Days thereafter, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to (x) each holder
of record of certificates of shares of Company Capital Stock that were
converted into the right to receive the cash payment pursuant to Section

Warrant whose Company Warrants were converted into the right to receive a
portion of the Aggregate Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8(d) at the
address provided by the Company in the Final Allocation Certificate: (1) a
letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit E
(a "Letter of Transmittal") and (2) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Company Stock Certificates or Company Warrants, as the case
may be, in exchange for the applicable cash amount set forth on the Final
Allocation Certificate. The parties hereto acknowledge that the Company may
provide the Letter of Transmittal to certain holders of Capital Stock agreed
upon by the Company and Parent in writing (email pursuant to Section 9.1 being
sufficient) prior to the Closing and, provided such Letters of Transmittal are
completed and returned to the Payment Agent prior to the Closing and deemed to
be effective at the Effective Time, Parent shall cause payment to be made to
such holders of Capital Stock on, or promptly following, the Closing Date.
Upon surrender of Company Stock Certificates or Company Warrants for
cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal
and any required Form W-9 or Form W-8, duly completed and validly executed in

thereof the cash amount, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
1.7(a) or Section 1.8(d), as applicable, as set forth on the Final Allocation

Stock Certificate or Company Warrant will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes to evidence only the right to
receive the cash amount (without interest) into which such shares of Company
Capital Stock or Company Warrants shall have been so converted, as set forth
on the Final Allocation Certificate. No portion of the Aggregate Consideration
will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificates or
Company Warrants with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock or Company
Warrants formerly represented thereby until the holder of record of such
Company Stock Certificates or Company Warrants shall surrender such Company
Stock Certificates or Company Warrants and the Letter of Transmittal pursuant
hereto.

  

  

(ii) Each Company Holder shall also be entitled to any amounts payable in the
future in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by

to Section 1.7 in accordance with the Final Allocation Certificate to any
person other than the person or entity whose name is reflected on the Company
Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefore, it will be a condition of
the issuance or delivery thereof that (i) the Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment will have paid to
Parent, or any agent designated by it, any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of payment in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Company Stock Certificate surrendered, or established
to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable.

  

  

(d) No Interest With Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Company Capital Stock.
No interest will be paid or accrue for the benefit of any holder of Company
Capital Stock or Company Warrants or Vested Optionholders or any Aggregate
Consideration or other amounts payable under this Article I.

  

  

(e) Payment Agent to Return Cash Consideration. At any time following the last
day of the sixth (6th) month following the Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled to require the Payment Agent to deliver to Parent or its designated
successor or assign (or if Parent is acting as the Payment Agent it shall
release to itself) all cash amounts that have been deposited with the Payment
Agent pursuant to Section 1.11(a) hereof, and any and all interest thereon or
other income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the holders of Company
Stock Certificates or Company Warrants pursuant to Section 1.11(b) hereof, and
thereafter the holders of Company Stock Certificates or Company Warrants shall
be entitled to look only to Parent and only as general creditors thereof with
respect to any and all cash amounts that may be payable to such holders of
Company Stock Certificates or Company Warrants pursuant to Section 1.11(b)
hereof upon the due surrender of such Company Stock Certificates or Company
Warrants and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and other required documents
in the manner set forth in Section 1.11(b) hereof. No interest shall be
payable for the cash amounts delivered to Parent pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 1.11(e) and which are subsequently delivered to the holders of
Company Stock Certificates or Company Warrants.

  

  

(f) No Liability or Obligation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 1.11, neither Parent, the Payment Agent, the Surviving
Corporation, nor any party hereto shall be liable or have any other obligation
in respect of any Aggregate Consideration and any other amounts payable under
this Article I for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law pursuant to its
withholding rights set forth in Section 1.14.

  

  

1.12 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. The cash amounts
paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article I.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

1.13 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Company Stock
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount, if
any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof; provided, however,
that Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates to provide an indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent or the Payment Agent with respect to any claims arising
from the Company Stock Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

  

  

1.14 Withholding Taxes. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent and the
Payment Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent or the Payment
Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to any Company Holder or other
Person entitled to receive consideration or payments pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent or the Payment Agent and are paid to the
applicable Tax Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Holder
or other Person entitled to receive consideration pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent or the Payment Agent. Parent and Merger
Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Stockholder's Agent
prior to withholding any such amounts, other than amounts payable to the
Company Optionholders.

  

  

1.15 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and such other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) imposed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), if any, shall be borne and paid
one half by the Company Holders and one half by Parent.

  

  

1.16 Taking of Necessary Actions; Further Actions. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors of Parent,
the Company and the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of
their respective entities or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful
and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this
Agreement.

  

  

1.17 Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article I to the
contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
subject to compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the outstanding
Company Common Stock (or common stock of Merger Sub, as applicable) shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason
of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction, the Aggregate Consideration and the consideration payable
to the Company Holders as set forth in Section 1.7(a) and 1.8(d), to the
Company Optionholders as set forth in Section 1.8(a)(ii), and

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

   
 

to holders of Company Restricted Stock Awards as set forth in Section 1.8(b)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction. The costs of preparing and filing such returns shall be
borne and paid one half by the Company Holders and one half by Parent.

  

  

1.18 Post-Closing Adjustment.

  

  

(a) At the Closing, without any act of any Company Holder, Parent shall
deliver the Adjustment Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent on behalf of the
Company Holders to be governed by the terms set forth in this Agreement and
the Adjustment Escrow Agreement. The portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
initially contributed on behalf of each Company Holder shall be equal to such
Company Holder's Adjustment Escrow Contribution as set forth in the Final
Allocation Certificate.

  

  

(b) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Agent a proposed statement of the Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Cash of the Company as of
the Effective Time (the "Proposed Final Statement"). The Proposed Final
Statement shall include all of the balance sheet line items included in the
computation of Estimated Net Working Capital and shall include a computation
of Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Cash. The Proposed
Final Statement shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including the procedures set forth in the definition of "Net
Working Capital". Following the Closing, Parent shall provide the Stockholder
Agent and its representatives reasonable access at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice to the records, properties, personnel and (subject to the
execution of customary work paper access letters if requested) auditors
relating to the preparation of the Proposed Final Statement and shall cause
its personnel to reasonably cooperate with the Stockholder Agent in connection
with its review of the Proposed Final Statement.

  

  

(c) The Stockholder Agent shall notify Parent in writing (the "Notice of
Disagreement") prior to the expiration of the thirty-day (30) period
immediately following delivery of the Proposed Final Statement (the "Proposed
Final Statement Review Period") if the Stockholder Agent disagrees with the
calculations set forth in the Proposed Final Statement; provided that any
disagreement shall be only on the basis that the Proposed Final Statement (or
any amounts or items reflected thereon) does not reflect, or has not been
prepared in a manner consistent with, the provisions of this Agreement,
including the definitions contained herein, or otherwise contains a
mathematical error. The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such dispute, the amounts involved and the Stockholder
Agent's determination of the amount of the Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness or Closing Cash, as applicable, of the Company as of the
Effective Time. If no Notice of Disagreement is given to Parent prior to the
expiration of the Proposed Final Statement Review Period, then the Proposed
Final Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Stockholder Agent
and shall become final, binding and conclusive upon the parties and Parent and
the Stockholder Agent shall send a Joint Release Instruction (as defined in
the Adjustment Escrow Agreement) to the Escrow Agent.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(d) If a Notice of Disagreement is given to Parent prior to the expiration of
the Proposed Final Statement Review Period, then the Stockholder Agent and
Parent shall meet within fifteen (15) days of delivery of such Notice of
Disagreement to attempt, in good faith, to resolve any differences that they
may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement.
If Parent and Stockholder Agent come to a resolution with respect to the

(e) If the Stockholder Agent and Parent have been unable to resolve all of the
differences they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice
of Disagreement within fifteen (15) days of the delivery of the Notice of
Disagreement, either the Stockholder Agent or Parent may submit all matters
that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of Disagreement (along with
a copy of the Proposed Final Statement marked to indicate those line items
that are not in dispute) to a nationally recognized and independent accounting
firm selected by Parent subject to the approval of the Stockholder Agent (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or denied) (the "Accounting
Firm"), who will act as an expert, and not as an arbitrator; provided,
however, that in resolving any dispute, the Accounting Firm may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
Parent or the Stockholder Agent or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either Parent or the Stockholder Agent. Each party agrees to
execute a reasonable engagement letter if requested by the Accounting Firm.
During the review by the Accounting Firm, Parent and the Stockholder Agent
will make available to the Accounting Firm such information and access to such
facilities and employees as may be reasonably required by the Accounting Firm
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.18.

  

  

(f) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be
limited to mathematical errors and whether the disputed matters were
determined in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, including the
definitions contained herein. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to make
a final determination, binding on the parties to this Agreement, of the
appropriate amount of each of the line items in the Proposed Final Statement
as to which the Stockholder Agent and Parent disagree as set out in the Notice
of Disagreement, within thirty (30) days after the submission of matters in
dispute to the Accounting Firm, or as soon as practicable thereafter. Such
determination shall be in accordance with the standards set forth in this
Section 1.18(f) and shall be final, binding and conclusive with respect to any
issue relating to Parent's compliance with the standards set forth in this
Section 1.18(f) in preparing the Proposed Final Statement. The determination
of the Accounting Firm, and this agreement to submit the those matters that
remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of Disagreement to the Accounting
Firm, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Article 76 of the
New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.

  

  

(g) The determination of the Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and
Closing Cash of the Company, as determined either through the expiration of
the Proposed Final Statement Review Period without a Notice of Disagreement
delivered to Parent, through an agreement of Parent and the Stockholder Agent
or through the action of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 1.18(g),
shall be final, binding and conclusive on the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

   
 

parties, and shall be referred to as the "Final Statement," and the "Final Net
Working Capital," "Final Closing Indebtedness" and "Final Closing Cash,"
respectively.

  

  

(h) Final Payments.

  

  

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Net Adjustment Amount" means an
amount, which may be positive or negative, as the case may be, equal to (A)
the Final Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this Section
1.18 minus the Estimated Net Working Capital, plus (B) the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness minus the Final Closing Indebtedness as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 1.18, plus (C) the Final Closing Cash as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 1.18 minus the Estimated Closing Cash.

  

  

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is a negative value (in which case, the "Net
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this Section 1.18(h)(ii) shall be deemed to
be equal to the absolute value of such amount):

  

  

(A) and is in excess of the Adjustment Escrow Amount, Parent and the
Stockholder Agent shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent under the
Adjustment Escrow Agreement to deliver to an account designated by Parent, the
amount held in the Adjustment Escrow Fund and the amount by which the Net
Adjustment Amount exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount that can be recovered
by Parent pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(iv); or

  

  

(B) and is less than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, Parent and the Stockholder
Agent shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent under the Adjustment Escrow
Agreement to deliver (x) to an account designated by Parent, the amount of the
Net Adjustment Amount and (y) to the Payment Agent for distribution to the
Company Holders (other than holders of Dissenting Shares), an amount equal to
the Adjustment Escrow Amount minus the Net Adjustment Amount; it being
understood that the Payment Agent will make such distribution under clause (y)
above in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to each such Company Holder
based on his, her or its respective Pro-Rata Portion.

  

  

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is a positive value or equal to zero, (A)
Parent and the Stockholder Agent shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent
under the Adjustment Escrow Agreement to deliver to the Payment Agent for
distribution to the Company Holders (other than holders of Dissenting Shares),
an amount equal to the Adjustment Escrow Amount, and (B) Parent shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Payment Agent for distribution to the Company Holders
(other than holders of Dissenting Shares), an amount in cash equal to the Net
Adjustment Amount (provided that the Net Adjustment Amount is a positive
value); it being understood that the Payment Agent will make the distributions
under clauses (A) and (B) above in accordance with the Adjustment Escrow
Agreement to each such Company Holder based on his, her or its respective Pro-
Rata Portion.

  

  

(iv) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be in borne by Parent
and the Company Holders, acting through the Stockholder Agent, in inverse

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

   
 

proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the Accounting Firm,
which proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based
on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be
determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm
is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. If not paid by the
Stockholder Agent (on behalf of the Company Holders), Parent may, at its sole
and absolute option, claim the amount of the costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm payable by the Company Holders from the Adjustment Escrow
Fund. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts to be paid to Parent from the
Adjustment Escrow Fund or Indemnification Escrow Fund pursuant to Section
1.18(h)(ii)(A) shall not be subject to any limitations, caps or baskets in
this Agreement, including, without limitation, as provided in Article VII.

28  

  

 

 

 

   
 

the Books and Records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (which

(d) Section 2.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of all Indebtedness of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. No Indebtedness of the Company

any of such Indebtedness, (ii) the incurrence of Indebtedness by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, or (iii) the ability of the Company or any Company

balance sheet arrangements to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or otherwise involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  

  

2.10 Absence of Changes.

(c) Since June 30, 2016, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor
any Person acting on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, nor any
of their respective Affiliates has taken, or omitted to take, in each case,
any action that, if taken, or omitted to be taken, after the date of this
Agreement, would constitute a breach of Sections 4.1(a), (b), (f), (g), (i),
(j), (k), (q), (u), (x), (y) or (z).

  

  

2.11 Taxes.

appropriate Tax Authority all income and other material Tax Returns required
to be filed. All such Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material
respects. All Taxes due and owing by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) have been timely paid. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is currently the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return (other than customary
extensions for which no approval is required), nor has any such extension been
requested. No

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

   
 

claim has ever been made in writing by a Tax Authority in a jurisdiction where
the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that it is or
may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

  

  

(b) Any unpaid Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary do not, as of
the date of the Interim Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax
liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
balance sheets (rather than in any notes thereto) contained in the Interim
Financial Statements. Since the date of the Interim Financial Statements,

Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise inconsistent with
past custom and practice, except as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) No deficiencies for Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary have
been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing by any Tax Authority. There are
no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened audits, assessments
or other actions for or relating to any liability in respect of Taxes of the
Company (or any Company Subsidiary), and there are no matters under discussion
between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any Tax Authority or
otherwise known to the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to
Taxes, that are likely to result in an additional Liability for Taxes with
respect to the Company (or any Company Subsidiary). The Company has delivered
or made available to Parent complete and accurate copies of all income and
other material Tax Returns of the Company and each Company Subsidiary for all
taxable years remaining open under the applicable statute of limitations and
complete and accurate copies of all examination reports and statements of
deficiencies issued to the Company or any Company Subsidiary for such taxable
years. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has waived any statute
of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, nor has any request been made in
writing for any such extension or waiver. No power of attorney with respect to
any Taxes of the Company has been executed or filed with any Tax Authority.

  

  

(d) There are no Liens for Taxes on any assets of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable.

(f) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability for any
Taxes of any other Person (i) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee or
successor, (iii) by contract (other than any customary contracts or
arrangements that are not outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise
inconsistent with past custom and practice and the primary purpose of which do
not relate to Tax), or (iv) otherwise. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has ever been a member of any consolidated, combined, affiliated,
aggregate or unitary group of persons for any Tax purpose other than a group
of which the Company is the parent.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(g) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has withheld and timely paid all
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or
other third party.

  

  

(h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will be required to include
any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income
for any taxable period (or any portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date
as a result of any installment sale, open transaction or similar disposition
or accounting method change pursuant to Section 481 of the Code or any similar
provision of the Code or the corresponding Tax Laws of any nation, state or

transaction identified as a "listed transaction" for purposes of Treasury
Regulations §§ 1.6011-4(b)(2) or 301.6111-2(b)(2). If the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has entered into any transaction such that, if the
treatment claimed by it were to be disallowed, the transaction would
constitute a substantial understatement of federal income tax within the
meaning of the Code Section 6662, then it believes that it has either (x)
substantial authority for the tax treatment of such transaction or (y)
disclosed on its Tax Return the relevant facts affecting the tax treatment of
such transaction.

  

  

(k) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been a United States
real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of

prior to the date of this Agreement or (B) in a distribution which could

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has conducted its business in
material compliance with all Laws and Orders applicable to the operation and
conduct of its business or any of its Assets and Properties. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received written notice of any
violation or alleged violation of any such Laws or Orders. No event has
occurred, and no condition exists, that would reasonably be expected to (with
or without the lapse of time) constitute or result directly or indirectly in a
material violation by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any Law, Order
or Permit relating to the conduct of its business, or any of its Assets and
Properties.

  

  

(b) No accumulation or use of corporate funds of the Company or any Company

any Representative thereof or any other Person acting for or on behalf of the
Company or such Company Subsidiary has, directly or indirectly, engaged in any
activity that would constitute an illegal contribution, gift, bribe, rebate,

public, regardless of form, whether in money, property or services, (i) to
obtain favorable treatment for the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any
Affiliate thereof in securing business, (ii) to pay for favorable treatment

plans relating to real property). Neither the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any Representative acting on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, has used or is using funds for unlawful contributions,

Subsidiaries do business. The Company and each Company Subsidiary have in
place adequate controls and systems to reasonably ensure compliance with
applicable Laws pertaining to anticorruption, including but not limited to the
FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, in each of the jurisdiction in which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary currently does or in the past has done
business, either directly or indirectly. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is aware of any event, fact or circumstance that has occurred or
exists that is reasonably likely to result in a finding of noncompliance with
any applicable anticorruption Law. No employee, officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been the subject of any investigation,
inquiry, allegations, or proceedings by any government entity or any customer
regarding actual or alleged violations of any applicable anticorruption Laws.
No such investigation, inquiry or Action or Proceeding is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there are no circumstances which are likely to give rise to any such
investigation, inquiry, allegations, or Action or Proceeding.

  

  

(c) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is in possession of all material
authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates, approvals and clearances of
any Governmental or Regulatory Authority necessary for the Company and each
Company Subsidiary to own, lease and operate their respective properties or to
conduct its business consistent with past practice (collectively, the
"Permits"). All applications for or renewals of all such Permits have been
timely filed and made and no such Permit will expire or be terminated as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
All of such Permits are in full force and effect and will remain in full force
and effect immediately following the Closing, and the Company is in material
compliance with the foregoing without any conflict with the valid rights of
others.

the United States in which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries do or in
the past have done business, directly or indirectly (collectively, the "Trade
Control Laws"). The Company and each Company Subsidiary have in place adequate
controls and systems to reasonably ensure compliance with applicable Trade
Control Laws. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is aware
of any event, fact or circumstance that has occurred or exists that is
reasonably likely to result in a finding of material noncompliance with any

(e) There are no inquiries and investigations pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority with respect to the Trade Control Laws.
The Company and each Company Subsidiary has never been subject to any such

disclosure (voluntary or otherwise) to any Governmental or Regulatory
Authority with respect to any violation, potential violation, or liability
arising under or relating to any Trade Control Laws.

  

  

(f) Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any directors,

Kingdom anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations.

against the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to such anti-money
laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations. The Company or the
Company Subsidiaries have in place adequate controls and systems to reasonably
ensure compliance in all material aspects with applicable Laws pertaining to
anti-money laundering and economic sanctions in each of the jurisdictions in
which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries currently do or in the past
have done business. None of (i) the consummation of the Merger, (ii) the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, or (iii) the consummation of any transaction contemplated hereby or
thereby, or the fulfillment of the terms hereof or thereof, will result in a
violation by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any of the OFAC
Sanctions or of any applicable economic sanctions or anti-money laundering
laws of the United States, the United Kingdom or any other applicable
jurisdiction.

  

  

(g) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is and has been in compliance with
all terms and conditions of each Contract with any branch, division, agency or
entity that is part of the United States or any state or local government, or
any foreign government entity, agency, or instrumentality, including state-

2.14 Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.

  

  

(a) Section 2.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each Plan.
True, correct and complete copies of the following documents with respect to

any Identified Employee.

  

  

(b) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has ever maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or had an
obligation to maintain, sponsor or contribute to, or has any Liability under
or with respect to (i) a "defined benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(35)
of ERISA, (ii) a pension plan subject to the minimum funding standards of
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (iii) a "multiemployer plan,"
as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, (iv) any "multiple employer plan"
(within the meaning of Section 413 of the Code), (v) any "voluntary employees'
beneficiary association" (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code), (vi) any organization or trust described in Sections 501(c)(17) or
501(c)(20) of the Code or (vii) any "welfare benefits fund" described in
Section 419(e) of the Code (or, in each case, any similar non-U.S.
equivalents). No other trade or business is treated, together with the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates,
as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA
and none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Liability to or with respect to an
arrangement listed in (i) through (vii) above (other than with respect to

None of the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has incurred or is contingently liable for any withdrawal liability
to any "multiemployer plan" under Section 4021 of ERISA.

  

  

(c) Each Plan has been maintained, in all material respects, in accordance
with its terms and with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable
federal and state laws. Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, any "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to the
Plans has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code or Sections 406 or 407 of ERISA that is not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA but which would reasonably be

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

   
 

expected to result in material liability. Except as would not result in any
material liability to the Company, no fiduciary has any liability for breach
of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the
administration or investment of the assets of any Plan.

  

  

(d) The Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code have received
a favorable determination or approval letter from the IRS with respect to such
qualification, or may rely on an opinion letter issued by the IRS with respect
to a prototype plan adopted in accordance with the requirements for such
reliance, or have time remaining for application to the IRS for a
determination of the qualified status of such Plan for any period for which
such Plan would not otherwise be covered by an IRS determination, and nothing
has occurred with respect to the operation of the Plans which could reasonably
be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption.

  

  

(e) There are no pending actions, claims, audits, investigations by any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority or lawsuits which have been asserted in
writing or instituted against the Plans, the assets of any of the trusts under
such plans or the plan sponsor or the plan administrator, or against any
fiduciary of the Plans with respect to the operation of such plans (other than
routine benefit claims), nor does the Company have knowledge of facts which
could reasonably be expected to form the basis for any such claim or lawsuit.

  

  

(f) Each Plan, and any award thereunder, that is or forms part of a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code is in documentary compliance in all material respects with, and
the Company and each Company Subsidiary has, since January 1, 2009, complied
in practice and operation with, all applicable requirements of Section 409A of
the Code.

  

  

(g) Except as set forth on Section 2.14(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of the Agreement, nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (whether alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or further acts or events) (i) result in any
payment becoming due to any current or former employee, director or
independent contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or satisfy any
prerequisite (whether exclusive or non-exclusive) to any payment or benefit to
any current or former employee, director or independent contractor of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) increase any benefits under any Plan,
(iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of
any such benefits under any Plan, or (iv) result in the forgiveness of any
Indebtedness of any current or former employee, director or independent
contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except as set forth on
Section 2.14(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is a party to any Contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement covering any current or former employees or directors thereof
that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the imposition of any
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or the payment of any amount that
would be non-deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code. There is no
Contract by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound to compensate
any current or former officer, employee or director of the Company or any
Subsidiary for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 or Section 409A of
the Code. The Company has provided Parent with a report (x) setting forth its
calculations performed in accordance with Section 280G of the Code with
respect to each service provider of the Company who is a "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code),

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

including all worksheets relating to the calculations, and (y) which
identifies any potential payments which would be treated as "excess parachute
payments" (as defined in Section 280G(b) of the Code) with respect to each
such individual, in each case, as of the date hereof.

  

  

(h) Except as set forth on Section 2.14(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
none of the Plans provide for post-employment life or health coverage for any
participant or any beneficiary of a participant, except as may be required by
COBRA or at the expense of the participant or participant's beneficiary.

  

  

(i) With respect to each Plan that is maintained for the benefit of any
employee or service provider (or former employee or service provider) who
performs services outside the United States (each, a "Foreign Plan"): (i) all
employer and employee contributions to each Foreign Plan required by law or by
the terms of such plan (including contributions to all mandatory fund schemes)
have been made or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with generally
accepted accounting practices in the applicable jurisdiction applied to such

contemplated to be conducted) will not infringe, dilute, misappropriate or
otherwise violate, the Intellectual Property or other rights of any Person;
provided that the foregoing representation shall be limited to the Company's
knowledge with respect to Patents. There is no Claim, Action or Proceeding

knowledge, any other Person.

provided to Parent that (i) assigns to the Company or any Company Subsidiary

and except as otherwise required by applicable Law (including federal and
state securities Laws) in which case the Company shall provide notice to
Parent reasonably in advance of such disclosure, the Company shall not issue
or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement or
disclosure to any third party of the existence or any subject matter relating

action or agree to any other limitation or restriction, or agree to be subject
to any other contractual limitations or restraints with respect to Parent's

as promptly as practicable of (a) any event which would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (b) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is

this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior
to the Effective Time and (c) any failure of the Company to comply with or
satisfy any covenant hereunder, in the case of (b) and (c), solely to the

practicable of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any representation or
warranty of Parent in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) any failure of Parent to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder. In no event shall the delivery of any notice pursuant to this

effect of satisfying any condition set forth in Article VI.

the other party, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do and
perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary for
effecting completely the consummation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the conditions set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, where the
satisfaction of such conditions depends on action or forbearance from action
by such party.

  

  

5.10 Third Party Consents. Between the date hereof and the Closing, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek to obtain (i) the
consents (and deliver the applicable notices) specifically set forth on or

Section 2.6(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule had such consent
requirement been in existence as of the date hereof.

  

  

5.11 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, the
Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of any
such Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

5.12 Intellectual Property. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice if any
Person prior to the Closing Date (or the earlier valid termination of this
Agreement), (a)(i) commenced, or shall have provided written notice to Parent,
the Company or any of its directors, officers or principal shareholders that
it intends to commence, an Action or Proceeding alleging that, or (ii) shall
have provided written notice to the Company or any of its directors, officers
or principal shareholders alleging that, in each case (x) any of the
Intellectual Property presently

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

   
 

embodied, or proposed to be embodied, in any of the Company Products or
utilized in the Company's business infringes, dilutes, misappropriates or
otherwise violates the Intellectual Property of such Person, (y) any such
Intellectual Property is available for licensing from a putative or potential
licensor providing the notice, or (z) otherwise alleges that the Company does
not own or have the right to exploit such Intellectual Property or Company
Products. Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (or the
earlier valid termination of this Agreement), the Company shall take
commercially reasonable actions (A) to maintain, perfect, preserve or renew
the Intellectual Property required to be set forth in Section 2.19(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (including any such Intellectual Property created
or acquired between the Effective Time and the Closing Date), including the
payment of any registration, maintenance, renewal fees, annuity fees and Taxes
or the filing of any documents applications or certificates related thereto,
and (B) to promptly respond and prepare to respond to all requests, related to
any such Intellectual Property, received from any Governmental Authority.

  


 

  

5.13 Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Parent, solely in its
capacity as a stockholder, shall direct the Surviving Corporation, to the
extent provided under the Company's Charter Documents or those indemnification
agreements with the members of the Company Board as set forth on Schedule
5.13(a), to indemnify the current or former directors and officers of the
Company currently indemnified under the Charter Documents of the Company
(collectively, the "Covered Persons") against all Losses arising from any
Action or Proceeding based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in
part out of the fact that such Person is or was an officer or director of the
Company, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or
omissions occurring, at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, or at or after, the Closing (excluding matters, acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the same extent that
such Persons are indemnified as of the date hereof by the Company. For a
period of six (6) years following the Closing, the Charter Documents of the
Company will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and
indemnification of Covered Persons with respect to periods ending on or before
the Closing Date that are at least as favorable to the Covered Persons as
those contained in the Charter Documents of the Company, or in the event that
the Company is merged or consolidated with Parent or an Affiliate of Parent,
the Charter Documents of Parent (with respect to current or former directors
and officers), in each case, as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights of the Covered Persons thereunder.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain and fully pay for "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amount and containing terms
and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of
the Company as the Company's existing policies with respect to claims arising
out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time
(including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
(the "DandO Tail Policy"). The Company shall bear the cost of the DandO Tail
Policy, and such costs, to the extent not paid prior to the Closing, shall be
included in the determination of Company Transaction Expenses. During the term
of the DandO Tail Policy, Parent shall not (and

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

   
 

shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) take any action following the
Closing to cause the DandO Tail Policy to be cancelled or any provision therein
to be amended or waived; provided, that neither Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor any Affiliate thereof shall be obligated to pay any premiums
or other amounts in respect of such DandO Tail Policy. Any amounts payable under
this Section 5.13(b) shall be Company Transaction Expenses, net of any
recovery under the DandO Tail Policy (and the costs of securing such recovery).

  

  

5.14 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Filing of Pre-Closing Tax Returns After the Closing Date. Subject to
Section 5.14(h), Parent shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that are required to be filed after
the Closing Date. Parent shall prepare such Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with applicable past practice to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, shall
deliver such Tax Returns at least fourteen (14) days prior to the due date
(taking into account any extension) for the filing of such Tax Returns to
Stockholder Agent for its review and comment, and shall incorporate all of the
Stockholder Agent's reasonable comments.

  

  

(b) Filing of Straddle Period Tax Returns. Subject to Section 5.14(h), Parent
shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, any
Tax Return of the Company and each Company Subsidiary for a Straddle Period.
Parent shall prepare such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with applicable
past practice to the extent permitted by applicable Law and shall deliver such
Tax Returns at least fourteen (14) days prior to the due date (taking into
account any extension) for the filing of such Tax Return to Stockholder Agent
for its review and comment and shall incorporate all of the Stockholder
Agent's reasonable comments.

  

  

(c) Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes. With respect to Taxes of the Company
and each Company Subsidiary relating to a Straddle Period, Company Holders
shall be severally and not jointly liable for the amount of such Taxes
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period that is deemed to end on the
close of business, Eastern Time, on the Closing Date. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that
relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (i)
in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or
receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based
upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which
would by payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.

  

  

(d) Cooperation. Company Holders, the Stockholder Agent and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective affiliates, officers,
employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns and conducting any Tax Matter, including
maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in
connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to
all taxable periods relating to Taxes.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Tax Contests.

  

  

(i) Parent, on the one hand, and Stockholder Agent and Company Holders, on the
other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon receipt by such party of
written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events
with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle
Period for which Company Holders may be liable under this Agreement (any such
inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a "Tax Matter").

  

  

(ii) Parent shall have control of the conduct of all Tax Matters. The
Stockholder Agent may fully participate at its own expense (on behalf of the
Company Holders) with respect to any Tax Matter, Parent shall keep the
Stockholder Agent informed of all material developments on a timely basis and
Parent shall not resolve such Tax Matter in a manner that could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse impact (except for any de minimis amounts) on the
indemnifying parties' indemnification obligations under this Agreement without
the Stockholder Agent's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(iii) In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this
Section 5.14(e) and Article VII, the provisions of this Section 5.14(e) shall
govern.

  

  

(f) Transfer Tax Returns. Parent, on the one hand, and Stockholder Agent and
Company Holders, on the other hand, shall cooperate in the preparation and
filing of any Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes, and join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation, as applicable. Any
Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared and filed by the party primarily or customarily responsible under
applicable Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party will use its
reasonable best efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other party for
review and comments at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date such Tax
Returns are due to be filed. The costs of preparing and filing such returns
shall be borne and paid one half by the Company Holders and one half by
Parent.

  

  

(g) Any amounts payable under this Section 5.14 or Article VII shall be
treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Aggregate Consideration for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

  

(h) Post-Closing Actions. Parent and the Surviving Company shall not amend any
Tax Return of the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, make,
change or revoke any Tax election with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods,
initiate discussions or examinations with Tax Authorities regarding Taxes with
respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, make any voluntary disclosures with
respect to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or file any Tax Returns for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period in a jurisdiction within which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has not previously filed Tax Returns, or take any similar
action with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period after the Closing, in each
case, without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Agent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to the extent any such
amendment or action would adversely affect the Company Holders;

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

   
 

provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, none of Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their Affiliates shall be prohibited from taking any Tax
position with respect to a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date
that is inconsistent with any Tax position taken by, or any Tax Return of, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
a Straddle Period.

  

  

(i) Tax Refunds. Any Tax refunds of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that
are received by Parent or the Surviving Company and any amounts credited
against any Tax of Parent or the Surviving Company, to which Parent or the
Surviving Company becomes entitled that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of
the Company (excluding the carryback of net-operating losses from a taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period and any Tax refunds or credits reflected as an asset in the Final
Statement), shall be for the account of the Company Holders in accordance with
their respective Pro-Rata Portions. Parent shall, at its option, (A) promptly
pay, or cause to be paid, over to the Stockholder Agent (for the account of
the Company Holders) any such refunds or amounts of any such credit, net of
related fees or expenses incurred by Parent or the Surviving Company in
obtaining such refund or credit (with such refunds or amounts to be promptly
deposited in the Stockholder Agent Fund) or (B) deposit such amounts in an
escrow account, which shall (X) be maintained pursuant to terms and conditions
substantially similar to those set forth in the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement (but the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to minimize any
fees with respect thereto), (Y) provide Parent with a source of funds for
satisfaction of any unpaid claims arising under Section 7.2(a)(ix) and (Z) be
released to the Company Holders pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 7.3(c), provided, that the "Release Date" for purposes of this clause
(Z) shall be the date that is thirty (30) days after the statute of
limitations with respect to such Tax refund or credit expires. To the extent
any such Tax refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or reduced, Parent
shall be permitted to recoup such amount, together with any interest,
penalties or charges imposed thereon by an applicable Tax Authority, from the
Company Holders only after the escrow account, if applicable, described in the
immediately preceding sentence has been fully depleted.

  

  

5.15 Company Stock Plan. Prior to the Effective Time and subject to the review
and approval of Parent, the Company shall take any and all actions necessary
to authorize and implement the transactions set forth in Section 1.8.

  

  

5.16 Termination of Certain Plans. No later than later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with executed
resolutions of the Company Board authorizing the termination of the Company
Stock Plan, effective as of the Effective Time. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent.

  

  

5.17 280G Approval.

  

  

(a) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, and no later than
seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide
Parent with an updated report (x) setting forth its calculations performed in
accordance with Section 280G of the Code with respect to each service provider
of the Company who is a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section
280G(c) of the Code), including all worksheets relating to the calculations,

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

   
 

and (y) which identifies any potential payments which would be treated as
"excess parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G(b) of the Code) with
respect to each such individual as of such date.

  

  

(b) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, with respect to each
service provider of the Company who is a "disqualified individual" (as defined
in Section 280G(c) of the Code), the Company will use its best efforts to seek
to have any such individual waive any payments or economic benefit that such
individual is entitled in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
that could constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b) of the Code) with respect to such individual. The Company shall, no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, submit to the
holders of Company Capital Stock for approval (in a manner satisfactory to
Parent), by such number of holders of Company Capital Stock as is required by
the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments or benefits that
may separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" pursuant
to Section 280G of the Code ("Section 280G Payments") (which determination
shall be made by the Company and shall be subject to reasonable review and
approval by Parent) that were waived pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 5.17(b), such that, if approved, such payments and benefits shall not
be deemed to be subject to the penalties of Section 280G of the Code, and
prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent notification and
evidence satisfactory to Parent that (i) a vote of the holders of Company
Capital Stock was solicited in conformance with Section 280G and the
regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite stockholder approval was
obtained with respect to any payments or benefits that were subject to the
stockholder vote (the "280G Stockholder Approval"), or (ii) that the 280G
Stockholder Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that such payments
or benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent they would cause such
amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to waivers of those
payments or benefits, which were executed by the disqualified individuals
prior to the vote of the holders of Company Capital Stock pursuant to this
Section 5.17(b).

  

  

5.18 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) For a period commencing upon the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of
(x) December 31 of the year in which the Closing Date occurs and (y) the date
that is three (3) months following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide each employee
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who is employed by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing Date (each a "Continuing
Employee") with a base salary or hourly wage rate and incentive opportunities
(other than with respect to any equity or equity-based incentive
opportunities) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those
applicable to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date.

  

  

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parent's or the
Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide each
Continuing Employee with full credit for such Continuing Employee's service
with the Company or any Company Subsidiary for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, benefit accruals and determination of the level of benefits
(including, for purposes of vacation, severance and retirement benefits, but
not for purpose of benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan)
under any benefit plan

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

   
 

sponsored or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate on or following the Closing Date (each, a "Parent Plan") to the
same extent recognized by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits. In addition, Parent shall take such actions as are contemplated
in Schedule 5.18(b).

  

  

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parent's or the
Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries, as applicable, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations
otherwise applicable to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents
under any Parent Plan that provides health benefits in which Continuing
Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing Date, other
than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees as of
the Closing Date under the analogous Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-
payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date during the portion of the calendar year
prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-
of-pocket maximums under Parent Plans that are health plans in which they are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date in the same plan year in which
such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred and
(iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability
requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Continuing Employee and
his or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing Date, in each case to
the extent such Continuing Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Plan prior to the Closing
Date.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no provision of
this Agreement is intended to, or does, require the Parent to keep any Person
employed for any period of time or constitute the establishment or adoption
of, or amendment to, any Plan. The provisions of this Section 5.18 are solely
for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in
this Section 5.18, express or implied, shall confer upon any employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or legal representative or beneficiary
thereof or any other Person, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation
or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or a right
in any employee or beneficiary of such employee or other Person under a Plan
that such employee or beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise have
under the terms of that Plan.

Company or relating to events or conduct occurring at or prior to the Closing.

  

  

(b) Limitations. The indemnification obligations under this Agreement are
subject to the following limitations:

  

  

(i) No Company Holder shall be obligated to indemnify any Parent Indemnitee
for any claim (or series of related claims arising from substantially the same
or related underlying facts, events or circumstances) for indemnification
pursuant to a Representation Claim unless and until the aggregate amount of
all Losses equal or exceed Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($600,000) (the
"Threshold"), at which time the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to
receive (subject to the other provisions set forth in this Article VII) the
full amount of all Losses from and including the first dollar of all such
Losses;

  

  

(ii) No Company Holder shall be obligated to indemnify any Parent Indemnitee
for any claim (or series of related claims arising from substantially the same
or related underlying facts, events or circumstances) for indemnification
pursuant to a Representation Claim unless and until such claim (or series of
related claims arising from substantially the same or related underlying
facts, events or circumstances) involves Losses in excess, individually or in
the aggregate with respect to multiple breaches of the same representation and
warranty, Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the "De Minimis Amount");

  

  

(iii) Subject to Section 7.2(c), the Threshold and De Minimis Amount shall not
apply to Losses arising from (x) a breach of a Fundamental Representation or
(y) any claims other than Representation Claims (for clarity, the obligations
set forth in Section 7.2(a)(ii) through (x) inclusive are not subject to the
Threshold or De Minimis Amount);

  

  

(iv) Subject to Section 7.2(c), each Company Holder, in its capacity as such,
shall not have any liability pursuant to a Representation Claim, in the
aggregate, in excess of such Company Holder's Indemnification Escrow
Contribution, and with respect to any such recovery of Losses therefrom, the
Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive recourse, except
for a Representation Claim regarding (x) any Fundamental Representation, in
which case the limit on each Company Holder's liability shall be such Company
Holder's Pro-Rata Portion of the Aggregate Consideration, or (y) any IP Claim,
in

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

   
 

which case the limit on each Company Holder's liability shall be such Company
Holder's Pro-Rata Portion of Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) which shall
not be limited to the Indemnification Escrow Fund (for the avoidance of doubt,
each Company Holder's obligations in respect of the Pre-Closing Tax Indemnity
shall not be limited to the Indemnification Escrow Fund);

  

  

(v) Subject to Section 7.2(c), each Company Holder, in its capacity as such,
shall not have any liability to the Parent Indemnitees under this Agreement,
including for any Covenant Claim or any of the matters set forth in Sections
7.2(a)(iii) through (x), in excess of such Company Holder's Pro-Rata Portion
of the Aggregate Consideration;

  

  

(vi) Nothing in this Section 7.2(b) shall limit Parent's or the Surviving
Corporation's right to seek equitable relief (including an injunction) to
enforce any rights under this Agreement;

  

  

(vii) Each Parent Indemnitee acknowledges and agrees that, for purposes
hereof, Losses shall be calculated based on the amount of Loss that remains
after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds actually received and any
other third party (other than the Company Holders or the Stockholder Agent)
payment actually received by a Parent Indemnitee with respect thereto and, in
the event a Parent Indemnitee receives any such insurance proceeds subsequent
to an indemnification payment by the Company Holders then such Parent
Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Company Holders for any payment made
or expense incurred by the Parent Indemnitee in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Parent Indemnitee,
net of any expenses incurred by the Parent Indemnitee in collecting such
amounts;

  

  

(viii) No Company Holder shall have any indemnification obligations pursuant
to this Article VII for any Losses arising out of a breach of or inaccuracy of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement (and the amount of any Losses incurred in respect of such breach or
inaccuracy shall not be included in the calculation of any limitations on
indemnification set forth herein) relating to any matter to the extent that
such matter was resolved in the determination of the Net Adjustment Amount for
purposes of determining adjustments to the Aggregate Consideration, such that
a Parent Indemnitee would have already been compensated for such Losses;

  

  

(ix) Any amounts payable to any Parent Indemnitee pursuant to the
indemnification obligations hereunder shall be paid without duplication, and
in no event shall any party be indemnified more than once in respect of the
same Losses suffered, whether or not claims may be made under different
provisions of this Agreement for the same Loss; and

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Article VII to the contrary, in the event
of any Fraud Claim, (x) the Parent Indemnitees shall have all remedies
available at law or in equity (including in tort) in connection with such
Fraud Claim and (y) the limitations set forth in this Section 7.2(b) shall not
apply to any Fraud Claim, provided that (a) in the case of fraud, willful
misconduct or Knowing and Intentional Breach by a Company Holder, there is no
limit on the damages that may be obtained from such Company Holder to the
extent that the damages arise from such fraud, willful misconduct or Knowing
and Intentional Breach, but the other

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

   
 

limitations set forth herein shall continue to apply with respect to all other
Company Holders; and (b) in the case of fraud, willful misconduct or Knowing
and Intentional Breach by the Company, there is no limit on the damages that
may be obtained from the Company Holders on a several and not joint basis to
the extent that the damages arise from such fraud, willful misconduct or
Knowing and Intentional Breach, but the other limitations set forth herein
shall continue to apply. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Section
7.2 or any other provisions in this Agreement, for the purposes of determining
the existence of a breach of this Agreement or calculating the amount of any
Losses attributable thereto, any qualifications to the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements with respect to materiality, including
for "material", "in all material respects", "Company Material Adverse Effect"
or similar qualifications shall be disregarded

  

  

(d) Any indemnification hereunder for Losses with respect to Taxes, including
the Pre-Closing Tax Indemnity, (i) shall be limited to Taxes attributable to
Pre-Closing Periods, except with respect to a breach of any representation or
warranty contained in Sections 2.11(e), (f), (h), (n) or (o), (ii) shall not
include any Losses with respect to Taxes that arise as a result of any breach
of Parent's obligations set forth in Section 5.14 and (iii) shall not include
any Losses with respect to Taxes that arise as a result of transactions
outside the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date after the Closing
(except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement).

  

  

(e) For purposes of this Article VII, all "Losses" shall be calculated net of
any Loss Tax Benefit available to the Parent Indemnitees that are attributable
to such Losses. For purposes of this Agreement, "Loss Tax Benefit" means any
refund of Taxes paid or net reduction in the amount of cash Taxes which
otherwise would have been paid, in each case computed on a "with and without"
basis, to the extent actually recognized in the taxable period in which the
applicable indemnifiable Losses are incurred or the immediately succeeding
taxable period. If a Parent Indemnitee shall have received the payment
required by this Agreement from a Company Holder and shall subsequently
recognize any Loss Tax Benefit arising from the incurrence or payment of such
Loss within the taxable periods described in the second sentence of this
Section 7.2(e), then such Parent Indemnitee shall promptly pay to such Company
Holder a sum equal to the amount of such Loss Tax Benefit, up to the aggregate
amount of any payments received from such Parent Indemnitee pursuant to this
Agreement in respect of such Loss. For clarity, nothing in this Section 7.2(d)
shall prohibit any Parent Indemnitee from submitting any claim arising under
Section 7.2(a) prior to the expiration of the taxable periods described in the
second sentence of this Section 7.2(d).

  

  

7.3 Indemnification Escrow Provisions.

  

  

(a) Establishment of the Indemnification Escrow Fund. At the Closing, without
any act of any Company Holder, Parent shall deliver the Indemnification Escrow
Amount to the Escrow Agent on behalf of the Company Holders to be governed by
the terms set forth in this Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement. The portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount initially
contributed on behalf of each Company Holder shall be equal to such Company
Holder's Indemnification Escrow Contribution as set forth in the Final
Allocation Certificate.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(b) Availability of Indemnification Escrow.

  

  

(i) Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations otherwise set forth in
this Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Indemnification
Escrow Fund shall be available to satisfy the Company Holders' obligations to
indemnify the Parent Indemnitees' Losses during the Indemnification Escrow
Period, pursuant to this Article VII.

  

  

(ii) Any indemnification of a Parent Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VII
shall be delivered to Parent from the Indemnification Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent
within five (5) days after the determination thereof; provided that a Parent
Indemnitee shall make a direct claim against the Company Holders, up to the
Aggregate Consideration only in the event that (i) such Parent Indemnitee is
entitled to recover Losses either greater than the Indemnification Escrow
Amount (or the amount remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund) or
following the Expiration Date pursuant to this Article VII and (ii) the
Indemnification Escrow Fund is no longer available, or is not sufficient,
within the applicable survival period to properly indemnify such Parent
Indemnitee in accordance with this Article VII.

  

  

(c) Indemnification Escrow Periods; Distribution of Escrow Fund upon
Termination of Indemnification Escrow Period. Subject to the following
requirements, the Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be in existence
immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 11:59 p.m.
Eastern Time on the Expiration Date (the period of time from the Effective
Time through and including date and termination of the Indemnification Escrow
Fund is referred to herein as the "Indemnification Escrow Period"). On the
first Business Day following the Expiration Date (the "Release Date"), the
Escrow Agent shall release to each Company Holder an amount in cash, if any,
equal to the product of (x) such Company Holder's Pro-Rata Portion, multiplied
by (y) the amount of cash remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund on the
Release Date, if any; provided, however, that an amount equal to the product
of (x) such Company Holder's Pro-Rata Portion, multiplied by (y) that portion
of the Indemnification Escrow Fund that is necessary in the good faith
judgment of Parent to satisfy any unsatisfied claims for Losses under this
Section 7.3 specified in any Claims Notice delivered to the Escrow Agent prior
to termination of the Indemnification Escrow Period with respect to such
Company Holder (the "Pending Amount") shall remain in the Indemnification
Escrow Fund until such claims have been resolved. As soon as all such claims,
if any, have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to such Company
Holders the remaining portion of the Pending Amount not required to satisfy
such claims.

  

  

(d) Third-Party Claims.

  

  

(i) In the event a Parent Indemnitee receives notice (or is otherwise made
aware) of any claim or demand (including the threat of such), or is served
with a complaint, counterclaim or cross-claim in litigation (a "Third Party
Claim") which Parent expects may result in a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Article VII (for itself and/or any Parent Indemnitees),
Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the time that Parent
is notified in writing of such Third Party Claim, give written notice to the
Stockholder

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

79  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Agent of such Third Party Claim, with a copy to the Escrow Agent (if such
Third Party Claim is received prior to the Expiration Date) (a "Claims
Notice"). Such Claims Notice shall specify to the extent practicable, based on
then-available information, the facts constituting the basis for, and a good
faith estimate of the amount of the potential Losses reasonably expected to be
incurred with respect to, the claim asserted; and the representation, warranty
or covenant under which the liability or obligation is asserted. The failure
of any Parent Indemnitee to give notice as provided in this Section 7.3(d)(i)
shall not relieve the Company Holders from any liability except to the extent
that the Company Holders are actually and materially prejudiced by the failure
or delay in giving such notice.

  

  

(ii) The Stockholder Agent, as representative for the Company Holders, may
elect, at the sole cost and expense of the Company Holders (provided that
prior to the termination of the Indemnification Escrow Period any such costs
and expenses of the Stockholder Agent shall not be paid out of the amounts in
the Indemnification Escrow Fund), to assume and control the defense of such
Third Party Claim. In the event the Stockholder Agent exercises such right to
assume the defense and control of a Third Party Claim, the Parent Indemnitees
shall have the right but not the obligation to participate in the defense of
Third Party Claims with its own counsel and at its own expense.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Stockholder Agent shall
not have the right to assume and control the defense of a Third Party Claim
with counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent (which acceptance shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the Company Holders shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Parent Indemnitees if
the Third Party Claim (A) is one in which the Stockholder Agent is also a
party and joint representation would, in the reasonable opinion of outside
legal counsel to the Parent Indemnitees, present a material conflict, (B)
involves a claim which, upon petition by the Parent Indemnitees, the
appropriate court rules that the Stockholder Agent failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or defend, (C) is one where non-monetary relief is sought
that is not merely incidental to the monetary relief that is sought, (D)
involves criminal allegations, (E) involves a claim related to Taxes (E)
relates to matters which, in the determination of Parent, would be expected to
have a significant effect on the future operation of the Company's business or
Parent's ownership or operation of the Company, (F) involves an IP Claim or
(G) involves a claim for monetary damages in excess of 75% of the amounts
remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund that are not subject to any
pending Claims. If the Stockholder Agent (x) does not, by written notice to
the Parent Indemnitees, elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim
within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice thereof, (y) having elected to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to retain counsel to
prosecute the action within fifteen (15) days of such election or (z) is
unable to assume and control the defense of such claim pursuant to this
Section 7.3(d)(ii), then in such case the Parent Indemnitees shall have the
right to defend such Third Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and
risk of the Company Holders, but in such case, without in any way waiving or
otherwise affecting the Parent Indemnitees' rights to seek indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(iii) If the Stockholder Agent has assumed the defense and control of a Third
Party Claim, then, subject to the prior written approval of Parent, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Stockholder Agent
shall be authorized to consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the entry
of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim; provided that such
compromise, settlement or judgment (A) does not involve

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

   
 

any finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any
wrongdoing by any Parent Indemnitee, (B) involves only the payment of money
damages (all of which shall be paid in full by the Company Holders (including
by release of funds from the Indemnification Escrow Fund) concurrently with
the effectiveness thereof), (C) will not encumber any of the assets of the
Parent Indemnitees and will not contain any restriction or condition that
adversely affects any Parent Indemnitee or the conduct of its business, (D)
does not include a finding or admission that would have an adverse effect on
other claims made or threatened against any Parent Indemnitee, (E) does not
impose an injunction or other equitable relief on any Parent Indemnitee, and
(F) includes, as a condition to any settlement or other resolution, a complete
and irrevocable release of the Parent Indemnitees from all Liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim. If a Parent Indemnitee has assumed the
defense and control of a Third Party Claim, Parent shall have the right in its
sole and absolute discretion (which shall be assessed solely on a subjective
standard of good faith, and not on an objective standard of reasonableness)
whether to settle any Third Party Claim, and the amount of any settlement
payment or extent of any other liabilities incurred by way of such settlement.

  

  

(iv) In defending or settling any Third Party Claim, Parent shall not be
deemed to be an agent of, and shall have no duty, including, without
limitation, any fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty, duty of good faith or duty of
disclosure, to the Company Holders or the Stockholder Agent.

  

  

(e) Direct Claims. In the event any Parent Indemnitee shall determine to
assert a claim that does not involve a Third Party Claim for indemnity against
the Stockholder Agent, on behalf of the Company Holders, the Parent Indemnitee
shall give written notice of such claim to the Stockholder Agent. Such notice
shall specify to the extent practicable, based on then-available information,
the facts constituting the basis for, and a good faith estimate of the amount
of the potential Losses reasonably expected to be incurred with respect to,
the claim asserted and the representation, warranty or covenant under which
the liability or obligation is asserted. The failure of any Parent Indemnitee
to give notice as provided in this Section 7.3(e) shall not relieve the
Company Holders from any liability except to the extent that the Company
Holders are actually and materially prejudiced by the failure or delay in
giving such notice.

  

  

7.4 Contribution. Neither the Stockholder Agent nor any Company Holder shall
make any claim for contribution from Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries with respect to any
indemnity claims arising under or in connection with this Agreement to the
extent that the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other Parent
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder for such claim, and the
Stockholder Agent and each Company Holder hereby waives any such right of
contribution from the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries it has or may have in the future.

  

  

7.5 Effect of Investigation. The right to indemnification, payment of any
indemnifiable Losses or any other remedy will not be affected by any
investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company or any other matter. The waiver of any condition
based on the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

   
 

accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of any indemnifiable Losses, or any other remedy
based on any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. No Parent
Indemnitee shall be required to show reliance on any representation, warranty,
certificate or other agreement in order for such Parent Indemnitee to be
entitled to indemnification hereunder. Parent and the Company each acknowledge
that such indemnifiable Losses, if any, would relate to unresolved
contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which if resolved at the
Effective Time would have led to a reduction in the Aggregate Consideration
that Parent would have paid in connection with the Merger.

  

  

Article VIII

  

  

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

  

  

8.1 Termination. Except as provided in Section 8.2, this Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

  

  

(a) By mutual written consent of the Company and Parent.

  

  

(b) By Parent or the Company if: (i) the Effective Time has not occurred
before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 31, 2017 (provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be
available to any party whose willful failure to fulfill any material
obligation hereunder has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Effective Time to occur on or before such date), (ii) a final, nonappealable
order of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority having competent
jurisdiction shall have been entered permanently preventing or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the Merger, or (iii) there shall be any Law
enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority having competent jurisdiction that would
make consummation of the Merger illegal.

  

  

(c) By Parent if there shall be any final, nonappealable Order of, or any Law
or Order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger, by
any Governmental or Regulatory Authority having competent jurisdiction, which
would: (i) prohibit Parent's ownership or operation of all or any portion of
the business of the Company or (ii) compel Parent to dispose of or hold
separate all or any portion of the Assets and Properties of the Company, or
limit its operation of the Company's business, as a result of the Merger.

  

  

(d) By Parent if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company
and (i) the Company is not using reasonable efforts to cure such breach or has
not cured such breach within fifteen (15) days after Parent delivers written
notice of such breach to the Company (provided, however, that no cure period
shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured) and, (ii)
if not cured within such fifteen (15) day period and at or prior to the
Closing, such breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

82  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) By the Company if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent and
(i) Parent is not using reasonable efforts to cure such breach or has not
cured such breach within fifteen (15) days after the Company delivers written
notice of such breach to Parent (provided, however, that no cure period shall
be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured) and, (ii) if not
cured within such fifteen (15) day period and at or prior to the Closing, such
breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.1 or Section 6.2, as the case may be, to be satisfied.

  

  

(f) By Parent if, at any time after approval of the Merger, this Agreement,
and the transactions contemplated hereby by the Company Stockholders, holders
of more than ten percent (10%) of the outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock (determined on an "as converted, as exercised, Company Common Stock-
equivalent" basis) shall have exercised, or shall have purported to have
exercised, appraisal, dissenters' or similar rights under applicable Law with
respect to their shares by virtue of the Merger.

  

  

(g) By Parent, if the Company shall not have obtained and delivered to Parent
the irrevocable Stockholder Written Consents of the Company Stockholders
representing the Requisite Stockholder Vote within twenty-four (24) hours
after the execution of this Agreement by the Company.

  

  

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of a valid termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, or their respective officers, directors or
stockholders or Affiliates or Associates in connection herewith; provided,
however, that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall each remain liable for
any breaches of this Agreement prior to its termination; provided, further,
that the provisions of Sections 5.4, 8.2, Article IX (exclusive of Section
9.3) and the applicable definitions set forth in Article X shall remain in
full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

  

  

8.3 Amendment. Except as is otherwise required by applicable Law at any time
before or after the Company Stockholders approve the Merger and this
Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time but
only by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment
hereto, duly and validly signed on behalf of and delivered to each of the
parties hereto; provided, however, that the consent of the Stockholder Agent
shall not be required in connection with any amendment to this Agreement that
does not affect the rights or obligations of the Stockholder Agent.

  

  

8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations of the other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions for the benefit
of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of the party against which such waiver or
extension is asserted. No waiver by any party of any term or condition of this
Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

   
 

a waiver of the same or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any
future occasion. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or
otherwise afforded, shall be cumulative and not alternative.

intended solely for the benefit of Parent and the Company and, with respect to
Article VII and Article IX only, the Stockholder Agent, and their respective
successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the parties to
confer third-party beneficiary rights, and this Agreement does not confer any
such rights, upon any other Person other than (i) the Parent Indemnitees
entitled to indemnification under Article VII and (ii) those Persons entitled
to receive such benefits as contemplated under Section 5.13.

  

  

9.5 No Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any right,
interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned (by operation of Law or
otherwise) and any attempt to do so shall be void; provided, however, that
Parent or Merger Sub shall be entitled to assign its rights, duties and
obligations hereunder, including Merger Sub's obligation to merge with the
Company, to any one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries or Affiliates of Parent
or Merger Sub; provided that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger
Sub from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the
foregoing sentence, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of
and is enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

  

  

9.6 Headings. The headings and table of contents used in this Agreement have
been inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit the
provisions hereof.

  

  

9.7 Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision shall be fully
severable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
(c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom, and (d) in lieu of such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a
part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in
terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

  

  

9.8 Governing Law. This Agreement, and any claim, controversy or dispute
arising under or related to this Agreement (whether based on contract, tort,
equity or otherwise), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York (other than its conflict of law principles
to the extent that the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction would
be required thereby, other than Section 5-1401 of the New York General
Obligations Law, which by its terms applies to this Agreement); provided,
however, that to the extent the Law of the State of Delaware shall be held to
govern the Merger, the Law of the State of Delaware shall apply.

  

  

9.9 Waiver of Trial by Jury. THE PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY WAIVE,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

86  

  

 

 

 

   
 

TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR
INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING
OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A
JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS
AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO
THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

  

  

9.10 Jurisdiction. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT SUBMITS TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK, NEW
YORK, IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT
OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT
AND AGREES NOT TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO IN ANY OTHER COURT.
EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE
MAINTENANCE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING SO BROUGHT AND WAIVES ANY BOND, SURETY
OR OTHER SECURITY THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED OF ANY OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT
THERETO. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT OR ANY OTHER
PROCESS THAT MIGHT BE SERVED IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE MADE ON SUCH
PARTY BY SENDING OR DELIVERING A COPY OF THE PROCESS TO THE PARTY TO BE SERVED
AT THE ADDRESS OF THE PARTY AND IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR THE GIVING OF
NOTICES IN SECTION 9.1. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 9.10, HOWEVER, SHALL AFFECT
THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE LEGAL PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY
LAW. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN THE EVENT THAT AN SUCH ACTION OR
PROCEEDING IS FILED IN A STATE COURT IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK, NOTHING IN THIS
SECTION 9.10 SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO REMOVE SUCH ACTION OR
PROCEEDING TO A FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT A
FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE JUDGMENT IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION 9.10 SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED BY
SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.

  

  

9.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and signatures may be delivered by facsimile or by electronic
mail in Portable Document Format (.pdf), each of which shall be deemed an

9.12 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that it would cause
irreparable damage to the other party in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that the other
party or parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
the United States or any state or province having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity
and prior to the valid exercise of any termination right by the parties in
accordance with Section 8.1.

  

  

9.13 Stockholder Agent of the Company Holders; Power of Attorney.

  

  

(a) Each Company Holder by virtue of the Company's approval and adoption of
this Agreement or other appointment authorization documentation (other than
holders of Dissenting Shares) or by accepting any consideration payable
hereunder hereby appoints Fortis Advisors LLC as its exclusive agent and
attorney-in-fact (the "Stockholder Agent") for and on behalf of the Company
Holders to act for the Company Holders with regard to all matters pertaining
to this Agreement, including, but not limited to:

  

  

(i) giving and receiving notices and communications under this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements;

  

  

(ii) authorize payment to Parent from the Adjustment Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of Section 1.18;

  

  

(iii) authorizing payment to any Parent Indemnitee from the Indemnification
Escrow Fund, or submitting to any additional payment to the Stockholder Agent
pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(ii), in each case, in satisfaction of claims by any
Parent Indemnitee, objecting to such payments, agreeing to, negotiating,
entering into settlements and compromises of, and complying with orders of
courts with respect to such claims, asserting, negotiating, entering into
settlements and compromises of, and complying with orders of courts with
respect to, any other claim by any Parent Indemnitee against any Company
Holder or by any Company Holder against any Parent Indemnitee or any dispute
between any Parent Indemnitee and any such Company Holder, in each case
relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby; and

  

  

(iv) taking all other actions that are either (A) necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Stockholder Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing
or (B) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement, the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Adjustment Escrow Agreement or the other
Ancillary Agreements.

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Agent shall have no obligation
to act on behalf of the Company Holders, except as expressly provided herein,
in the Escrow Agreements and, solely as it relates to the Company Holders (and
not Parent nor the Surviving Corporation), the Stockholder Agent engagement
agreement, and for purposes of clarity, except as otherwise

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

88  

  

 

 

 

   
 

provided herein, there are no obligations of the Stockholder Agent in any
ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

Each Company Holder agrees to receive correspondence from the Stockholder
Agent, including in electronic form. The Stockholder Agent may resign at any
time following ten (10) days' written notice to the parties to this Agreement,
provided that at such time a replacement acceptable to Parent is appointed.
Such agency may be changed by the Company Holders with the right to a majority
of the Indemnification Escrow Fund upon not less than ten (10) days' prior
written notice (signed by such Company Holders) to all of the Company Holders,
the Escrow Agent and Parent, which includes written confirmation of the
acceptance of its appointment as Stockholder Agent by the replacement
Stockholder Agent. Parent shall be permitted to rely on any such notice
without investigation for all purposes under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Agent, and the
Stockholder Agent shall not receive any compensation for its services other
than pursuant to that certain engagement letter to be entered into by and
among the Stockholder Agent, the Company and certain Company Holders. The
Stockholder Agent shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the Closing Payment
Certificate and the Final Allocation Certificate, (ii) rely upon any signature
believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has
proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Company Holder or
other party. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Agent,
including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to its
authority hereunder, shall constitute a decision of the Company Holders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company Holders and all
defenses which may be available to any Company Holder to contest, negate or
disaffirm the action of the Stockholder Agent taken in good faith under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreements or the Stockholder Agent engagement agreement
are waived.

  

  

(b) By executing this Agreement under the heading "Stockholder Agent," Fortis
Advisors LLC hereby (i) accepts its appointment and authorization to act as
Stockholder Agent as attorney-in-fact and agent on behalf of the Company
Holders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) agrees to
perform its obligations under, and otherwise comply with, this Section 9.13.

  

  

(c) Certain Company Holders have entered into an engagement agreement with the
Stockholder Agent to provide direction to the Stockholder Agent in connection
with its services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreements and the
Stockholder Agent engagement agreement (such Company Holders, including their
individual representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the
"Advisory Group"). The engagement agreement does not alter, modify or amend
any obligations, or impact any rights of Parent, as contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither the Stockholder Agent nor its members, managers, directors,
officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory
Group (collectively, the "Stockholder Agent Group") shall be liable to any
former Company Holder for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Stockholder
Agent without gross negligence or willful misconduct (and any act done or
omitted pursuant to the bona fide good faith advice of counsel, accountants
and other professionals and experts retained by the Stockholder Agent shall be
conclusive evidence of good faith). To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Company Holders shall severally and not jointly (based on
each such Company Holder's Pro-Rata Portion) indemnify the Stockholder Agent
Group, defend and hold it harmless from and

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

89  

  

 

 

 

   
 

against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs, judgments, amounts paid in settlement and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel, other skilled
professionals and experts and their staffs and all expenses of document
location, duplication and shipment and in connection with seeking recovery
from insurers) (collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in
connection with the execution and performance of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreements, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred;
provided that in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Stockholder Agent, the Stockholder Agent will
reimburse the Company Holders the amount of such indemnified Representative
Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful
misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholder Agent by the Company
Holders, such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Agent
from (i) the Stockholder Agent Fund (as defined below) and (ii) the
Indemnification Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Company Holders
(and not distributed or distributable to a Parent Indemnitee or subject to a
pending indemnification claim of a Parent Indemnitee) after the later to occur
of (A) the expiration of the Indemnification Escrow Period and (B) the date on
which all claims in respect of the Indemnification Escrow Fund have been
finally resolved and paid, but not before, pursuant to the terms hereof and of
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, at the time of distribution, and in each
case such recovery will be made from the Company Holders according to their
respective Pro-Rata Portion; provided that while this Section 9.13(c) allows
the Stockholder Agent to be paid from Stockholder Agent Fund and the
Indemnification Escrow Fund, this does not relieve the Company Holders from
their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Agent from seeking
any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Stockholder Agent be required to advance its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability on behalf of the Company Holders or otherwise.
Furthermore, the Stockholder Agent shall not be required to take any action
unless the Stockholder Agent has been provided with the funds, security or
indemnities, as contemplated in accordance with this Agreement, to protect the
Stockholder Agent against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Stockholder Agent in performing such actions. The Company
Holders acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the
resignation or removal of the Stockholder Agent or the termination of this
Agreement. The Company Holders shall establish a reserve to be held by the
Stockholder Agent in an amount equal to Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000) (the "Stockholder Agent Fund") from the Aggregate Consideration
with respect to the Company Holders based upon their Pro-Rata Portion to fund
potential expenses of the Stockholder Agent in carrying out its authorized
duties. The Stockholder Agent is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for
any loss of principal of the Stockholder Agent Fund other than as a result of
its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Agent is not
acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with
the Stockholder Agent Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution
obligations. The Company Holders will not receive any interest on the
Stockholder Agent Fund until such remaining Stockholder Agent Fund (if any) is
distributed. As soon as reasonably determined by the Stockholder Agent that
the Stockholder Agent Fund is no longer required to be withheld, the
Stockholder Agent shall distribute the remaining Stockholder Agent Fund (if
any) to the Escrow Agent (or directly to the Paying Agent if so instructed)
for further distribution to the Company Holders. The Stockholder Agent may
engage attorneys, accountants,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

90  

  

 

 

 

   
 

investment bankers, advisors, consultants and clerical personnel and obtain
such other professional and expert assistance, and maintain such records, as
the Stockholder Agent may deem reasonably necessary or desirable and incur
other out-of-pocket expenses related to performing its services hereunder and
paid out of the Stockholder Agent Fund. The Stockholder Agent may in good
faith rely conclusively upon information, reports, statements and opinions
prepared or presented by such professionals, and any action taken by the
Stockholder Agent based on such reliance shall be deemed conclusively to have
been taken in good faith.

  

  

(d) All of the immunities and powers granted to the Stockholder Agent under
this Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or any termination of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreements. The grant of authority provided for in
this Section 9.13 and the powers, immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Stockholder Agent Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence,
bankruptcy or liquidation of the respective Company Holder and shall be
binding on any successor thereto and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an
assignment by any Company Holders of the whole or any fraction of his, her or
its interest in the Escrow Funds.

  

  

(e) Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Payment Agent and the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon the (i) actions of the Stockholder Agent as the
duly authorized actions of the Company Holders, and Parent, the Company,
Merger Sub, the Payment Agent and the Escrow Agent are hereby released and
relieved from any and all Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with the instructions, decisions or acts of the Stockholder Agent
and (ii) Stockholder Agent's covenant to satisfy its obligations with respect
to the Net Adjustment Amount. Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Payment
Agent and the Escrow Agent are hereby expressly authorized to rely on the
genuineness of the signature of the Stockholder Agent or any instrument,
certificate or document. Upon receipt of any writing that, in the opinion of
Parent, reasonably appears to have been signed by the Stockholder Agent,
Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Payment Agent and the Escrow Agent may
each act upon the same without any further duty of inquiry as to the
genuineness of the writing.

  

  

9.14 Legal Representation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree, on
their own behalf and on behalf of their respective directors, members,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, and each of their respective
successors and assigns (all such parties, the "Waiving Parties"), that Goodwin
Procter LLP may represent any or all of the Company Holders in the event any
such Person so requests, in each case in connection with any dispute,
litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including under Section 1.18 (any such representation, the "Post-
Closing Representation"), and each of Parent and Merger Sub on behalf of
itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives
(and will not assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising
therefrom or relating thereto. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, for
itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees
that all communications between the Company, the Company Holders and any of
their respective Affiliates (the "Seller Group") and their counsel, including
Goodwin Procter LLP, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery and performance under this Agreement, any agreements
contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (including, without limitation, the Merger), or any matter relating to
any of the foregoing, are privileged communications between the Seller Group
and such counsel. From and after the Closing, each

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

91  

  

 

 

 

   
 

of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, on behalf of itself and the Waiving
Parties, waives and will not assert any attorney-client privilege with respect
to any communication between Goodwin Procter LLP and the Company or any Person
in the Seller Group occurring during the representation in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other agreements contemplated hereby and the consummation of the Merger in
connection with any Post-Closing Representation; provided that the foregoing
waiver shall not extend to any communication not involving this Agreement or
any agreement contemplated hereby or the consummation of the Merger, or to
communications with any Person other than the Seller Group; provided, further,
that the foregoing waiver shall not apply to any disputes with any third
party.
