Arbitration Association, with the expenses of the American Arbitration Association to be shared equally by the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser. The accounting firm shall address only the disputed items set forth in the Disputed Items Notice
and may not assign a value greater than the greatest value claimed for such item by either party or smaller than the smallest value claimed for such item by either party. The accounting firm will (i)&nbsp;resolve the disputed items specified in the
Disputed Items Notice and (ii)&nbsp;determine the Closing Purchase Price, as modified only by the resolution of such items. The determination of the selected accounting firm will be made within 30 days after being selected and will be final and
binding upon the parties. The fees, costs and expenses of the accounting firm so selected will be borne by the party whose positions generally did not prevail in such determination, or if the accounting firm determines that neither party could be
fairly found to be the prevailing party, then such fees, costs and expenses will be borne 50% by Holdings and 50% by the Purchaser. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
