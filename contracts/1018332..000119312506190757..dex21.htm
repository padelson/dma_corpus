Introduction

The Members own all of the outstanding membership interests of the Company.
The Members will effect the following transactions prior to the Closing (as
hereinafter defined): (a) the Members shall contribute 100% of their
membership interests in the Company to a newly-formed Delaware limited
liability company ("Holdings", and together with the Members, the "Sellers"),
that shall make an election to be treated as an S corporation as provided in
Section 1362(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")
and (b) Holdings shall make an election to have the Company be treated as a
qualified subchapter S subsidiary that is a disregarded entity as provided in
Section 1361(b)(3) of the Code (the transactions described in clauses (a) and

completion of the Pre-Closing Transactions, the Members will own all of the
issued and outstanding membership interests of Holdings, and Holdings will
own all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of the Company (the

the Purchaser on the terms set forth herein. The Pre-Closing Transactions,
the purchase of the Securities and the other transactions contemplated hereby
are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Transactions". The
parties intend that for federal income tax purposes the Transactions will be
treated as a purchase by Purchaser of the assets of the Company.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as

"Base Purchase Price" means $100,000,000.

"Closing Net Asset Value" means (i) the consolidated cash and cash

Expenses solely from the Sellers, such portion shall not be deemed to be part
of the Sellers Expenses for purposes of Section 1.2(c).

(c) Payments at Closing. At the Closing, the Purchaser will make or cause to

1.3. Closing. The purchase and sale of the Securities and the other
Transactions contemplated hereby shall take place at a closing
(the "Closing") to be held at the offices of Choate, Hall and Stewart LLP in
Boston, Massachusetts on (a) October 15, 2006 or (b) if the conditions to
Closing specified in ARTICLE 8 hereof are not satisfied or waived as of such
date (other than those conditions which are normally performed at the
Closing), on the date that is five business days after the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions to Closing, or on such other date as agreed to in
writing by the Company and the Purchaser (the "Closing Date").

1.4. Determination of Closing Purchase Price.

(a) Within 45 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will deliver to the
Sellers Representative a certificate (the "Closing Purchase Price
Certificate"), executed by the Purchaser, setting forth an itemized statement
of the Closing Net Asset Value, and a calculation of the Closing Purchase
Price.

(b) If the Sellers Representative delivers written notice (the "Disputed Items
Notice") to the Purchaser within 15 days after the date of the Closing
Purchase Price Certificate, stating that the Sellers Representative objects to
any items on the Closing Purchase Price Certificate, specifying the basis for
such objection in reasonable detail and setting forth the Sellers
Representatives proposed modifications to the Closing Purchase Price
Certificate, the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser will attempt to
resolve and finally determine and agree upon the Closing Purchase Price as
promptly as practicable.



 

3 (c) If the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser are unable to agree upon
the Closing Purchase Price within 15 days after delivery of the Disputed
Items Notice, the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser will refer the
matter to an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm mutually
selected by Purchaser and Sellers Representative, to resolve the disputed
items specified in the Disputed Items Notice. If the Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative are unable to agree on the selection of an accounting firm, the
accounting firm will be chosen by the American Arbitration Association, with
the expenses of the American Arbitration Association to be shared equally by
the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser. The accounting firm shall
address only the disputed items set forth in the Disputed Items Notice and
may not assign a value greater than the greatest value claimed for such item
by either party or smaller than the smallest value claimed for such item by
either party. The accounting firm will (i) resolve the disputed items
specified in the Disputed Items Notice and (ii) determine the Closing
Purchase Price, as modified only by the resolution of such items. The
determination of the selected accounting firm will be made within 30 days
after being selected and will be final and binding upon the parties. The
fees, costs and expenses of the accounting firm so selected will be borne by
the party whose positions generally did not prevail in such determination, or
if the accounting firm determines that neither party could be fairly found to
be the prevailing party, then such fees, costs and expenses will be borne 50%
by Holdings and 50% by the Purchaser.

(d) If the Sellers Representative does not deliver the Disputed Items Notice
to the Company within 15 days after the date of the Closing Purchase Price
Certificate, the calculation of the Closing Purchase Price specified in
the Closing Purchase Price Certificate will be conclusively presumed to be
true and correct in all respects and will be final and binding upon the
parties, and the Sellers Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with
the calculations of Closing Net Asset Value and Closing Purchase Price
specified in the Closing Purchase Price Certificate.

(e) Within five (5) days after the Closing Purchase Price is finally
determined: (i) if the aggregate amount paid at Closing under Section 1.2(c)
exceeds the Closing Purchase Price, Holdings shall pay to Purchaser an
aggregate amount equal to such excess, and (ii) if the aggregate amount paid
at Closing under Section 1.2(c) is less than the Closing Purchase Price, the
Purchaser shall pay to Holdings an aggregate amount equal to such difference.
The obligation of Holdings to make any payment required under this Section
1.4 shall be the joint and several obligation of the Sellers.

(f) The final determination of the Closing Purchase Price under this Section
1.4 shall not impair any other rights of a party under this Agreement
including, without limitation, any rights to indemnification. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, it is the intent of the parties that all of
the provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted to avoid requiring the
Sellers to pay (or receive a reduction in the Closing Purchase Price) twice
for the same item or loss. For the avoidance of doubt, if, for example, there
is any difference between the amounts or information set forth on the
Estimated Closing Purchase Price Certificate and the amounts or information
set forth on the Closing Purchase Price Certificate, and an adjustment
is made with respect thereto pursuant to this Section 1.4, Purchaser shall
not be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement with respect to such
difference.



 

4 1.5. Earnout Payments. If earned in accordance with _Schedule 1.5_ , the
Purchaser shall make additional payments to Holdings in accordance with the
terms and conditions contained in _Schedule 1.5_ , which additional payments,
if any, shall (i) not exceed $9,900,000 in the aggregate and (ii) be payable
in installments over four years in accordance with _Schedule 1.5_.

1.6. Escrow. The Escrow will be deposited at the Closing with the Escrow
Agent, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, shall
remain in escrow until the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date. If
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is entitled to indemnification under
Article 10, then the Purchaser shall have the right to submit a claim in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and the other
parties thereto. Each Material Contract is valid, binding and in full force

constitutes or which, with or without notice, the happening of any event
and/or the passage of time, could constitute a default or breach under any
such Material Contract by the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
other party thereto, or could cause the acceleration of any obligation or
loss of any rights of the Company or give rise to any right of termination or

material respects.

contract.

The parties agree to cooperate and promptly respond to any inquiries or
investigations initiated by the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of
Justice in connection with any such filings.

Purchaser with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and (2) if
such auditor agrees, representing that such financial statements comply with
the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. The Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that it shall be responsible for all costs and expenses relating
to the preparation of the financial statements and the audit thereof required

neither the Company nor any of the Sellers will, directly or indirectly, (a)
solicit any competing offers for the recapitalization or purchase of the
Company or the purchase of all or any substantial portion of the equity

Purchaser all such unsolicited offers or indications of interest.

5.6. Confidentiality. At all times following the Closing, no Seller shall,
directly or indirectly, disclose, divulge or make use of any trade secrets or
other information of a business, financial, marketing, technical or other
nature pertaining to the Company or the Business, including information of
others that the Company has agreed to keep confidential, except (a) to the
extent that such information shall have become public knowledge other than by
breach of this Agreement by any of the Sellers, (b) as required in connection
with the performance of such Sellers duties as an employee of the Company,
(c) to the extent that disclosure of such information is required by law or
legal process (but only after the Seller has provided the Company with
reasonable notice and opportunity to take action against any legally required
disclosure), or (d) to the extent that such information becomes lawfully
available to the Sellers,  



 

27  or their respective Affiliates, after the Closing Date on a non-confidential
basis from a third Person who is not under an obligation of confidentiality
to the Purchaser or the Company.

5.7. Noncompetition.

(a) During the Noncompetition Period (as hereinafter defined) (i) no Seller
will, directly or indirectly, or as a stockholder, partner, member, manager,
employee, consultant or other owner or participant in any Person other than
the Company, engage in or assist any other Person to engage in any Covered
Business (as hereinafter defined) anywhere in the United States, or anywhere
else in the world where the Company does business, (ii) no Seller will,
directly or indirectly, solicit or endeavor to entice away from the Company,
or offer employment or a consulting position to, or otherwise interfere with
the business relationship of the Company with, any Person who is, or was
within the one year period prior thereto, an employee of or consultant to the
Company and (iii) no Seller will, directly or indirectly, solicit or endeavor
to entice away from the Company, endeavor to reduce the business conducted
with the Company by, or otherwise interfere with the business relationship of
the Company with, any Person who is, or was within the one-year period prior
thereto, a customer or client of, supplier, vendor or service provider to, or
other Person having business relations with, the Company. The foregoing shall
not prevent any of the following: (i) any Seller from owning for investment
purposes up to 3% of the outstanding securities of a publicly traded company
engaged in any Covered Business, or (ii) any Member from making and/or owning
an equity investment of up to 3% of the outstanding securities in a privately-
held company that is engaged in the Covered Business so long as such equity
investment is held as a passive investment only and not with a view towards
controlling or directing the affairs of such Person.

(b) For purposes of this Section 5.7, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

"Company" shall mean the Company, each of its subsidiary, parent and
affiliated companies, whether now existing or created in the future, and all
of their respective successors and assigns.

"Covered Business" means (i) any business in which the Company is engaged
as of the Closing, and (ii) for any Seller that is an employee of the Company
after the Closing, shall also include any business in which the Company is
engaged during such Sellers employment.

"Noncompetition Period" means the period commencing as of the Closing and
ending as of the later of (i) the 3 year anniversary of the Closing and (ii)

Closing (other than Ann J. Holcomb and Ronald Hammond, Jr.), the 2 year
anniversary of the termination of such Sellers employment or
engagement, whether by the Company or the Seller.

5.8. Injunctive Relief. The Company and the Sellers acknowledge that any
breach or threatened breach of the provisions of Sections 5.5, 5.6 or 5.7 of
this Agreement will cause irreparable injury to the Purchaser, the Company
and/or their respective subsidiaries for which an adequate monetary remedy
does not exist. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach or threatened
breach, the Purchaser (in the case of Section 5.5) and the Purchaser, the
Company  



 

28  and/or such subsidiaries (in the cases of Sections 5.6 and 5.7) shall be
entitled, in addition to the exercise of other remedies, to seek and (subject
to court approval) obtain injunctive relief, without necessity of posting a
bond, restraining the Company and/or the Sellers, as the case may be, from
committing such breach or threatened breach. The right provided under this
Section 5.8 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and
remedies available to the Purchaser, the Company or such subsidiaries.

5.9. Reasonable Restrictions. Each Seller (a) has carefully read and
understands all of the provisions of this Agreement and has had the
opportunity for this Agreement to be reviewed by counsel, (b) acknowledges
that the duration, geographical scope and subject matter of Sections 5.6 and
5.7 of this Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect the goodwill,
customer relationships, legitimate business interests, trade secrets and
confidential information of the Business, (c) acknowledges that the Purchaser
would not have closed the Transactions without the benefits contained in this
Agreement, (d) will be able to earn a satisfactory livelihood without
violating this Agreement and (e) understands that this Agreement is
assignable by the Company and the Purchaser and shall inure to the benefit of
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

5.10. Company Intellectual Property. If any Seller owns or shall at any time
hereafter acquire any rights in any Company Intellectual Property, such
Seller shall, and hereby does, transfer all of its rights, title and interest
in such Company Intellectual Property to the Company for no additional
consideration. Each Seller shall execute and deliver such additional documents
and instruments and take such other actions as the Purchaser shall reasonably
request to give effect to the provisions of this Section. Each of the Sellers
hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Purchaser and its agents as its
attorneys-in-fact to act for and on such Sellers behalf to execute and file
any document and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the
purposes of the foregoing with the same legal force and effect as if executed
by such Seller.

5.11. General Release. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller voluntarily,
knowingly and irrevocably releases and forever discharges the Company and its
officers, directors, employees and Affiliates from any and all actions,
agreements, amounts, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities and obligations of
every kind, nature or description, known or unknown, arising or existing prior
to the Closing, except for any rights of such Seller under this Agreement and
any other agreements contemplated by this Agreement to be executed at or prior
to Closing, including, without limitation, employment and consulting
agreements.

5.12. Sale Bonus Plans; Key Employee Noncompetition Agreements.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall transfer and assign all of its
interest to Holdings, and Holdings shall assume all obligations of the
Company under the incentive plans and bonus agreements set forth on _Schedule
5.12(a)_ (the "Sale Bonus Plans"). The Members shall cause Holdings, and
Holdings shall, make the maximum awards authorized under the Sale Bonus Plans
and Holdings shall make all required payments thereunder.

(b) The Company has executed Confidential Information, Invention Assignment
and Non-Competition Agreements with its employees named in _Schedule 5.12(b)_
(the "Noncompetition Agreements"). Prior to Closing, the Sellers shall cause
the  



 

29  Noncompetition Agreements to be amended to delete any reference to the Sale
Bonus Plans. If, subsequent to Closing, the Company or the Purchaser
notifies Holdings that any such employee has breached the covenants contained
in a Noncompetition Agreement, then, without limiting the remedies available
to the Company, Holdings shall (if Holdings, or a trustee appointed by
Holdings, agrees that such breach has occurred, which shall be in Holdings
or such Trustees, as the case may be, sole discretion) exercise all of its
legal and equitable remedies, including any rights it may have under the Sale
Bonus Plans resulting from the employees non-compliance with the
Noncompetition Agreements.

5.13. Joinder. Upon the formation of Holdings in connection with the Pre-
Closing Transactions, each of the Members shall take all actions necessary to
cause Holdings to become a signatory to this Agreement, agreeing to be bound
by all the terms of this Agreement (which event shall not be deemed to be an
amendment of this Agreement) pursuant to an instrument of accession or other
joinder agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 5.13_
(the "Joinder Agreement").

5.14. Notice of Certain Events. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the
other parties hereto of (a) any event, condition, fact, circumstance,
occurrence, transaction or other item of which such party becomes aware after
the date hereof and prior to the Closing that would constitute a violation or
breach of this Agreement (or a breach of any representation or
warranty contained herein) or, if the same were to continue to exist as of
the Closing Date, would constitute the non-satisfaction of any of the
conditions set forth in Article 8 hereof, and (b) any event, condition, fact,
circumstance, occurrence, transaction or other item of which such party
becomes aware which would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement had such event, condition, fact, circumstance,
occurrence, transaction or other item existed as of the date hereof;
provided, however, that except for the execution of new customer contracts or
changes in the compensation, title or responsibilities of employees in each
case permitted under Section 5.1(b) hereof, and except for new hires of
indirect personnel, no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.

 

5.15. Employees and Benefit Plans.

(a) Purchaser will cause the Company to employ or to continue to employ the
Employees as of the Closing Date as set forth in _Schedule 5.15 _(the
"Transferred Employees"), with the understanding that such employment shall
be at will for all employees other than those who have entered into employment
agreements with the Company.

(b) Unless commercially unreasonable, Purchaser will cause the Company to
maintain in effect for at least the one year period immediately following the
Closing the Benefit Plans of the Company in effect as of Closing, as set
forth on _Schedule 3.22(a)_ , including, without limitation, the Companys
medical and dental plan, disability benefit plan, life insurance plan, 401(k)
plan, bonus plan(s) and severance benefit plan. Thereafter, with respect to
the Transferred Employees, Purchaser (or the Company) shall (i) cause any
Transferred Employee that was covered under a Benefit Plan of the Company
immediately prior to the termination thereof to be covered by a reasonably
comparable employee benefit plan, program, or  



 

30  arrangement maintained by the Purchaser or the Company without limitations
on pre-existing conditions (and the amount of any expenses incurred prior to
the Closing Date under the Benefit Plans of the Company shall be credited
toward satisfaction of deductibles under the benefit plans of the Purchaser or
the Company), and (ii) recognize the service completed with the Company by the
Transferred Employees prior to the Closing Date for purposes of determining
eligibility service and vesting service under any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement maintained by Purchaser or the Company for their
employees on or after termination of any of the Benefit Plans.

5.16. Pre-Closing Transactions. For the period commencing as of the date
hereof and ending as of the Closing Date, each of the Company and the Sellers
shall use all reasonable efforts to consummate the Pre-Closing Transactions in
form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each of the Company and the Sellers shall furnish to
Purchaser drafts of all proposed documents related to the consummation of the
Pre-Closing Transactions (including without limitation all organizational
documents of Holdings and all assignment or transfer documents) and provide
Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to review, comment and approve all
such documents. For avoidance of doubt, none of the Pre-Closing Transaction
documents shall be finalized without Purchasers prior approval.

ARTICLE 6

COVENANTS OF THE PURCHASER

6.1. Representations and Warranties. Until the Closing Date, the Purchaser
will not take any action that would cause any of the representations and

in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same force and
effect as if such representations and warranties had been made on and as of
the Closing Date.

6.2. Efforts. Pending the Closing, the Purchaser will use all reasonable
efforts to cause the conditions specified in Section 8.2 to be satisfied as
soon as practicable.

6.3. Confidentiality. Pending the Closing, all proprietary information

sources; _provided_ that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to
information which (a) is lawfully and independently obtained by the Purchaser
from a third party (entitled to disclose such information) without restriction
as to disclosure by the Purchaser, (b) was known by the Purchaser prior to
its disclosure by or on behalf of the Company, (c) is in the public domain or
enters into the public domain through no fault of the Purchaser, (d)

writing by the Company, the Purchaser will cause to be delivered to the
Company all materials obtained by the Purchaser from or on behalf of the
Company, whether obtained before or after the date of this Agreement.



 

31 6.4. Certain Security Clearances. Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees that
it will cause the Company to hold and maintain the security clearances of
John A. Cross and Louise V. Brouillette from and after Closing so long as (a)
such Persons remain engaged by the Company pursuant to their Consulting
Agreements and (b) the relevant customers approve the maintenance of such
security clearances.

shall (a) treat and report the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement in

for purposes of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax and (b) not take any

Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Purchaser. All Tax Returns to be

otherwise required by law. The Sellers shall be responsible for all Taxes of
Sellers and the Company for all Pre-Closing Taxable Periods, other than with
respect to the Company the Tax reserve set forth on the face of the most
recent balance sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) (excluding any reserve
for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
Tax income) to the extent reflected in Closing Net Asset Value as finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.4 and shall pay to (or as directed by) the
Company any Taxes of the Company for all Pre-Closing Taxable Periods to the
extent such Taxes have not already been paid by the Sellers (including
payments made by the Company or the Sellers prior to the Closing), and such
payments shall be made no later than five (5) business days prior to the due
date for paying such amount of Taxes to the relevant tax authority.

7.3. Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date. The
Company shall cause to be prepared and filed any Tax Returns of the Company
for taxable periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the
Closing Date. The Sellers shall be responsible for all Taxes of Sellers and
the Company which relate to the portions ending at the close of business on
the Closing Date of any taxable periods to the extent such Taxes have not
already been paid by the Sellers (including payments made by the Company or
the Sellers prior to the Closing) other than with respect to the Company the
Tax reserve set forth on the face of the most recent balance sheet (rather
than in any notes thereto)(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) to the
extent reflected in Closing Net Asset Value as finally determined pursuant to
Section 1.4. The Sellers shall pay to (or as directed by the company) any such
amounts relating to the Company, and such payments shall be made in each
applicable case by no later than five (5) business days  



 

32  prior to the due date for paying such amount of Taxes to the relevant tax
authority. For purposes of this Section 7.3, in the case of any Taxes that
are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which
relates to the portion of such taxable period ending at the close of business
on the Closing Date shall (a) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based
upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period,
and (b) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable
period ended at the close of business on the Closing Date. Any credits
relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing
Date shall be on a basis consistent with the allocations made pursuant to the
preceding sentence. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a reasonable manner that endeavors to
be consistent with the prior practice of the Company to the extent such
practice complies with applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, any Tax liability of Holdings or the
Company resulting from income or gain recognized under Section 1374 of the
Code as a result of any actual or deemed asset sale (and for all
corresponding foreign, state and local tax law purposes) shall be the
responsibility of the Seller.

7.4. Cooperation on Tax Matters.

(a) The Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers shall cooperate fully, to
the extent reasonably requested, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 7.3 or otherwise, and any audit, litigation, or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return filing,
audit, litigation, or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder.

(b) The Sellers agree (i) to provide to the Company, upon request, all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Company, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record-retention agreements entered into with any Tax authority, and (ii) to
give the Company reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records and, if the Company so requests, the
Sellers shall allow the Company to take possession of such books and records.

(c) If requested by the Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers will cooperate
with the Purchaser to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority or any other Person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed upon the
Company (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
Transactions contemplated hereby).

7.5. Control of Audits. After the Closing Date, except as set forth in the
next sentence, the Company shall control the conduct, through counsel of its
own choosing, of any  



 

33  audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding involving
any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to the Company (each,
a "Contest"). In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates
solely to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, the Sellers shall control the conduct of
such Contest, but the Company shall have the right to participate in such
Contest at its own expense, and the Sellers shall not settle, compromise
and/or concede any portion of such Contest that could affect the Tax liability
of the Company for any taxable year (or portion thereof) after the Closing
Date without the written consent of Company, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld; _provided_ that, if the Sellers fail to assume control of the
conduct of any such Contest within 30 days following the receipt by the
Sellers of notice of such Contest, the Company shall have the right to assume
control of such Contest and shall be able to settle, compromise and/or concede
any portion of such Contest.

7.6. Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property
gains, stamp, registration, and other such Taxes and fees incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be shared equally between the Purchaser
on the one hand, and the Sellers on the other hand, with 50% being paid by
the Purchaser and 50% being paid by the Sellers when due, and the Company
will, at the expense of the Purchaser and the Sellers (shared equally on a
50/50 basis), file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property gains,
stamp, registration, and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable
law, the Purchaser and the Sellers will join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation.

(a) by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Sellers;

(b) by the Purchaser, if the Company or the Sellers shall have breached or
failed to perform in any material respect any of their respective obligations,
covenants or agreements under this Agreement, or if any of the representations
and warranties of the Sellers and/or the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall not be true and correct to the extent set forth in Section 8.1(a), and

reasonable satisfaction within 10 days after the Purchaser gives the Company

(f) by the Purchaser or the Sellers, if the Closing shall not have occurred

except that this Agreement may not be terminated under this Section by or on

ARTICLE 10

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

10.1. Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein shall survive the Closing and any investigation or finding
made by or on behalf of the Purchaser, the Sellers or the Company. No
action for a breach of the representations and warranties contained herein
shall be brought more than eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date,
except for (a) claims arising out of the representations and warranties
contained in Article 2 (Representations and Warranties Concerning Members) or
Sections 3.4 (Due Authorization; No-Conflict), 3.6 (Capitalization) or 4.2
(Organization and Authority; Consents; No Conflicts), which shall survive
indefinitely after the Closing, (b) claims arising out of the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 3.19 (Tax Matters), 3.22 (ERISA;
Compensation and Benefit Plans) _,_ 3.25 (Affiliate Transactions), 3.27
(Brokers) or 4.5 (Brokers) which shall survive until thirty (30) days after
the expiration of the statute of limitations period (including all extensions
thereof) applicable to the underlying subject matter being represented, and
(c) claims of which the Sellers have been notified with reasonable
specificity by the Purchaser, or claims of which the Purchaser has been
notified with reasonable specificity by the Sellers, within such 18-month
period. The representations and warranties contained in Article 2 and Sections
3.4, 3.6, 3.19, 3.22, 3.25, 3.27, 4.2 and 4.5 are sometimes collectively
referred to herein as the "Specified Representations".

10.2. Indemnification Limits. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties (as
hereinafter defined) shall not be entitled to recover any Losses (as
hereinafter defined) for breach of the representations and warranties of the
Sellers and/or the Company contained herein, (a) with respect to any
individual claim of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties therefor, unless and
only to  



 

38  the extent that, such claim exceeds $10,000, (b) unless, and only to the
extent that, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties cumulative aggregate claims
therefor exceed $500,000, or (b) for a cumulative aggregate amount in excess
of $10,000,000; _provided_ , that claims for breach of any of the Specified
Representations shall not be subject to the foregoing limits and shall not
be included in the determination of whether the limit in clause (c) has been
reached. For all purposes of this Article 10, when determining whether a
representation or warranty of any Seller or the Company has been breached or
is inaccurate and the amount of the Losses, any Company Material Adverse
Effect or other materiality qualifier contained in any such representation or
warranty will be disregarded.

10.3. Indemnification by the Sellers.

(a) Subject to the other terms of this Article 10, each of John A. Cross and
Louise V. Brouillette (collectively, the "Principal Members") agrees jointly
and severally, and each of Ann J. Holcomb, Ronald Hammond, Jr. and Mark Oliva
(collectively, the "Minority Members") agrees severally and not jointly, to
indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its Affiliates, including without
limitation the Company (the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") harmless from and
against all claims, liabilities, obligations, costs, damages, losses and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs of investigation) of
any nature (collectively, "Losses") arising out of or relating to (i) any
breach or violation of the representations or warranties of the Sellers
(other than those set forth in Article 2) or the Company set forth in this
Agreement (including the schedules), (ii) any breach or violation of the
covenants or agreements of the Company set forth in this Agreement required
to be performed prior to or at the Closing, (iii) any breach or violation of
covenants or agreements of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement, (iv) the
failure of any portion of the Indebtedness or the Sellers Expenses to be
paid at or prior to Closing (other than such Indebtedness for which the
Purchaser is to make payment pursuant to Section 1.2(c)), (v) any Lien on any
property or assets of the Company after the Closing as a result of matters
existing or relating to any period prior to the Closing, other than Permitted
Liens, (vi) any litigation, suit, proceeding, arbitration or investigation
with respect to the affairs of the Company prior to the Closing or (vii) any
failure by Holdings to pay in full and satisfy all obligations to employees of
the Company (including all payments and obligations to be made or performed at
Closing or at anytime after Closing) under the Sale Bonus Plans. The
Sellers shall not have a right of contribution, or any other means of
recovery, from the Company for the Sellers indemnification obligations
hereunder.

(b) Each Member shall severally, but not jointly, indemnify and hold the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless from and against all Losses arising out
of or relating to any breach or violation of the representations or
warranties of such Member in Article 2 of this Agreement (including the
schedules).

(c) Subject to the other limitations set forth herein, the indemnification
and hold harmless obligations of the Principal Members and the Minority
Members with respect to Losses of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant
to Section 10.3(a) shall be limited to each such Members Pro Rata Share (as
defined below) thereof; provided, however, that to the extent that any
Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant
to Section 10.3(a) and such indemnification is not available for any reason
from any Member, each of the Principal Members shall be jointly and severally
liable for the full amount of such Losses.  



 

39  In the event that the indemnification and hold harmless obligations of
either of the Principal Members with respect to Losses of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 10.3(a) shall be in excess of such
Members Pro Rata Share thereof, such Member shall be entitled to contribution
from each other Member in accordance with and to the extent of each such other
Members Pro Rata Share of such Losses. In order to exercise their respective
rights to the foregoing contribution with respect to any specific Losses, each
Principal Member, as the case may be, shall make a written demand therefor
from each other Member. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
application of the contribution right set forth in this paragraph cause any
Member to be liable for more than such Members Pro Rata Share of the subject
Losses. "Pro Rata Share" for a specified Member shall mean the percentage set
forth opposite his or her name as set forth on _Schedule 10.3(c)_.

(d) No Purchaser Indemnified Party may initiate a claim for indemnification
under this Agreement without the prior approval of the Purchaser.

10.4. Indemnification by the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
the Sellers harmless from and against all Losses arising out of or relating to
any breach or violation of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement.

10.5. Procedures for Indemnification of Third Party Claims.

(a) A party or parties entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to a
third party claim (the "Indemnified Party") will give the party or parties
required to provide such indemnification (the "Indemnifier") prompt written
notice of any legal proceeding, claim or demand instituted by any third party
(in each case, a "Claim") in respect of which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

(b) If the Indemnifier provides written notice to the Indemnified Party
stating that the Indemnifier is responsible for the entire Claim within 10
days after the Indemnifiers receipt of written notice from the Indemnified
Party of such Claim, the Indemnifier shall have the right, at the
Indemnifiers expense, to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with such Claim and to have the Indemnified Party represented by counsel,
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, selected by the
Indemnifier; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate in any
proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its expense; _provided further_ ,
that the Purchaser, at any time when it believes in good faith that any Claim
is having or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Business or assets, affairs, condition (financial or otherwise) or
prospects of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, may assume the defense
and settlement of such Claim in good faith, with counsel of its choice, and be
fully indemnified therefor; and _provided further_ , that the Indemnifier may
not enter into a settlement of any Claim without the written consent of
the Indemnified Party unless such settlement provides the Indemnified Party
with a full release from such Claim and requires no more than a monetary
payment for which the Indemnified Party is fully indemnified.

(c) The parties will cooperate fully with each other in connection with the
defense of any Claim.



 

40 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event of
a Contest, the provisions of Section 7.5 shall govern.

10.6. Right of Set-Off. If the Sellers have not satisfied in cash any
indemnification obligation owed by them hereunder, the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates may, at their discretion, satisfy the unpaid portion of such
obligation by, to the extent permitted by law, setting-off against any amounts
due and owing from the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to any of the
Sellers including, without limitation, any amounts due to the Sellers pursuant
to Section 1.5 and _Schedule 1.5_.

10.7. Escrow Agreement. If any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties seeks to
make a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3(a), then the
Purchaser shall be required to submit such claim in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement prior to any such Purchaser Indemnified Party seeking
payment directly from any Seller with respect to such claim; provided,
however, that in the case of an indemnification claim by any Purchaser
Indemnified Party relating to either (a) the failure of Holdings to pay any
portion of the amount due to Purchaser after the final determination of the
Closing Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.4(e) or (b) any failure by
Holdings to pay in full and satisfy all obligations to employees of the
Company (including all payments and obligations to be made or performed at
Closing or at anytime after Closing) under the Sale Bonus Plans, such
Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to first seek payment directly
from any Seller with respect to such claim prior to submitting such claim in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 

10.8. Adjustment to Purchase Price. All indemnification payments paid pursuant
to this Article shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, be treated as
an adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes.

10.9. Limitations on Remedies. No party hereto shall be liable to the other
for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages claimed
by such other party resulting from such first partys breach of its
obligations, agreements, representations or warranties hereunder, provided
that nothing under this Section 10.9 shall preclude any recovery by an
Indemnified Party against an Indemnifier for third party Claims.

10.10. Calculation of Amount, Claims and Losses. The amount of any claims or
Losses subject to indemnification under Section 10.3 shall be calculated net
of any amounts recovered by the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the
Company after the Closing) under applicable insurance policies (but taking
into account any deductible or retention and initial premium increase
resulting therefrom) held by the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the
Company after the Closing), and the Purchaser agrees to make or cause to be
made all reasonable claims for insurance under such policies that may be
applicable to the matter giving rise to the indemnification claim hereunder.
The amount of any claims or Losses subject to indemnification under Section
10.3 shall be calculated net of the present value of any Tax benefits to the
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Company after the Closing)
resulting from the matter giving rise to the indemnification claim hereunder
(computed at the highest effective marginal tax rates at which the Purchaser
is then paying Taxes and limited to the extent that the Tax benefits can be
utilized by the Purchaser).
