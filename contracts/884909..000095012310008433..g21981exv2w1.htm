<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER </B>dated as of February&nbsp;2, 2010, between and among Nipro
Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of Japan (&#147;<U>Nipro</U>&#148;), Nippon Product
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nipro (the
&#147;<U>Acquisition Corporation</U>&#148;), and Home Diagnostics, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(&#147;<U>HDI</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boards of directors of HDI, Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation have each determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders for Nipro to acquire HDI upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In furtherance of such acquisition, Nipro proposes to cause the Acquisition Corporation to
make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the
&#147;<U>Offer</U>&#148;) to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$.01 per share (&#147;<U>Common Stock</U>&#148;), of HDI for $11.50 per share (such amount, or any greater
amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the &#147;<U>Offer Price</U>&#148;), net to the sellers
in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board of directors of HDI has unanimously approved the making of the Offer and resolved to
recommend that HDI&#146;s stockholders tender their shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in furtherance of such acquisition, the boards of directors of HDI, Nipro and the
Acquisition Corporation have each unanimously approved this Agreement and declared its advisability
and approved the merger (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;) of the Acquisition Corporation with and into HDI in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the &#147;<U>Delaware Act</U>&#148;)
following the consummation of the Offer and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Nipro is entering into
agreements with certain stockholders of HDI pursuant to which such stockholders are agreeing to
tender the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them pursuant to the Offer and to vote in
favor of the Merger, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein and for other good
and valuable consideration, the value, receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

are continuing, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 10 business days
after the date of this Agreement, Nipro will cause the Acquisition Corporation to commence
the Offer in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;<U>SEC</U>&#148;)

Offer for up to two additional 10 business day periods if so requested in writing by HDI.
Nipro may cause the Acquisition Corporation, without the consent of HDI and in its sole
discretion, to extend the Offer for successive extension periods expiring on or before
April&nbsp;30, 2010 (the &#147;<U>End Date</U>&#148;), each extension period not exceeding 20 business
days, if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the conditions set forth on
<U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> are not satisfied and for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or the Nasdaq Global Select
Market. In addition, Nipro may cause the Acquisition Corporation, without the consent of
HDI and in its sole discretion, to extend the Offer after acceptance for payment of shares
of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer for a further period of time not to exceed
20 business days by means of a subsequent offering period pursuant to Rule&nbsp;14d-11 under the
Securities Exchange Act.

and pay for any shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer will be subject to
the satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> (any of which may
be waived by Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation in their sole discretion, except that
the Minimum Tender Condition may not be waived) and to the other conditions in this
Agreement. Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation expressly reserve the right to modify the
terms of the Offer, except that without the consent of HDI, Nipro and the Acquisition
Corporation will not (i)&nbsp;reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Offer,
(ii)&nbsp;reduce the Offer Price, (iii)&nbsp;modify or add to the conditions set forth in <U>Exhibit
A</U>, (iv)&nbsp;except as provided in Section&nbsp;1.1(b), extend the Offer, (v)&nbsp;change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, or (vi)&nbsp;otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse
to the holders of Common Stock. Nothing contained in this Section&nbsp;1.1(c) (but otherwise
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) will limit or restrict the ability
of Nipro to cause the Acquisition Corporation, and for the Acquisition Corporation, to
increase the Offer Price and in connection therewith to extend the period of time during
which the Offer remains open for acceptance, including in the case of such Offer Price
increase any extension required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
SEC or the staff thereof or of the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Nipro
will cause the Acquisition Corporation to pay for all shares of Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that the Acquisition Corporation becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable and in any event no more
than two business days after the expiration of the Offer. The Acquisition Corporation may,
at any time, transfer or assign to one or more subsidiaries of Nipro the right to purchase
all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any
such transfer or assignment will not relieve Nipro or the Acquisition Corporation of its
respective obligations under the Offer or prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to
receive payment for shares of Common Stock validly tendered and accepted for payment.

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, the Acquisition Corporation
will not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC, including Rule&nbsp;14e-l(c) under the Securities Exchange Act, pay for any shares of Common
Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer unless (a)&nbsp;there has been validly tendered (including by
notice of guaranteed delivery) and not withdrawn prior to the time of the expiration of the Offer
(including any extensions thereof in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.1(b) of this Agreement, the
&#147;<U>Determination Time</U>&#148;) that number of shares of Common Stock which represents, together with
all other shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation, a
majority in voting power of the Fully Diluted Shares (the &#147;<U>Minimum Tender Condition</U>&#148;) and
(b)&nbsp;the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act has terminated or expired. The term &#147;<U>Fully
Diluted Shares</U>&#148; means all outstanding securities entitled generally to vote in the election of
directors of HDI on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the exercise, conversion or
exchange of all options, warrants, rights and securities exercisable or exchangeable for or
convertible into such voting securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, the Acquisition
Corporation will not be required to accept for payment or to pay for any shares of Common Stock not
theretofore accepted for payment or paid for, and, subject to Section&nbsp;1.1(b) of this Agreement, may
terminate or amend the Offer, if at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and before the
acceptance of any such shares of Common Stock for payment or the payment therefor, any of the
following conditions exists:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any consent, authorization, order and approval of or filing with any third party,
governmental commission, board or other regulatory authority required in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has not been obtained
or made, except where the failure to obtain or make such consent, authorization, order,
approval or filing would not, from and after the Determination Time, have a HDI Material
Adverse Effect or Nipro Material Adverse Effect;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) one or more of the parties to this Agreement is subject to any (i)&nbsp;pending or
threatened (in writing) claim, action, suit or proceeding by any governmental authority in
connection with which the plaintiff or claimant seeks to restrict or prohibit the
consummation of, or seeks material damages or other material payments in connection with,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;pending claim, action, suit or
proceeding by any party other than a governmental authority in connection with which the
plaintiff or claimant seeks to materially restrict or prohibit the consummation of, or
seeks material damages or other material payments in connection with, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case to the extent that Nipro determines in good
faith that (A)&nbsp;there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse outcome or result in
connection with such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (B)&nbsp;such adverse outcome or
result would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the business,
condition (financial or otherwise), operations or results of operations of Nipro, HDI or
their respective Subsidiaries, or (iii)&nbsp;statute, law, rule or regulation or any judgment,
decree, order or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction which prohibits or makes
illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

or (e)&nbsp;of this Agreement is not true and correct in all respects other than de minimis
inaccuracies as of the Determination Time as though made on and as of the
Determination Time;

(read without any materiality or material adverse effect qualifications, other than the
representation and warranty set forth in Section&nbsp;4.8, which will be read with a material
adverse effect qualification) are not true and correct of the Determination Time as though
made on and as of the Determination Time (except for representations and warranties that
are made as of a specific date on or prior to the date of this Agreement, which
representations and warranties will have been true and correct as of such date), except for
failures of such representations and warranties to be true and correct that, individually
or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a HDI
Material Adverse Effect;

to the Determination Time);

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) there has been publicly disclosed or Nipro has otherwise become aware that
beneficial ownership (determined as set forth in Rule&nbsp;13d-3 promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act) of more than 15% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock has
been acquired by another person or entity (including any group as defined in the Securities
Exchange Act), unless such shares have been duly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not
withdrawn as of the Determination Time;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which, in the sole judgment of Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation, in any such case, and
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition (including any action or inaction
by Nipro, the Acquisition Corporation or any of their affiliates), makes it inadvisable to proceed
with such acceptance for payment or payment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation
and may be asserted by Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to such condition or may be waived by Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation in whole or in
part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion, except that the Minimum Tender
Condition may not be waived. The failure by Nipro, the Acquisition Corporation or any of their
affiliates at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any
such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances will
not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right will
be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
