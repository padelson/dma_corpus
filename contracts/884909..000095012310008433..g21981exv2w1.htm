AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of February 2, 2010, between and among Nipro Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of Japan (" _Nipro_ "), Nippon Product Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nipro (the " _Acquisition Corporation_ "), and Home Diagnostics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _HDI_ "). 

  

 The boards of directors of HDI, Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation have each determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders for Nipro to acquire HDI upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 In furtherance of such acquisition, Nipro proposes to cause the Acquisition Corporation to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share (" _Common Stock_ "), of HDI for $11.50 per share (such amount, or any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the sellers in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer. 

  

 The board of directors of HDI has unanimously approved the making of the Offer and resolved to recommend that HDIs stockholders tender their shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 Also in furtherance of such acquisition, the boards of directors of HDI, Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation have each unanimously approved this Agreement and declared its advisability and approved the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of the Acquisition Corporation with and into HDI in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Act_ ") following the consummation of the Offer and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Nipro is entering into agreements with certain stockholders of HDI pursuant to which such stockholders are agreeing to tender the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them pursuant to the Offer and to vote in favor of the Merger, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the value, receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1 
 THE OFFER 

   

 _Section 1.1. The Offer._ 

   

 (a) Provided that this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1 and none of the events set forth in paragraph 2 of _Exhibit A_ have occurred and are continuing, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 10 business days after the date of this Agreement, Nipro will cause the Acquisition Corporation to commence the Offer in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") thereunder, the " _Securities Exchange Act_ ") and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The Offer will initially expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on the 20th business day following the date of the commencement of the Offer. If the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in _Exhibit A_) is not satisfied at the expiration of 

   ##### 

  

    

the initial Offer period, Nipro will cause the Acquisition Corporation to
extend the Offer for up to two additional 10 business day periods if so
requested in writing by HDI. Nipro may cause the Acquisition Corporation,
without the consent of HDI and in its sole discretion, to extend the Offer
for successive extension periods expiring on or before April 30, 2010 (the "
_End Date_ "), each extension period not exceeding 20 business days, if at
the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the conditions set forth
on  _Exhibit A_ are not satisfied and for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or the
Nasdaq Global Select Market. In addition, Nipro may cause the Acquisition
Corporation, without the consent of HDI and in its sole discretion, to extend
the Offer after acceptance for payment of shares of Common Stock tendered
pursuant to the Offer for a further period of time not to exceed 20 business
days by means of a subsequent offering period pursuant to Rule 14d-11 under
the Securities Exchange Act. 

   

 (c) The obligation of Nipro to cause the Acquisition Corporation to accept for payment and pay for any shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer will be subject to the satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (any of which may be waived by Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation in their sole discretion, except that the Minimum Tender Condition may not be waived) and to the other conditions in this Agreement. Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation expressly reserve the right to modify the terms of the Offer, except that without the consent of HDI, Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation will not (i) reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) modify or add to the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ , (iv) except as provided in Section 1.1(b), extend the Offer, (v) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, or (vi) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Common Stock. Nothing contained in this Section 1.1(c) (but otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) will limit or restrict the ability of Nipro to cause the Acquisition Corporation, and for the Acquisition Corporation, to increase the Offer Price and in connection therewith to extend the period of time during which the Offer remains open for acceptance, including in the case of such Offer Price increase any extension required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. 

   

 (d) On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Nipro will cause the Acquisition Corporation to pay for all shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that the Acquisition Corporation becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable and in any event no more than two business days after the expiration of the Offer. The Acquisition Corporation may, at any time, transfer or assign to one or more subsidiaries of Nipro the right to purchase all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve Nipro or the Acquisition Corporation of its respective obligations under the Offer or prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to receive payment for shares of Common Stock validly tendered and accepted for payment. 

   

 (e) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation will file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which will contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), and will cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Common Stock in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The 

   ##### 

  

    

Offer Documents will comply as to form in all material respects with the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
of the SEC thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "), the Securities Exchange Act
and other applicable laws, rules and regulations. Each of Nipro, the
Acquisition Corporation and HDI agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents or the Offer, and to promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information has become false or misleading in any material respect, each of
Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation will take all steps necessary to amend
or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as so
amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
the holders of shares of Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. HDI and its counsel will be
provided with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents, including any amendment thereto, prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC. Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation will provide HDI and its
counsel in writing with a copy of any written comments and
telephonic notification of any oral comments Nipro, the Acquisition
Corporation or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments
and will provide HDI and its counsel with a copy of any written response and
telephonic notification of any oral response of Nipro, the
Acquisition Corporation or their counsel. 

  

 _Section 1.2. Actions by HDI._ 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, HDI hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and each of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, HDI will file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (as amended from time to time, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") and will mail the Schedule 14D-9 together with the Offer Documents as required by applicable federal securities laws to the holders of shares of Common Stock. The Schedule 14D-9 will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act. HDI will deliver copies of the proposed form of the Schedule 14D-9 to Nipro within a reasonable time prior to the filing thereof with the SEC for review and comment by Nipro and its counsel. Each of Nipro, the Acquisition Corporation and HDI will promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information has become false or misleading in any material respect, and HDI will take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of shares of Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. HDI will provide Nipro and its counsel in writing with a copy of any written comments and telephonic notification of any oral comments that HDI or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and will provide Nipro and its counsel with a copy of any written response and telephonic notification of any oral response of HDI or its counsel. 

   

 (c) Except as expressly permitted in accordance with Section 6.8(c), HDI will include in the Schedule 14D-9 (i) the Recommendation (as defined in Section 4.2(a)) as it pertains to the Offer and (ii) the written opinion of Raymond James and Associates, Inc., 

   ##### 

  

    

financial advisor to the board of directors of HDI (the " _Financial Advisor_

 (a) If requested by Nipro, upon the payment for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to the Offer, Nipro will be entitled to designate such number of directors serving on the board of directors of HDI (and on each committee of HDIs board of directors and the board of directors of each subsidiary of HDI as designated by Nipro) as will give Nipro representation on the board of directors of HDI (or such committee or subsidiary board of directors) equal to at least that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, which is the product of (i) the total number of directors on the HDI board of directors (or such committee or subsidiary board of directors) giving effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence, multiplied by (ii) the percentage that (A) such number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Nipro and its subsidiaries (including all shares of Common Stock purchased by the Acquisition Corporation pursuant to the Offer) bears to (B) the total number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding, and HDI will, at such time, cause Nipros designees to be so appointed or elected; _provided_ that in the event that Nipros designees are appointed or elected to the HDI board of directors, until the Effective Time the HDI board of directors will have at least three directors who are directors on the date of this Agreement and who will be independent for purposes of Rule 10a-3 under the Securities Exchange Act (the " _Independent Directors_ "); _provided further_ that, in such event, if the number of Independent Directors will be reduced below three for any reason whatsoever, any remaining Independent Directors (or Independent Director, if there is only one remaining) will be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who will be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors will designate three persons to fill such vacancies who will be independent for purposes of Rule 10a-3 under the Securities Exchange Act, and such persons will be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Subject to applicable law, HDI will take all action necessary to effect any such election. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) HDI will take all actions necessary to cause the persons designated by Nipro to be directors on the board of directors of HDI (or a committee of the HDI board of directors or the board of directors of subsidiaries of HDI as designated by Nipro) pursuant to Section 1.3(a) to be so appointed or elected (whether, at the request of Nipro, by means of increasing the size of the HDI board of directors (or such committee or subsidiary board of directors) or seeking the resignation of directors and causing Nipros designees to be appointed or elected. 

   

 (c) The obligation of HDI to appoint designees of Nipro to its board of directors will be subject to Section 14(f) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. HDI will promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, and will include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to HDI and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to enable Nipros designees to be elected to the board of directors of HDI. Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation will supply to HDI any information with respect to any of them and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. 

   

 (d) Following the election or appointment of Nipros designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors (or of the sole Independent Director if there is only one Independent Director) will be required for HDI to authorize (and such authorization will constitute the authorization of HDIs board of directors and no other action on the part of HDI, including any action by any other director of HDI, will be required to authorize) any Change in Recommendation, any consent or action by HDI required under this Agreement, including termination of this Agreement by HDI, any amendment of this Agreement or of HDIs certificate of incorporation or bylaws, any extension of the time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Nipro or the Acquisition Corporation, any waiver of compliance with any covenant of Nipro or the Acquisition Corporation or any waiver of any other agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of HDI, any exercise of HDIs rights or remedies under this Agreement or any action seeking to enforce any obligation of Nipro or the Acquisition Corporation under this Agreement.

 _Section 1.4. Top-Up Option._ 

   

 (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 1.4, HDI hereby grants the Acquisition Corporation an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price that number of shares of Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Acquisition Corporation at the time of such exercise, constitutes one share 

   ##### 

  

    

more than 90% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, calculated after
giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. 

   

 (b) The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option may not exceed (i) the number of then authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, or (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued by HDI without the prior approval of its stockholders in accordance with the listing rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Acquisition Corporation will not be permitted to exercise the Top-Up Option if (i) as a result of the foregoing limitations, the number of Top-Up Option Shares, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Acquisition Corporation, would constitute less than 90% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, calculated after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, (ii) any provision of applicable law or any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any governmental authority will prohibit such exercise, or require any action, consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, or filing with or notification to, any governmental authority in connection with such exercise or the delivery of Top-Up Option Shares, if such action, consent, approval, authorization, permit, filing or notification has not theretofore been obtained or made, or (iii) the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(b) and (c) are not satisfied at the time of the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. 

   

 (c) The Top-Up Option may be exercised, in whole but not in part, during the 10 business day period commencing as of date of the Acquisition Corporations acceptance for payment of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (d) If the Acquisition Corporation determines to exercise the Top-Up Option, it will deliver a written notice of exercise to HDI setting forth (i) the number of shares of Common Stock that are expected to be owned by the Acquisition Corporation immediately prior to the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Acquisition Corporations notice will include an undertaking by the Acquisition Corporation to consummate the Merger within three business days after the date of the Top-Up Closing. HDI will, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify the Acquisition Corporation in writing of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable for the shares of Common Stock being purchased by the Acquisition Corporation pursuant to the Top-Up Option will be determined by multiplying the number of such shares then subject to the Top-Up Option by the Offer Price. Such purchase price will be paid by the Acquisition Corporation by paying in cash an amount equal to the aggregate par value of such shares, which will be allocated to HDIs stated (or "paid-in") capital account, and by executing and delivering to HDI a promissory note having a principal amount equal to he balance of such purchase price, which balance will be allocated to HDIs "additional capital" account. Such promissory note will bear interest per annum at the prime lending rate as announced from time to time by JP Morgan Chase and in effect on the date such promissory note is made, will mature and become due and payable on the first business day following the Effective Time and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. At the Top-Up Closing, the Acquisition Corporation will pay HDI the aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares and HDI will cause to be issued to the Acquisition Corporation or its designee a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation acknowledge and agree that the shares of Common Stock that the Acquisition Corporation may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offer. The Acquisition Corporation is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The Acquisition Corporation agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by the Acquisition Corporation for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. 

   

 (f) The Acquisition Corporation agrees that the share certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares may, at HDIs election, include the following legend: 

   

 "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR ANY EXEMPTION THEREFROM." 

  

 _Section 1.5. Approval of Compensation Arrangements_. The compensation committee of HDIs board of directors will grant all approvals and take all other actions required to cause the negotiation, execution and amendment of all employment compensation, severance and other employee benefit arrangements, or payments made or to be made or benefits granted or to be granted according to such arrangements, in connection with or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to be exempt from the provisions of Rule 14d-10(a)(2) in accordance with the safe harbor provisions of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act.

 (v) each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service that it is qualified under Code Section 401(a) and that its related trust is exempt from federal income tax under Code Section 501(a). To HDIs knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that will or could give rise to disqualification or loss of tax-exempt status of any such Plan or trust; 

   

 (vi) the market value of assets under each such Plan which is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan (other than any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or plan that is exempt from the requirements of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA) equals or exceeds the present value of all vested and nonvested liabilities thereunder determined in accordance with Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation methods, factors and assumptions applicable to an employee pension benefit plan terminating on the date for determination.

 (i) no such Employee Pension Benefit Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan) has been completely or partially terminated or been the subject of a reportable event (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) as to which notices would be required to be filed with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and no proceeding by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to terminate such Employee Pension Benefit Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan) has been instituted or, to HDIs knowledge, threatened;

None of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will trigger any withdrawal or termination liability under any Multiemployer Plan. As of the date of this Agreement, the withdrawal liability under all Multiemployer Plans in which HDI or any of it Subsidiaries contributes to would not result in a HDI Material Adverse Effect if triggered simultaneously.

related to any Acquisition Proposal. HDI will be responsible for any act or
omission by any director, officer, employee, financial advisor, attorney,
accountants, consultant or other agent, advisor or representative of HDI or
any of its Subsidiaries that would constitute a breach of the provisions of
this Section 6.8 if taken or omitted to be taken by HDI. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.8(a), subject to providing Nipro with not less than one business days prior written notice of any such action, HDI may engage in discussions or negotiations with, and furnish information and data to, any party that submits an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the date of the acceptance for payment of shares of Common Stock pursuant to, and subject to the conditions of, the Offer (the " _Applicable Period_ ") if (i) the board of directors of HDI determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Financial Advisor or another financial advisory firm of nationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 6.8(h)), (ii) the board of directors of HDI determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the board of directors and (iii) prior to taking any such action, HDI receives from the party submitting such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement containing provisions that are no less favorable to HDI than the provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of August 18, 2009 among HDI, Nipro and Nipro Medical Corporation (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and which permits HDI to perform and comply with its obligations under this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.8(a) but subject to compliance by HDI with the provisions of Section 6.8(d) and Section 8.3, the board of directors of HDI will be permitted to effect a Change in Recommendation if (i) HDI receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the Applicable Period has not expired prior to the date of the Change in Recommendation, (iii) the board of directors of HDI determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and the Financial Advisor or another financial advisory firm of nationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Acquisition Proposal (after taking into account any changes in the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Nipro in accordance with Section 6.8(d)) and (iv) the board of directors of HDI determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the board of directors. 

   

 (d) HDI will provide Nipro with not less than four business days prior written notice of its intention to effect a Change in Recommendation. HDIs notice will include the identity of the acquiring party, a copy of the most recent version of any written agreement relating to the Superior Acquisition Proposal resulting in such proposed Change in Recommendation. If requested by Nipro after the delivery of such notice, HDI, together with its legal and financial advisors, will engage in reasonable, good faith negotiations with 

   ##### 

  

   

Nipro regarding any modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement proposed by Nipro. If Nipro agrees (subject to acceptance by HDI)
to any such modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement prior
to the expiration of the four business day period following delivery of HDIs
notice, HDI may not effect a Change in Recommendation unless and until the
board of directors of HDI determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors of nationally recognized
reputation, that the Acquisition Proposal resulting in the proposed Changed
in Recommendation continues to constitute a Superior Acquisition Proposal,
after taking into account any changes in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement agreed to (subject to acceptance by HDI) by Nipro in accordance
with this Section 6.8(d). If any material modifications are made to the terms
and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal after the date notice thereof is
provided by HDI to Nipro pursuant to this Section 6.8(d), then HDI will again
be required to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.8(d) with respect
to such modified Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (e) HDI will within 24 hours after its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal provide Nipro with a copy of such Acquisition Proposal or, in connection with any non-written Acquisition Proposal, a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the acquiring party. HDI will promptly inform Nipro of the status and content of any discussions or negotiations involving any Acquisition Proposal. In connection with any determination by the board of directors of HDI that a Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Acquisition Proposal, HDI will within 24 hours after the making of such determination provide Nipro with a written summary in reasonable detail of the reasons for such determination together with copies of all related resolutions of the board of directors of HDI and all opinions, reports and analyses rendered or prepared by HDIs legal and financial advisors that were reviewed by the board of directors of HDI in making such determination. If HDI provides any non-public information to any party submitting an Acquisition Proposal that has not previously been provided to Nipro, HDI will provide a copy of such information to Nipro within 24 hours after the time it is first provided to such other party. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.8 or this Agreement will prohibit HDI or its board of directors, in connection with any unsolicited Acquisition Proposal publicly announced during the Applicable Period, from (i) taking and disclosing to HDIs stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act, it being understood that a "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of HDI pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Securities Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the stockholders of HDI) will not be deemed to be or constitute a Change in Recommendation, (ii) complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Securities Exchange Act, (iii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of HDI (after consultation with outside legal counsel), failure to so disclose is inconsistent with applicable law or (iv) informing any person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 6.8. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by HDI that describes HDIs receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not be deemed a withdrawal or modification, or proposal by the board of directors of HDI to withdraw or modify, the Recommendation, an adoption or recommendation with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, or a Change in Recommendation. In complying with the laws and rules referenced in this Section 6.8(f), neither HDI nor its board of directors or any committee thereof may take, or agree or resolve to take, any action otherwise prohibited under this 

   ##### 

  

   

Section 6.8, except if, and then solely to the extent that, the board of
directors of HDI (after consultation with outside legal counsel) determines
in good faith that the failure to take, or to agree or resolve to take, such
action would result in a violation of such laws or rules. 

   

 (g) The term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " as used in this Agreement means any proposal, whether or not in writing, made by a party to acquire beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13(d) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act) of 15% or more of the assets of HDI and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (based on fair market value, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of HDI) or a 15% or greater equity interest in HDI or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender or exchange offer, Intellectual Property licensing transaction or similar transaction involving HDI or any of its Subsidiaries, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions that is structured to permit such party to acquire beneficial ownership of such percentage of the assets of, or such a percentage equity interest in, HDI or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (h) The term " _Superior Acquisition Proposal_ " as used in this Agreement means an unsolicited written proposal made by a party to acquire beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13(d) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act) of 80% or more of the assets of HDI and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (based on fair market value, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of HDI) or a 80% or greater equity interest in HDI or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender or exchange offer, Intellectual Property licensing transaction or similar transaction involving HDI or any of its Subsidiaries, that the board of directors of HDI determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and the Financial Advisor or another financial advisory firm of nationally recognized reputation and taking into account such matters deemed relevant in good faith by the board of directors, (i) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, and (ii) is more favorable to HDI and its stockholders than the Offer and the Merger. 

  

 _Section 6.9. Indemnification._ 

   

 (a) From and after the Closing Date, Nipro, subject to the limits imposed by the Delaware Act, will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors and executive officers of HDI and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all losses, claims, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) arising out of or relating to actions or omissions, or alleged actions or omissions, occurring at or prior to the Closing Date to the same extent and subject to the same terms and conditions (including with respect to the advancement of expenses) provided in HDIs certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Any determination required to be made with respect to whether any Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification will, if requested by such Indemnified Party, be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. 

   

 (c) Without limiting any additional rights that any person may have under any agreement, from and after the payment for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, subject to the limits imposed by the Delaware Act, Nipro will, and will cause HDI and the 

   ##### 

  

   

Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party,
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries,
fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of, pertaining to or in connection with the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary
or agent of HDI, or of another entity if such service was at the request of
or for the benefit of HDI, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, including with respect to all actions taken and omitted
to be taken in connection with the approval, recommendation, negotiation,
execution and consummation of this Agreement, the Merger, the Offer and all
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. In the event of any such
proceeding, each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of the proceeding from Nipro, HDI or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law (provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced will
have provided an undertaking to repay such advances if it is finally
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification), and Nipro
will, and will cause HDI and the Surviving Corporation to, provide such
advancement of expenses. Nipro, HDI and the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Parties in the
defense of any such matter. 

   

 (d) With respect to which any matter in connection with which any Indemnified Party is or may be entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this 6.9 (i) each counsel selected to represent the Indemnified Parties will be reasonably acceptable to Nipro, (ii) Nipro, HDI and the Surviving Corporation will not be responsible for indemnifying or advancing the fees or expenses of more than one counsel (plus local counsel, if reasonably required) to represent all of the Indemnified Parties in connection with such matter, (iii) none of the Indemnified Parties will agree to any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or award in connection with such matter without the prior written consent of Nipro (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (iv) neither Nipro, HDI, the Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates will agree to any settlement or compromise of such matter or consent to the entry of any judgment or award in connection with such matter unless the terms of such settlement, compromise, judgment or award include a full and complete discharge and release of each Indemnified Party that is a party or has been threatened in writing to be made a party to such matter. 

   

 (e) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Nipro will cause to be maintained in effect the policies of directors and officers liability insurance currently maintained by HDI for the persons presently covered by such policies with respect to claims arising from or relating to actions or omissions, or alleged actions or omissions, occurring on or prior to the Closing Date. Nipro may at its discretion substitute for such policies currently maintained by HDI directors and officers liability insurance policies with reputable and financially sound carriers providing for substantially similar coverage so long as such substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.9(e), Nipro will not be obligated to make annual premium payments with respect to such policies of insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 250 percent of the annual premiums paid by HDI as of the date of this Agreement. If the annual premium costs necessary to maintain such insurance coverage exceed the foregoing amount, Nipro will maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers liability insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the foregoing amount. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) In the event Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns the Surviving Corporation will assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9. 

   

 (g) The obligations of Nipro or the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.9 will not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended for the benefit of and will be enforceable by each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs, executors and legal representatives. 

   

 (h) In the event that the Surviving Corporation should fail, an any time to comply with any of the foregoing obligations set forth in this Section 6.9, for any reason, Nipro will be responsible therefore and hereby agrees to perform such obligations unconditionally without regard to any defense or other basis for nonperformance which the Surviving Corporation may have or claim (except any claim that performance is prohibited by applicable Delaware law), it being the intention of this Section 6.9 that the Indemnified Parties will be fully indemnified and that the provisions of this Section 6.9 be a primary obligation of Nipro and not merely a guarantee by Nipro of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 _Section 6.10. Employee Matters._ 

   

 (a) For the period from the Effective Time through December 31, 2010, Nipro will provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to employees of HDI and HDIs Subsidiaries who remain in the employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") (i) salary and incentive opportunities that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such employees by HDI or HDI Subsidiaries during the 12-month period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such employees by HDI or HDI Subsidiaries during the 12-month period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of clause (i) above, the value of any equity or equity-based compensation paid or payable by HDI to the Continuing Employees, and any bonuses or other compensation paid or payable to any Continuing Employee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will be disregarded. Neither Nipro nor any of its Subsidiaries will have any obligation to provide equity or equity-based compensation to any Continuing Employee. 

   

 (b) To the extent that any employee benefit plan of Nipro or its subsidiaries is made available to any Continuing Employee, on or following the Effective Time, Nipro will cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with HDI and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (as well as service with any predecessor employer of HDI or any of its Subsidiaries), to the extent such service was recognized by HDI or such Subsidiary for similar or analogous purposes prior to the Effective Time (such service, " _Pre-Closing Service_ ") for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals; _provided_ that Pre-Closing Service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service. 

   

 (c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Nipro or any of its Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employee commences to participate after the 

   ##### 

  

   

Effective Time, Nipro will and will cause the Surviving Corporation to (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did
not apply to such employees under the welfare plans of HDI and HDI
Subsidiaries prior to such commencement of participation and (ii) provide
each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
in the plan year of such commencement of participation in satisfying any
analogous deductible or out-of-pocket maximum requirements to the extent
applicable under any such plan. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee of HDI or any of its Subsidiaries or any other individual associated therewith (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) will be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Section 9.10 with respect to Section 6.9), and no provision of this Section 6.10 will create such rights in any such persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Plan or any employee program or any plan or arrangement of Nipro or any of its subsidiaries. No provision of this Section 6.10 will be construed to limit the right of Nipro or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time. 

  

 _Section 6.11. Public Announcements_. Nipro and HDI will consult with one another before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except as may be required by applicable law or by the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and will not issue any such press release or make any such announcement prior to such consultation. 

  

 _Section 6.12. Actions Regarding Antitakeover Statutes_. If any fair price, moratorium, control share acquisition or other form of antitakeover statute, rule or regulation is or becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the board of directors of HDI will grant such approvals and take such other actions as may be required so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 6.13. Standstill Provisions._ 

   

 (a) If the board of directors of HDI, upon the request of Nipro or the Acquisition Corporation, determines to grant any waivers of the restrictions on Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation contained in Section 13 of the Confidentiality Agreement, HDI will be permitted to simultaneously amend the terms of all then-existing confidentiality agreements with third parties to the extent necessary such that no one such confidentiality agreement is more or less restrictive of the other party thereto than any other confidentiality agreement (including the Confidentiality Agreement). 

   

 (b) If HDI is party as of the date of this Agreement to a written confidentiality agreement with any third party other than Nipro that includes a provision that restricts the ability of such third party to submit to the board of directors of HDI or make a public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal without the prior written approval of HDI, HDI will be permitted to waive such provision in the event that HDI receives an unsolicited request from such third party during the Applicable Period to submit a written Acquisition Proposal to the board of directors of HDI. Such waiver may be granted solely to the extent 

   ##### 

  

   

reasonably required to permit such third party to submit such Acquisition
Proposal to the board of directors of HDI. 

   

 (c) If an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal is made during the Applicable Period by a third party which is party to a confidentiality agreement with HDI entered into prior to the date of this Agreement that would prohibit HDI from complying with any of the terms of Section 6.8(d) or Section 6.8(e) requiring the provision by HDI of information, agreements or documents to Nipro, HDI will use its reasonable best efforts to, and will be permitted to, amend such confidentiality agreement with such third party to allow HDI to fully comply with such terms of Section 6.8(d) and Section 6.8(e) without violating such confidentiality agreement. HDI will not engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information or data to, or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement with any such third party that does not agree to the foregoing amendment of its confidentiality agreement with HDI. 

   

 (d) The Confidentiality Agreement will terminate as of the Effective Time. 

  

 _Section 6.14. Defense of Claims, Orders and Injunctions_. In the event HDI becomes subject to any claim, action, suit or proceeding in connection with which the plaintiff or claimant (including any governmental authority) seeks to restrict or prohibit the consummation of, or seeks damages or other payments in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, HDI will use its reasonable best efforts to defend against and obtain the dismissal of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. HDI will, and will cause its legal counsel to, cooperate with Nipro and its legal counsel in connection with the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding and, without the prior written consent of Nipro (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), will not enter into any settlement or other resolution of such matter which calls for aggregate payments by HDI and its Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000 or which otherwise imposes a material restriction or limitation or materially burdensome requirement on the conduct of the business of HDI or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time. In the event either party becomes subject to any order or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction which restricts or prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to overturn or lift such order or injunction. The foregoing will not be deemed to require Nipro to enter into any agreement, consent decree or other commitment requiring Nipro or any of its Subsidiaries to divest (including through the grant of a license) or hold separate any assets (including any assets of HDI or its Subsidiaries) or to take any other action that would have a Nipro Material Adverse Effect or HDI Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 _Section 6.15. Nipro Guarantee_. Nipro agrees to take all action necessary to cause the Acquisition Corporation to perform all of Acquisition Corporations, and the Surviving Corporation to perform all of Surviving Corporations, agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Nipro will be liable for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Acquisition Corporation and for any breach of this covenant.

 (a) HDI will pay Nipro, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of $6,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") if this Agreement is terminated under the following circumstances: 

   

 (i) if Nipro terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i), (ii) or (iii), HDI will pay the Termination Fee to Nipro on the second business day after the date of such termination; or 

   

 (ii) if HDI terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i), HDI will pay the Termination Fee to Nipro prior to or concurrently with the date of such termination.

   #####

fees) incurred by Nipro and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (c) If HDI terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), Nipro will reimburse HDI, not later than two business days after submission of statements therefor, for up to an aggregate of $1,000,000 of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys, accountants and investment bankers fees and expenses, printing and mailing expenses, advertising expenses, and HSR Act and other filing fees) incurred by HDI and its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement will terminate as at the Effective Time or upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, as the case may be, except that the representations and warranties of HDI will expire upon the purchase by the Acquisition Corporation of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 _Section 9.2. Remedies; Specific Enforcement_. Any party having any rights under any provision of this Agreement will have all rights and remedies set forth in this Agreement and all rights and remedies that such party may have been granted at any time under any other agreement 

   ##### 

  

 

or contract and all of the rights that such party may have under applicable
law. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. 

   

 _Section 9.3. Successors and Assigns_. No party hereto may assign or delegate any of such partys rights or obligations under or in connection with this Agreement without the written consent of the other party hereto. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto or thereto will be binding upon and enforceable against the respective successors and assigns of such party and will be enforceable by and will inure to the benefit of the respective successors and permitted assigns of such party. 

  

 _Section 9.4. Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the execution and delivery of a written instrument by or on behalf of Nipro, the Acquisition Corporation and HDI at any time before or after the adoption and approval of the Merger by the stockholders of HDI or the Acquisition Corporation; _provided_ that after the date of the adoption and approval of the Merger by the stockholders of HDI, no amendment to this Agreement will be made without the approval of stockholders of HDI to the extent such approval is required under the Delaware Act. 

  

 _Section 9.5. Extension and Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may extend the time for performance of or waive compliance with any of the covenants or agreements of the other parties to this Agreement and may waive any breach of the representations or warranties of such other parties. No agreement extending or waiving any provision of this Agreement will be valid or binding unless it is in writing and is executed and delivered by or on behalf of the party against which it is sought to be enforced. 

  

 _Section 9.6. Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 9.7. Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same Agreement. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email transmission that includes a copy of the sending partys signature(s) is as effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person. 

  

 _Section 9.8. Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT A 

   

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER 

   

 1. Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, the Acquisition Corporation will not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Securities Exchange Act, pay for any shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer unless (a) there has been validly tendered (including by notice of guaranteed delivery) and not withdrawn prior to the time of the expiration of the Offer (including any extensions thereof in accordance with Section 1.1(b) of this Agreement, the " _Determination Time_ ") that number of shares of Common Stock which represents, together with all other shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation, a majority in voting power of the Fully Diluted Shares (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ") and (b) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act has terminated or expired. The term " _Fully Diluted Shares_ " means all outstanding securities entitled generally to vote in the election of directors of HDI on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the exercise, conversion or exchange of all options, warrants, rights and securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into such voting securities. 

  

 2. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, the Acquisition Corporation will not be required to accept for payment or to pay for any shares of Common Stock not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for, and, subject to Section 1.1(b) of this Agreement, may terminate or amend the Offer, if at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and before the acceptance of any such shares of Common Stock for payment or the payment therefor, any of the following conditions exists: 

   

 (a) any consent, authorization, order and approval of or filing with any third party, governmental commission, board or other regulatory authority required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has not been obtained or made, except where the failure to obtain or make such consent, authorization, order, approval or filing would not, from and after the Determination Time, have a HDI Material Adverse Effect or Nipro Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (b) one or more of the parties to this Agreement is subject to any (i) pending or threatened (in writing) claim, action, suit or proceeding by any governmental authority in connection with which the plaintiff or claimant seeks to restrict or prohibit the consummation of, or seeks material damages or other material payments in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) pending claim, action, suit or proceeding by any party other than a governmental authority in connection with which the plaintiff or claimant seeks to materially restrict or prohibit the consummation of, or seeks material damages or other material payments in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case to the extent that Nipro determines in good faith that (A) there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse outcome or result in connection with such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (B) such adverse outcome or result would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations or results of operations of Nipro, HDI or their respective Subsidiaries, or (iii) statute, law, rule or regulation or any judgment, decree, order or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction which prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) any of the representations and warranties of HDI set forth in Section 4.4(a), (b) or (e) of this Agreement is not true and correct in all respects other than de minimis inaccuracies as of the Determination Time as though made on and as of the Determination Time; 

   

 (d) any of the other representations and warranties of HDI set forth in Article 4 (read without any materiality or material adverse effect qualifications, other than the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.8, which will be read with a material adverse effect qualification) are not true and correct of the Determination Time as though made on and as of the Determination Time (except for representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date on or prior to the date of this Agreement, which representations and warranties will have been true and correct as of such date), except for failures of such representations and warranties to be true and correct that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a HDI Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (e) HDI has failed to perform and comply in all material respects with its obligations under this Agreement required to be performed by it at or prior to the Determination Time (or has not cured in all material respects any failure to so perform and comply at or prior to the Determination Time); 

   

 (f) there has been publicly disclosed or Nipro has otherwise become aware that beneficial ownership (determined as set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act) of more than 15% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock has been acquired by another person or entity (including any group as defined in the Securities Exchange Act), unless such shares have been duly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn as of the Determination Time; 

   

 (g) a Change in Recommendation has occurred; or 

   

 (h) this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms; 

  

 which, in the sole judgment of Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation, in any such case, and regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition (including any action or inaction by Nipro, the Acquisition Corporation or any of their affiliates), makes it inadvisable to proceed with such acceptance for payment or payment. 

  

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation and may be asserted by Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such condition or may be waived by Nipro and the Acquisition Corporation in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion, except that the Minimum Tender Condition may not be waived. The failure by Nipro, the Acquisition Corporation or any of their affiliates at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances will not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right will be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
