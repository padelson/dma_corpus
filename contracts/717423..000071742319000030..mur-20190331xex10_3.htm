 \t\t\tand in each case where the subject matter of that written
correspondence or oral disclosure is within the stated technical expertise or
functional role of one or more of such individuals receiving the relevant
written correspondence or oral disclosure (as the case may be); or  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vi) has been actually known to any member of Purchaser\'s
Knowledge Group prior to the Signing Date, including knowledge as a result of
any due diligence investigation by Purchaser or any Purchaser's
Representative.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Seller shall not be liable for a Claim or Excluded Claim if and
to the extent that: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) such Claim arises or is increased as a result of the passing
of, or any change (including any retrospective change) in, the interpretation
of, any law or regulation, or in the administrative practice, of any
Governmental Entity or regulatory body enacted after or coming into effect
after (A) with respect to any Claim under any warranty in Sections 7.3 to
7.17, the Signing Date; and (B) in all other cases, the Effective Date; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) the Loss attributable to such Claim has been recovered by
Purchaser under any other term of this Agreement or any other document
referred to herein or to the extent that the subject of the Claim has been or
is made good or is otherwise compensated for without cost to Purchaser and
accordingly Purchaser may only recover once in respect of the same Loss;
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) the matter is provided or reserved for in the Commercial
Adjustment, the Closing Statement, the Working Capital Adjustment or the
Locked Box Accounts; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) it arises or is increased as a result of any voluntary act or
omission of Purchaser or Purchaser Group save where such act or omission (i)
is required by any applicable laws; (ii) is taken pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or any other agreement entered into between the Parties in
connection with this Agreement; (iii) is carried out on its behalf by or under
direction of or with the written consent of a member of the Seller Group; or
(iv) occurs pursuant to an obligation entered into by a Sale Company including
the Material Contracts, the Material Agreements or the Joint Account Contracts
prior to the Locked Box Accounts Date; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(v) the Loss results from the denial of cost recovery by PETRONAS
for any expenditure made by a Sale Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) All matters, facts and circumstances Fairly Disclosed to
Purchaser or any of Purchaser\'s Representatives apply to each of the
warranties given by Seller (excluding the Fundamental Warranties except in
accordance with Section 7.1(d)) and Purchaser agrees that it shall not, and
shall procure that Purchaser\'s Representatives shall not, be entitled to
claim that any fact, matter or circumstance has not been disclosed to it by
reason of any fact, matter or circumstance Fairly Disclosed not being
specifically related to any particular warranty. Accordingly, such warranties
given by Seller are made and given subject to all matters, facts and
circumstances Fairly Disclosed to Purchaser or any of Purchaser\'s
Representatives and all matters, facts and circumstances Fairly Disclosed
shall apply to all such warranties given by Seller and shall not be limited in
any way to any specific warranty. \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Save in respect of any indemnity relating to Taxation in
Exhibit 6 (Taxation), in calculating the liability of Seller under this
Agreement (i) there shall be taken into account the extent to which
Purchaser\'s rights to Crude Oil or Natural Gas will be increased as a result
of the matter giving rise to such liability qualifying for cost recovery under
the PSCs; and (ii) Taxation will be increased as a result of the increase
referred to in paragraph (i) of this Section 11.2(d). The effect of the events
in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this provision shall be determined by reference
to the economic value of such effects having regard to their likely timing,
the time value of money and the probability of their occurrence. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Purchaser confirms to Seller that, prior to the Signing Date,
no member of the Purchaser's Knowledge Group has knowledge of any breach of
any warranty given by Seller under Section 7. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.3 Right of Recovery \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) If Purchaser or any member of Purchaser Group has a right of
recovery (whether by insurance, payment, discount, credit, relief or
otherwise) against a person, including any Other Participant or PETRONAS or an
insurer, in respect (in whole or in part) of a matter which has given rise to
a Claim or Excluded Claim (a "Right of Recovery"), Purchaser shall: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) notify Seller of the Right of Recovery as soon as reasonably
practicable following it coming to the notice of Purchaser or any member of
Purchaser Group (provided that delay in notice shall only relieve Seller of
any liability to the extent the liability is increased);  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) to the extent within its control, seek to exercise each Right
of Recovery; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) keep Seller reasonably informed of the material progress and
provide Seller with copies of all material correspondence and
documentation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If and to the extent that Purchaser or any member of Purchaser
Group has a Right of Recovery and Purchaser actually recovers an amount from
such third party, the amount of the Claim or Excluded Claim shall be reduced
to the extent of the amount recovered (less any reasonable out of pocket
expenses incurred by Purchaser or any member of Purchaser Group in recovering
the amount and any Tax attributable to or suffered in respect of the amount
recovered). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) If Seller pays an amount to Purchaser in respect of a Claim or
Excluded Claim and Purchaser or any member of Purchaser Group subsequently
recovers from a third party including an insurer, any Other Participant or
PETRONAS an amount which relates (in whole or in part) to the matter that gave
rise to such claim, Purchaser shall notify Seller of that fact and the amount
recovered and: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) if the amount paid by Seller to Purchaser is less than the
amount recovered from the third party, Purchaser must pay Seller an amount
equal to the amount that Seller paid to Purchaser (less any reasonable out of
pocket expenses incurred by Purchaser or any member of Purchaser Group in
recovering the amount and any Tax attributable to or suffered in respect of
the amount recovered); and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) if the amount paid by Seller to Purchaser is more than the
amount recovered from the third party, Purchaser must pay Seller an amount
equal to the amount recovered from the third party (less any reasonable out of
pocket expenses  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t62  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

incurred by Purchaser or any member of Purchaser Group in recovering the
amount and any Tax attributable to or suffered in respect of the amount
recovered). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.4 Thresholds and Aggregate Amounts of Seller\'s Liability \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Seller shall only be liable for any Losses arising out of a
Claim if and to the extent the Loss with respect to an individual Claim
exceeds an amount of US$[*****] (exclusive of legal fees), and then only be
liable if all recoverable Losses for any such Claims (excluding any Claims
below US$[*****] (exclusive of legal fees)) exceed an aggregate amount of
US$[*****] (in which case Seller shall be liable for the full amount of all
such Claims and not only the excess amount above US$[*****]).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Subject to Section 11.4(c) and Section 11.4(d), Seller\'s
aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
including for all Claims (other than those arising out of or in connection
with a breach of the Fundamental Warranties), shall be limited to an aggregate
amount equal to [*****]. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Seller's aggregate liability arising out of or in connection
with all claims for indemnification pursuant to Section [*****] and Exhibit 6
(Taxation), shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to [*****]. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Seller\'s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection
with a breach of the Fundamental Warranties shall, together with Seller\'s
liability arising in respect of all other Claims, Excluded Claims and all
claims of whatever kind under this Agreement, be limited to an aggregate
amount equal to [*****]. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.5 Limitation Periods \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) All claims of Purchaser under or in connection with this
Agreement shall be time-barred upon expiration of the following periods and
Seller shall have no liability in respect of any claim unless written notice
of such claim in accordance with Section 11.6(a) shall have been given by
Purchaser to Seller: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) in the case of any Claim (other than a Claim under the
Fundamental Warranties, the warranties set forth in Section 7.13
(Environmental Matters) and the warranties set forth in Section 7.14 (Tax)),
by not later than [*****] after the Closing Date; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) in the case of any Claim under the Fundamental Warranties and
any Claim under the warranties set forth in Section 7.13 (Environmental
Matters), by not later than [*****] after the Closing Date; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) in the case of any Claim under the warranties set forth in
Section 7.14 (Tax), by not later than [*****] after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations applicable to the underlying liability;
and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) in the case of Sellers' indemnity contained in Section
[*****], by not later than the date which is [*****] after the Closing
Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Subject to Sections 11.3 and 11.6(a), with respect to a Claim
or Excluded Claim (other than Seller's indemnity contained in paragraph 1 of
Exhibit 6 (Taxation) in respect of which the provisions in Exhibit 6
(Taxation) shall apply), any limitation period arising pursuant to this
Agreement shall be suspended only if and as long as a notice of claim is
timely filed with SIAC in accordance with Section 14.9 within nine (9) months
after notice has been given by Purchaser in accordance with Section
11.6(a). \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Section 11,
Seller shall have no liability to Purchaser in respect of any contingent
liability, and Purchaser shall not be entitled to make a Claim under this
Agreement in respect of any contingent liability, until such time as it
becomes an actual liability and is due and payable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.6 Compensation Procedures \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) In the event that Purchaser becomes aware of any breach of a
warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement (other
than Seller's indemnity contained in paragraph 1 of Exhibit 6 (Taxation) in
respect of which the provisions in Exhibit 6 (Taxation) shall apply) that may
result in a claim being made by Purchaser under this Agreement, Purchaser
shall promptly (and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days, provided
that delay in notice shall only relieve Seller of any liability to the extent
the liability is increased) notify Seller of such breach in writing, describe
its claim in reasonable detail and provide relevant information in its
possession in relation to such claim to Seller in order to enable Seller to
review and assess whether a breach has occurred and, to the extent then
feasible, set forth the estimated amount of such claim (including, to the
extent possible, its calculation of the Loss thereby alleged to have been
suffered by it). Seller shall have the right to remedy the breach within sixty
(60) days following such notice, and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with
and assist Seller in such remedy. Any applicable limitation period arising
pursuant to this Agreement shall be suspended during such sixty (60)-day
period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) In the event that any action, claim, demand or proceeding that
may result in a claim being made by Purchaser under this Agreement is asserted
or announced by any third party (including any Governmental Entity) against
Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate (other than Seller's indemnity contained
in paragraph 1 of Exhibit 6 (Taxation) in respect of which the provisions in
Exhibit 6 (Taxation) shall apply) (a "Third Party Claim"), Purchaser agrees,
and shall cause all Purchaser Affiliates, (i) as soon as practicable upon
becoming aware (and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days, provided
that delay in notice shall only relieve Seller of any liability to the extent
the liability is increased or Seller is prejudiced in its ability to defend
the Third Party Claim) to notify Seller by written notice of such Third Party
Claim, (ii) to permit Seller and Seller\'s Representatives to participate in
all meetings, discussions and correspondence with the third party, (iii) to
promptly provide Seller with copies of any correspondence received from or
sent to any third party in connection with the Third Party Claim, (including
any questions or information requests by any competent court or authority),
(iv) to provide Seller access, upon reasonable advance notice and during
normal business hours, to all relevant books and records, other information,
premises and personnel and (v) not to provide the third party with
information, nor to acknowledge or settle the Third Party Claim, nor to agree
to any allegations or findings of the relevant third party or otherwise to
concede any fact or circumstance without Seller\'s prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) In addition, subject to Purchaser being indemnified by Seller
against any reasonable costs, losses and expenses (i) incurred by Purchaser
prior to the Seller assuming conduct of any claim pursuant to this Section
11.6(c) and (ii) which are subsequently incurred by Purchaser as a result of
any act or omission of Seller in relation to the liability or alleged
liability to the third party asserting such claim. Seller shall have the
right, at any time during the proceedings, to assume the control of the
defence of the Third Party Claim. In such case, Seller may defend the claim by
all appropriate actions and shall have the sole power to direct and control
such defence. In particular, (i) Seller may appoint and instruct counsel (who
shall be empowered by Purchaser or the relevant Sale Company by such documents
as reasonably requested by Seller) and (ii) Purchaser agrees, and shall cause
each Sale Company, to litigate or settle the Third Party Claim  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tin accordance with Seller\'s instructions and to comply with any other
directions of Seller in relation to the defence of the Third Party Claim.
Purchaser shall, and shall cause each Sale Company to, provide such assistance
as Seller may reasonably require in the defence of any Third Party
Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Seller shall not be liable for a claim to the extent that a
Loss in connection with such claim arises or is increased as a result of the
failure by Purchaser to comply with its obligations under Section 11.6(b) or
11.6(c). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) No action by Seller or Seller\'s Representatives in connection
with the defence of any Third Party Claim shall be construed as an
acknowledgement (whether express or implied) of Purchaser\'s claim under this
Agreement or of any underlying facts related to such claim.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Seller and Purchaser shall ensure that any information
exchanged under or in connection with this Section 11.6 shall only be used by
the respective other Party for the purpose of this Agreement and is kept
confidential with respect to all other purposes in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) To the extent that any information exchanged under or in
connection with this Section 11.6 is privileged: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) no privilege shall be waived by reason of or as a result of its
being exchanged under or in connection with this Section 11.6; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) if a third party requests disclosure by the recipient of that
information, the recipient shall or, if the recipient is an Affiliate of a
Party, the relevant Party shall procure that the recipient shall, promptly
notify the provider of the information and, to the extent it can do so, itself
assert privilege in opposition to that disclosure request. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.7 Benefit \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSubject to Section 14.7(b), the rights of Purchaser to make or bring a
claim are personal to Purchaser and may not be assigned or otherwise
transferred to any other person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.8 No Additional Rights or Remedies \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Purchaser agrees that its sole rights and remedies with respect
to any Claim shall be damages, and that such damages shall be subject to any
and all limitations set out in this Agreement and that Purchaser expressly
waives any and all other rights and remedies in respect of any Claim save for
those specifically provided for in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Parties agree that any and all warranties given in Sections 4.4(a), 7.3
to 7.17 are given solely as a warranty and are not given as representations
nor, except as provided in Section 4.4(a), do they constitute an indemnity or
covenant to pay in respect of any loss arising as a result of a breach of any
warranty, as such, damages in respect of any breach of a warranty shall be
assessed in a manner consistent with this position and not on an indemnity
basis, and in any event and at all times subject to the limitations set out in
this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) No Party shall have any right to rescind, cancel or otherwise
terminate this Agreement or exercise any right or remedy which would have a
similar effect, except for the termination rights set forth in Section
12. \t\t

Termination \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.1 Termination Rights \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) This Agreement may only be terminated prior to Closing and, in
such circumstances, by written notice to the other Party given within five (5)
Business Days after the termination right has arisen, as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) by either Party if Closing has not occurred by the Longstop
Date; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) by either Party pursuant to Section 6.3(c) without any further
reminder or prior notice being required; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) by either Party, if Carigali or Pertamina validly exercises
its pre-emptive rights listed in Section 5.1(a)(i) or 5.1(a)(ii); or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) by Purchaser, if a MAE Notice is delivered to Seller by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 12.2(a) and: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(A) Seller does not notify Purchaser that it disagrees that a
Material Adverse Effect has occurred within the time period specified in
Section 12.2(b); or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(B) the Independent Expert determines, in accordance with Sections
12.2(c) to 12.2(h) (inclusive), that a Material Adverse Effect has
occurred. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tOther than as set out above, neither Party shall have a right
(including any right under common law or any right in respect of a Claim,
other than in the case of fraud) to delay or defer Closing, either before or
after Closing, to rescind or terminate or fail to perform this Agreement and
shall not be entitled to treat the other Party as having repudiated this
Agreement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.2 Termination by Purchaser for a Material Adverse Effect \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) If before Closing Purchaser considers that a Material Adverse
Effect has occurred, Purchaser shall be entitled to notify Seller of the same
(such notice a "MAE Notice"). Any MAE Notice shall include reasonable details
as to why Purchaser considers that such Material Adverse Effect has
occurred. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If, within twenty (20) Business Days after a MAE Notice has
been delivered by Purchaser, Seller notifies Purchaser that it disagrees that
a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or is subsisting, the issue of whether
a Material Adverse Effect has occurred shall be referred by Seller and
Purchaser to an independent expert (the "Independent Expert") for
determination. The Independent Expert shall be appointed and shall carry out
an expert determination in accordance with Sections 12.2(c) to 12.2(h)
(inclusive). The expert determination shall be conducted, and the Independent
Expert\'s decision shall be written, in the English language. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Independent Expert shall be a barrister who has been called
to the Bar of England and Wales for at least fifteen (15) years and with
experience in handling disputes arising from corporate transactions in the oil
and gas industry, the identity of whom shall be agreed between Seller and
Purchaser or, failing such agreement within ten (10) Business Days of the
initial notification by Seller or Purchaser to the other of its intention to
make a reference to the Independent Expert pursuant to this Section
12.2, \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t shall be a barrister satisfying the requirements set out above who is
appointed by the President for the time being of The Law Society of England
and Wales (the "Appointing Authority") on the written application of either
Seller or Purchaser. Prior to his appointment, the Independent Expert shall
declare all current and past associations with either Party and confirm that
he is impartial, independent and not aware of any conflicts of interest. The
Independent Expert shall endeavour to make his determination (the
"Determination") as to whether or not a Material Adverse Effect has occurred
within twenty (20) Business Days but no later than thirty (30) Business Days
from the date of his appointment, provided that failure to do so shall not
invalidate the Determination. The Independent Expert shall act as an expert
and not as an arbitrator and the Arbitration Act 1996 shall not apply. The
Determination shall: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) be in writing; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) state the reasons upon which it is based; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) in the absence of fraud or manifest error, be final and
binding on the Parties for all purposes of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) If the Independent Expert dies, resigns or becomes unwilling or
incapable of acting or fails to reach a determination, either Party may apply
to the Appointing Authority to discharge the Independent Expert and appoint a
replacement Independent Expert with the required expertise pursuant to the
abovementioned procedure.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Insofar as the Independent Expert considers necessary for the
purposes of determining whether or not a Material Adverse Effect has occurred,
the Independent Expert shall be entitled to: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) take into consideration and interpret any provision of this
Agreement; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) in the absence of agreement between Seller and Purchaser,
determine the procedure to be followed by the Independent Expert, insofar as
such procedure is not set out herein; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) request comments, data, information, documents and/or
submissions to enable him to make his Determination, and Seller and Purchaser
shall comply promptly with such requests. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAll comments, data, information, documents and submissions provided to
the Independent Expert in writing by Seller or Purchaser shall be copied
simultaneously to the other Party. All matters concerning the process and the
result of the determination by the Independent Expert shall be kept
confidential among the parties and the Independent Expert. Each Party shall
act reasonably and co-operate fully in the expeditious conduct of such expert
determination and otherwise knowingly do anything to hinder or prevent the
Independent Expert from reaching their determination. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) The Independent Expert may instruct valuers and/or other
professional advisers to the extent that he considers it necessary to do so in
order to make the Determination. Each Party shall bear the costs and expenses
of all advisers, witnesses and employees retained by it for the purposes of
the Determination. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert (including
the reasonable fees and expenses of any valuers and/or other professional
advisers duly instructed by him) and any fees payable to the Appointing
Authority shall be borne between Seller on the one hand and Purchaser on the
other hand in equal shares unless the Independent Expert otherwise
determines. \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) The Independent Expert may, at the request of Seller or
Purchaser or on his own motion, require statements or appearances by Party
witnesses. No meeting between the Independent Expert and a Party shall take
place unless both Seller and Purchaser have had notice of such meeting and
have been given a reasonable opportunity to attend such meeting. The language
to be used in relation to the Determination shall be English and any documents
which are not in the English language and which are to be provided to the
Independent Expert shall be provided to the Independent Expert in their
original form together with an English translation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) If: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) the Independent Expert determines that a Material Adverse
Effect has not occurred; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) Purchaser notifies Seller that it waives its right to
terminate this Agreement in respect of a Material Adverse Effect which exists
or which it considers to exist (including those found in a Determination to
exist), \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tthen, without prejudice to any other termination of this Agreement,
the Closing Date shall, if the Conditions Precedent have been satisfied or
waived on the date of the Determination referred to in Section 12.2(h)(i) or
the date of the notice from Purchaser referred to in Section 12.2(h)(ii), be
five (5) Business Days following such Determination or notice (as applicable),
provided that if such date would fall after the Longstop Date, the Longstop
Date shall be amended, to the day following such date.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) In the event that Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 12.2, such termination shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Purchaser and shall preclude the making of any Claim by Purchaser
under this Agreement in respect of the Material Adverse Effect for which this
Agreement was terminated, provided that the terms of Sections 12.3(b) shall
apply. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.3 Effects of Termination \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Upon termination in accordance with Section 12.1 all rights and
obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate save for (A) those set
out in the provisions of Section 1 (Definitions), Section 11 (Limitations of
Liability), this Section 12.3 (Effects of Termination) and Section 14
(Miscellaneous) which shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (B)
all accrued rights and liabilities of the Parties in respect of damages for
non-performance of any obligation falling due for performance or otherwise for
breach of contract prior to such termination which shall continue to exist.
 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) any professional consultants, upon obtaining a similar
undertaking of confidentiality (but excluding any right to make further
disclosure) from such consultants (provided, however, that in the case of

legal counsel is bound by an obligation of confidentiality); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) any Governmental Entity lawfully requesting such
information; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) the extent required pursuant to any legal or arbitration

entered into by the Parties in connection with this Agreement, and the full

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) No Party shall, and each Party shall procure that none of its
Affiliates shall, issue or make any public announcement or statement regarding
this Agreement or its terms or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior written consent of the other Parties (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) except (i) to third parties holding Pre-
emptive Rights that may be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby
or (ii) where such announcement or statement is required to comply with
applicable laws or the requirements of any recognised stock exchange on which
the shares or other securities of the relevant Party or any of Seller Group or

circumstances, any such announcement or statement shall be made, to the extent
permissible, after providing the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.6 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) This Agreement (including all Exhibits hereto) and any other
agreement entered into between the Parties in connection with this Agreement
contain the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and all understandings
(regardless of whether express or implied at law or  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tby custom, usage, course of dealing or otherwise) with respect
thereto, except as expressly set forth otherwise herein.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) It is agreed that: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) no Party has relied on or shall have any claim or remedy
arising under or in connection with any statement, representation, warranty or
undertaking made by or on behalf of the other Party (or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives) in relation to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that is not expressly set out in this Agreement or any other
agreement entered into between the Parties in connection with this
Agreement; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) any terms or conditions implied by law in any jurisdiction in
relation to the transactions contemplated by the this Agreement or any other
any other agreement entered into between the Parties in connection with this
Agreement are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law or, if incapable
of exclusion, any right or remedies in relation to them are irrevocably
waived; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) the only right or remedy of a Party in relation to any
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement entered into between the
Parties in connection with this Agreement shall be for breach of this
Agreement or such other agreement entered into between the Parties in
connection with this Agreement; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) except for any liability in respect of a breach of this
Agreement or any other agreement entered into between the Parties in
connection with this Agreement, no Party (nor any of its Affiliates or
Representatives) shall owe any duty of care or have any liability in tort or
otherwise to any other Party (or any of its Affiliates or Representatives) in
relation to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
agreement entered into between the Parties in connection with this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit any liability for (or
remedy in respect of) fraud. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Any provision of this Agreement (including this Section
14.6(d)) may be amended or waived only if such amendment or waiver is by
written instrument executed by all Parties and explicitly referring to this
Agreement. No waiver by any Party of any one or more defaults by another Party
in the performance of any provision of this Agreement shall operate and be
construed as a waiver of any future default or defaults by the same Party
whether such default is of a like or of a different character. Delay in
exercising or non-exercise of any right, power or remedy shall not be
considered a waiver of that right, power or remedy nor shall it otherwise
affect that right, power or remedy. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.7 Obligors; Assignments; Third Party Beneficiaries \t\t

 \t\t

Agreement.  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

of SIAC shall (in addition to appointing the third arbitrator) appoint an

notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment, enforcement of any arbitration amount or
otherwise) with respect to themselves or any of their property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.10 Severability and Invalidity \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t The provisions contained in this Agreement shall be enforceable
independently of each of the others and should any provision of this
Agreement, or any provision incorporated into this Agreement in the future, be
or become invalid or unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of the
other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. The invalid
or unenforceable provision shall be deemed to be substituted by a suitable and
equitable provision which, to the extent legally permissible, comes as close
as possible to the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable
provision. The same shall apply if any provision of this Agreement is invalid
or unenforceable because of the scope of any time period or performance
stipulated herein; in this case a legally permissible time period or
performance shall be deemed to have been agreed which comes as close as
possible to the stipulated time period or performance. Furthermore, in the
event a provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid in any respect under
the law of a jurisdiction, that shall not affect its legality, enforceability
or validity of such provision under the law of any other jurisdiction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.11 Counterpart Execution \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
and by the Parties to it on separate counterparts, and each such counterpart
shall be deemed an original Agreement for all purposes but all the
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument; provided
that no Party shall be bound to this Agreement unless and until all Parties
have executed a counterpart.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Transmission of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by
email (in PDF, JPEG or other agreed format) shall take effect as delivery of
an executed counterpart of this Agreement. If either method of delivery is
adopted, without prejudice to the validity of the agreement made, each Party
shall, upon request, provide the other with the original of such counterpart
as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.12 No Claims \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Purchaser shall not, and shall procure that its Affiliates
shall not, make any claim against any Seller\'s Representative, and Seller
shall not, and shall procure that its Affiliates shall not, make any claim
against any Purchaser\'s Representative, in each case in connection with any
misrepresentation or untrue statement made in connection with this Agreement
or the proposed sale by Seller and acquisition by Purchaser of the Sale Shares

contemplated by this Agreement, the Sale Shares, Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the Sale Companies) made available to Purchaser or to
any Purchaser\'s Representative in any form, in each case  \t\t

nothing in this Section 14.12(a) shall purport to exclude any liability for
fraud. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Seller irrevocably waives all rights and claims which it may
have against any Sale Company or any of its officers or employees in respect
of any misrepresentation, inaccuracy or omission in or from any information or
advice given by it or any Employee to Seller to enable it to give any of the
Seller\'s warranties in this Agreement and any agreement entered into or in
connection with this Agreement or to prepare the Data Room Information and
Disclosure Letters or to assume any of the obligations assumed or to be
assumed by it under or pursuant to this Agreement and any agreement entered
into or in connection with this Agreement, but provided that nothing in this
Section 14.12(b) shall purport to exclude any liability for fraud. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.13 Language \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t The language of this Agreement and the transactions envisaged by
it is English and all notices to be given in connection with this Agreement
must be in English. All demands, requests, statements, certificates or other
documents or communications to be provided in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions envisaged by it must be in English or accompanied by a
certified English translation; in this case the English translation prevails
unless the document or communication is a statutory or other official document
or communication. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.14 Rights \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t The rights of each Party under this Agreement are cumulative and
not exclusive of rights and remedies provided by law, other than those
expressly excluded under this Agreement. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, no failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right or remedy
relating to this Agreement or any other agreement entered into between the
Parties in connection with this Agreement shall affect or operate as a waiver
or variation of that right or remedy or preclude its exercise at any
subsequent time. No single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy
shall preclude any further exercise of it or the exercise of any other
remedy. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.15 No Merger \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe covenants, representations, warranties and indemnities contained

rules are hereby waived. \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2. Exclusions \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.1 Subject to paragraph 2.3, Seller shall not be liable under

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) it arises as a result of any transaction occurring in the

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) provision or reserve in respect of the liability is made or
reflected in the Locked Box Accounts and/or the Closing Statement; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) the liability is or arises in connection with any Transaction
Taxes solely in connection with the acquisition of the Sale Shares; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) such liability was discharged on or before Closing; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) such liability is a liability of the Sale Companies to make a
payment of Taxation in circumstances where the Sale Companies have already
collected, invoiced or deducted an amount on account of such Taxation and are
holding that amount in preparation for making a payment to the relevant
Taxation Authority on the due date;  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t79  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) it arises or is increased as a consequence of any change
(including any retrospective change), after the Closing, in the law (including
subordinate legislation), rule or regulation or judicial interpretation
thereof or in the generally published interpretation or practice of the
Taxation Authority or to the extent that such Taxation arises or is increased
by a change in the rate of Taxation after the Closing; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) it arises as a result of a change after Closing in the: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) date to which the Sale Companies makes up its accounts;
or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) bases upon which the accounts of the Sale Companies are
prepared, \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\texcept where such change is made and is necessary in order to comply
with generally accepted accounting principles where such principles were not
complied with as at Closing; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) such liability would not have arisen but for any transaction,
act or omission carried out by Purchaser or the Sale Companies (after
Closing), other than a transaction, act or omission which: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) was required by law;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) was effected under a legally binding obligation of the Sale
Companies entered into or created on or before Closing; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) was in the ordinary course of business of the Sale Companies
as carried on at Closing;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) the liability has been recovered by Purchaser under the Tax
Warranties or under another provision under this Agreement or any other
agreement entered into between the parties in connection with this Agreement;
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) the liability would not have arisen but for an act carried out
by Seller prior to Closing at the written request or with the written approval
of Purchaser (excluding the Purchaser's written approval to transfer an
Excluded Asset, an act or transaction taken in accordance with Section 9.1
(Interim Period Covenants) of this Agreement or paragraph 6 (Tax Computations)
of this Exhibit 6 (Taxation) or this Agreement, or paragraph 7 (Conduct of
Claims) of this Exhibit 6 (Taxation), or any other agreement entered into
between the parties in connection with this Agreement); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k) any Relief (other than a Purchaser's Relief) is available or is
made available for no consideration by a member of the Seller Group to relieve
or mitigate such Taxation; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(l) such liability arises by virtue of any claim, election,
surrender or disclaimer made or notice or consent given or by virtue of any
other thing done after Closing by or on behalf of a member of the Purchaser
Group (including the disclaimer of whole or part of any Relief) other than
where the making, giving or doing of such thing was taken into account in the
preparation of the Locked Box Accounts; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(m) such liability would not have arisen but for, or has been
increased by, a failure or omission by the Sale Companies to make any valid
claim, election, surrender or disclaimer or give any notice or consent or do
any other thing after Closing the making, giving or doing of which was taken
into account in computing any provision or reserve for Taxation or otherwise
in preparing the Locked Box Accounts or was otherwise requested by Seller
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t80  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

provided that Seller has notified Purchaser of any such action which needs to
be taken at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date on which it must
be done; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(n) any income, profits or gains to which the liability is
attributable were earned or received by or accrue to the Sale Companies on or
before the Locked Box Accounts Date but were not reflected in the Locked Box
Accounts or to the extent the liability arises because the assets of the Sale
Companies are greater than, or the liabilities are less than, those taken into
account in computing the provision or reserve for Taxation in the Locked Box
Accounts provided that this sub-paragraph 2.1(n) shall only apply in respect
of any income, profit or gains to the extent that the relevant Sale Company
retains the benefit of such income, profits or gains at Closing (either as
available cash or where such income profit or gains has been expected by the
relevant Sale Company in the ordinary course of business); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(o) such liability arises as a result of a failure of Purchaser to
comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement save to the extent
that such failure arises as a result of the failure by the Seller to comply
with its respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(p) it relates to interest and penalties to the extent that such
interest and penalties are attributable to the unreasonable delay or default
by Purchaser, any member of the Purchaser Group, or after Closing, the Sale
Companies; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(q) such liability arises in respect of, by reference to or in
consequence of any income, profits or gains earned, accrued or actually
received or any Event not in the ordinary course of the Sale Companies
business after the Locked Box Accounts Date and on or before Closing but where
the Sale Companies have the benefit of such income, profits or gains and such
benefit is retained by the Sale Companies at Closing; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(r) the liability would not have arisen or would have been reduced
but for a cessation of trade or material change in the nature or conduct of a
trade carried on by the Sale Companies in either case occurring after
Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.2 Paragraph 1 of this Exhibit 6 (Taxation) does not apply to a
liability unless specific written notice of such liability specifying in
reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to such liability has been
served on Seller on or prior to the date falling twenty one (21) Business Days
after the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the
underlying liability. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.3 Paragraphs 2.1(a), 2.1(h), 2.1(j) or 2.1(q) of this Exhibit 6
(Taxation) shall not apply to limit the liability of the Seller pursuant to
paragraph 1 in respect of any Liability for Taxation arising as a result of or
by reference to the circumstances or Events referred to in paragraph
1.1(d). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3. Recovery from Third Parties \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.1 Where Seller has made a payment under paragraph 1 or under the
Tax Warranties and Purchaser or Sale Companies become entitled to recover from
another person, any amount in respect of such liability, Purchaser shall or
procure that the Sale Companies shall: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) notify Seller of its entitlement as soon as reasonably
practicable; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) if so requested by Seller, and subject to Purchaser and the
Sale Companies being indemnified by Seller against all losses (including
additional Taxation), costs and expenses which may be properly and reasonably
incurred, take or procure that the Sale Companies take all reasonable and
prompt steps to enforce that recovery against the person in question  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t81  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

(keeping Seller informed of the progress of all action taken and providing
Seller with copies of all relevant correspondence and documentation). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.2 If Purchaser or the Sale Companies recovers an amount referred
to in paragraph 3.1, Purchaser shall account to Seller within fifteen (15)
Business Days of recovering any such amount for the lesser of: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) any amount recovered (including any related interest or
repayment supplement) less any Tax suffered in respect of that amount and any
reasonable costs and expenses of recovery (save to the extent that amount has
already been satisfied by the indemnity provided for in paragraph 3.1(b));
and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) the amount paid by Seller under paragraph 1 or under the Tax
Warranties in respect of the liability in question. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4. Overprovisions, Refunds and Savings \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.1 If the auditors for the time being of the Sale Companies
certify (at the sole cost and expense of Seller) that there has been an
Overprovision, Refund or Saving then such Overprovision, Refund or
Saving: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) shall first be set off against any payments then due from
Seller under paragraph 1 of this Exhibit 6 (Taxation) or in respect of the
Tax Warranties; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) (to the extent there is any excess) shall be set off against
any payment(s) already made or subsequently due under paragraph 1 of this
Exhibit 6 (Taxation) or for breach of Tax Warranty in chronological order
until exhausted, provided that to the extent that such Overprovision, Refund
or Saving is set off against any payment already made by Seller (and not
previously refunded under this sub-clause), it will promptly be repaid to
Seller. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.2 If Purchaser or the Sale Companies discovers that there has
been an Overprovision, Refund or Saving, Purchaser shall as soon as reasonably
practicable give written notice thereof to Seller such notice to include
reasonably sufficient details of such Overprovision, Refund or Saving and
Purchaser will use its reasonable endeavours to procure that the auditors for
the time being of the Sale Companies deal expeditiously with a request for a
determination as to whether an Overprovision, Refund or Saving has arisen or
will arise and will procure that the Sale Companies provide all assistance,
documents and other information as may be reasonably required by the
aforementioned auditors for that purpose.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.3 After the Sale Companies' auditors produce any certificate
under this paragraph 4, Seller or Purchaser, may, at any time, request the
auditors for the time being of the Sale Companies to review (at the expense of
the party making the aforementioned request) that certificate in the light of
all relevant circumstances, including any facts of which they were not or it
was not aware, and which were not taken into account, at the time when such
certificate was produced, and to certify whether, in their opinion, the
certificate remains correct or whether, in light of those circumstances, it
should be amended. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.4 If the auditors make an amendment to an earlier certificate and
the amount of the Overprovision, Refund or Saving is revised, that revised
amount shall be substituted for the previous amount and any adjusting payment
that is required shall be made by or to Seller (as the case may be) as soon as
reasonably practicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.5 If any dispute arises as to whether there is or has been any
Overprovision, Refund or Saving, such dispute shall be referred for
determination to a firm of chartered accountants agreed between Seller  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t82  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

and Purchaser (or failing such agreement to the Sale Companies' auditor), who
shall act as expert and not as arbitrator (the cost of the determination being
shared equally by Seller and Purchaser). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.6 Purchaser shall procure that all reasonable steps are taken
within a reasonable time to maximise an Overprovision, Refund or Saving. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5. Purchaser's Secondary Liabilities \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFrom and after the Locked Box Accounts Date, Purchaser shall be liable
for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and
against, (i) any Taxes (other than Transaction Taxes) incurred with respect to
the Sale Companies and the Sale Shares and attributable to periods beginning
after the Locked Box Accounts Date; (ii) any Taxes of Purchaser or any member
of the Purchaser Group; and (iii) any Transaction Taxes arising solely in
connection with the acquisition of the Sale Shares, excluding in respect of
any Taxes for which the Purchaser could make a claim against the Seller under
paragraph 1 or for breach of any Tax Warranty.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6. Tax Computations \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tPre-Closing Accounting Periods \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.1 Subject to and in accordance with the provisions of this
paragraph 6, Seller or its duly authorised agents shall (at the Sale
Companies' sole cost and expense): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) prepare and deal with (or procure the preparation and dealing
with) all computations and returns relating to Taxation; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) prepare and deal with all other matters which relate to the
computations and returns detailed in paragraph 6.1(a) above, including
correspondence,  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tin respect of all accounting periods (the "Pre-Closing Accounting
Periods") of the Sale Companies ending on or before Closing ("Pre-Closing Tax
Documents"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.2 Purchaser shall procure that the Sale Companies shall make such
claims, surrenders, disclaimers and elections or give such notice or consent
or do such other thing as were taken into account in computing a provision for
Tax in the Locked Box Accounts relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Documents.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.3 Seller or its duly authorised agents shall deliver all Pre-
Closing Tax Documents that are required to be authorised and signed by the
Sale Companies to Purchaser for authorising and signing prior to submission.
The Seller shall take into account and incorporate any reasonable comments of
the Purchaser on the Pre-Closing Tax Documents. If a time limit applies in
relation to the submission of any of the Pre-Closing Tax Documents, Seller
shall ensure that Purchaser receives the relevant Pre-Closing Tax Documents no
later than thirty (30) Business Days before the expiry of the time limit.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t6.4 Purchaser shall forward the Pre-Closing Tax Documents delivered
to it under paragraph 6.3 for review to the Seller at least fifteen (15)
Business Days prior to the intended submission date, which shall be no later
than the statutory filing date. Purchaser shall procure that the Pre- Closing
Tax Documents shall be authorised and submitted to the relevant Taxation
Authority without amendment or with such amendments as Seller agrees (acting
reasonably) and shall give Seller or its agents all such assistance as may be
required to agree the Pre-Closing Tax Documents with the relevant Taxation
Authority. \t\t

 \t\t\t6.5 Seller shall procure that: \t\t
