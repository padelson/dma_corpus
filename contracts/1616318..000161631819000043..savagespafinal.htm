Indebtedness, and the Final Transaction Expenses are determined, the Buyer
shall make payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Seller in the amount of any such excess.

the Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds such excess as
promptly as practicable following such period.

provisions set forth in this Section 2.3 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Buyer and the Seller with respect to (A) determining whether or
not any adjustment would be made to the Estimated Closing Payment pursuant to
this Section 2.3 (whether or not any such adjustment was, in fact, made),
and/or (B) determining the amount of any such adjustment.

Company or the Company Subsidiaries following the Closing shall be given
effect for purposes of determining the Final Closing Cash, the Final Closing
Indebtedness, or the Final Transaction Expenses.

amounts are so deducted or withheld and are paid over to the proper
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

of such customers or suppliers has cancelled, terminated or otherwise
materially altered (including any material reduction in the rate or amount of

liabilities), and (c) have adequate capital to carry on their respective
businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being
incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of any of the

any of its Affiliates.

5.28 Exclusivity of Representations. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in Articles 4 and 5 of this Agreement (as modified by the

Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective Affiliates, including with
respect to the Company Shares or their respective assets and liabilities, and
the Seller and the Company hereby disclaim all other representations and
warranties of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, written or oral, at law

or any of the Buyer's Affiliates, including omissions therefrom. Without
limiting the foregoing, neither the Seller nor the Company makes any
representation or warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, written
or oral, at law or in equity, to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any
Representatives of the Buyer of any of its Affiliates regarding the success,

any Law applicable to the Buyer; or (b) conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of

presentations, due diligence or in any other form in expectation of the
Contemplated Transactions. The Buyer acknowledges that the Buyer is acquiring
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries without any representation or
warranty as to merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of their

representation or warranty or other statement by or on behalf of the Company
or the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, including with respect to
any pro-forma financial information, financial projections or other forward-
looking statements of the Seller, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and

ARTICLE 7 

COVENANTS

7.1 Confidentiality.

(a) Neither Parent nor the Seller shall, and each shall cause their respective
Affiliates not to, use or disclose to any Person any Company Confidential
Information or any documents or information concerning the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates furnished to them by the Buyer or its Representatives in connection
with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions. In the event that
Parent, the Seller or any of their Affiliates are requested or required (by
oral question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil



investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such information,
Parent or the Seller, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to promptly notify the Buyer of the request or requirement so that the Buyer
may seek, at its sole cost and expense, an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.1(a). If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Parent,
the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates is, on the advice of counsel,
legally required to disclose any such information, Parent or the Seller, as
applicable, may disclose such information to the requesting authority;
provided, however, that Parent or the Seller, as applicable shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request of the
Buyer and at the Buyer's sole cost, an Order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the information
required to be disclosed as the Buyer shall designate in good faith.

(b) The Buyer shall not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to, use
or disclose to any Person any documents and information concerning the Seller,
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
the Business), furnished to it by Parent, the Seller or their respective
Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, in each case other than the Company Confidential Information. In
the event that the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, is requested or required
(by oral question or request for information or documents in any legal
proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
process) to disclose any such information, the Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly notify Parent and the Seller of the request or
requirement so that Parent or the Seller may seek, at their sole cost and
expense, an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the
provisions of this Section 7.1(b). If, in the absence of a protective order or
the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Buyer is, on the advice of counsel,
legally required to disclose any such information, the Buyer may disclose such
information to the requesting authority; provided, however, that the Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request
of Parent or the Seller and at Parent or the Seller's sole cost, an Order or
other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion
of the information required to be disclosed as Parent or the Seller shall
designate in good faith.

7.2 Public Announcements. No party to this Agreement will issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions without (a) providing a draft
of, and an opportunity to comment on, such public announcement or press
release to the other parties hereto (which draft shall be provided not less
than one (1) Business Day in advance of any such press release or public
announcement) and (b) obtaining the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto; provided that, subject to the immediately following sentence, nothing
herein will prohibit any party from (x) issuing or causing publication of any
such press release or public announcement to the extent that such disclosure
is required by applicable Law or stock exchange requirements, or (y)
disclosing any information that is reasonably required to be disclosed in
confidence to a party's and its Affiliates' respective directors, officers,
employees, professional advisers, current and potential investors and other
Representatives, in each case who are bound by customary obligations of
confidentiality with respect to such disclosures; provided, however, that such
party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms hereof by any such
Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any party to this
Agreement be permitted to disclose the nature, name or identity of any of the
Buyer's owners,



members, investors, partners or other financing sources; provided, however, in
the event that the Seller or any of its Affiliates, are requested or required
(by oral question or request for information or documents in any legal
proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
process) to disclose any such information, the Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly notify the Buyer of the request or requirement
so that the Buyer may seek, at its sole cost and expense, an appropriate
protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of Section 7.1(a).
If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder,
the Seller is, on the advice of counsel, legally required to disclose any such
information, the Seller may disclose such information to the requesting
authority; provided, however, that the Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request of the Buyer and at
the Buyer's sole cost, an Order or other assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded to such portion of the information required to be disclosed
as the Buyer shall designate in good faith.

(each, a "Retaining Party"), until the seventh anniversary of the Closing
Date, retain the books and records of the business of the Company and promptly
afford (a) in the case of the Seller, except to the extent provided under
Section 7.5(e)(ii), the Company, the Buyer, their respective Affiliates and
their respective Representatives; and (b) in the case of the Company, the
Seller and the Seller's Affiliates and Representatives (each such requesting
Person in subclause (a) or (b), a "Requesting Person") reasonable access to
the books and records, information, employees and auditors of Retaining Party
solely with respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing to
the extent necessary for the following bona fide purposes related to the
business of the Company: (i) to enable such Requesting Person to comply with
Tax, regulatory or financial reporting obligations, (ii) for use by such
Requesting Person in connection with any insurance claims or (iii) for use by
such Requesting Person in connection with any Action (subject to customary
confidentiality protections) related to the business of the Company; in each
case, reasonable evidence of which shall be provided to the Retaining Party
upon request (including access to the Retaining Party's employees to the
extent the Requesting Person (after consultation with the Retaining Party)
deems such access is necessary to respond to any Action, to participate in
depositions or to provide testimony in connection with any Action); provided
that no such access shall be granted to the extent involving or relating to a
dispute between the Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company
and/or the Buyer on the other hand; provided, further, that nothing in this
Section 7.3 shall obligate the Retaining Party to take or permit any action
that would result in any waiver of attorney-client privilege or violate any
Law or the terms of any Contracts to which the Retaining Party is a party. The
Requesting Person agrees to reimburse the Retaining Party promptly for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with any such request.

7.4 Employee Matters.

(a) Except as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement, from and after
the Closing Date until the twelve (12) month anniversary thereof (or such
later period as may be required by applicable Law), the Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to,
provide to each employee of the Company and each Company Subsidiary as of the
Closing who remains employed during such period (collectively, the "Continuing
Employees") (i) a base salary or hourly wage, as applicable, not less than
that provided to such



Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) target bonus
and incentive compensation opportunities (but excluding change-in-control,
retention and equity-related bonus and incentive opportunities) that are no
less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company
or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii)
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to
the Closing, provided, however, that no equity or equity-based plans or
arrangements, change-in-control or other transaction or retention payments or
benefits, defined benefit pension benefits, retiree medical benefits or other
similar plans or arrangements shall be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether such employee benefits are substantially comparable in the
aggregate.

(b) The Buyer shall cause service rendered by Continuing Employees prior to
the date set forth in the Transition Services Agreement through which the
Continuing Employees will continue participating in the applicable Parent
Plans (the "New Plans Commencement Date") to be taken into account for all
purposes including participation, coverage, vesting and level of benefits, as
applicable (but excluding benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension
plan, for purposes of level of benefits or benefit accruals under any post-
employment health or welfare benefit, or for any purpose under any equity-
based plan or arrangement), under all employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and arrangements of the Buyer and its Affiliates from and after the
New Plans Commencement Date (the "New Plans"), to the same extent as such
service was taken into account under corresponding plans of Parent, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, for such purposes;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall result in the duplication of any
benefits. Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Continuing Employees not to be subject to any pre-
existing condition or limitation under any New Plan that is a welfare plan
within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, for any condition for which such
Continuing Employee would have been entitled to coverage under the
corresponding plan of Parent, the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as
applicable, in which such employee participated immediately prior to the New
Plans Commencement Date. The Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
recognize co-payments made, and deductibles satisfied, by Continuing Employees
under the corresponding Parent Plans that are health plans in the calendar
year in which the New Plans Commencement Date occurs.

(c) Except as specifically provided herein, the Buyer or its Affiliates shall
not assume any obligations or Liabilities under or with respect to, or receive
any right or interest in any trusts relating to, any assets of or any
insurance, administration or other contracts pertaining to, any of the Parent
Plans.

(d) Except as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement, required by
applicable Law or as otherwise specifically provided herein, all Continuing
Employees will cease, effective as of the Closing Date or as of the New Plans
Commencement Date, as applicable, any participation in and any benefit accrual
under each of the Parent Plans. Parent and its Affiliates shall take all
necessary actions to effect such cessation of participation by Continuing
Employees under the Parent Plans in accordance with applicable Law and the
terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 7.4(d), Continuing Employees may continue after the Closing Date or
New Plans Commencement Date, as applicable, to participate



in accordance with, and subject to, their eligibility under the terms of (i)
Parent Plans which are pension plans with respect to vested, accrued benefits
as of the applicable Closing Date, or (ii) Parent Plans to the extent required
by applicable Law or terms of the Parent Plans.

(e) With respect to any Continuing Employee who was a participant in a health
or dependent care flexible spending account plan maintained by Parent or any
of its Affiliates immediately prior to the New Plans Commencement Date (in
either case, the "Parent FSA Plans"): (i) if the Company or any of its
Affiliates maintains a general purpose health flexible spending account plan
(a "GPHFSA Plan"), the Company and Parent shall, or shall cause one of their
respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect an FSA
Transfer (as defined below) of such Continuing Employee's account balance (if
any) under the Parent GPHFSA Plan to the GPHFSA Plan of the Company or one of
its Affiliates; (ii) if the Company or any of its Affiliates maintains a
limited purpose health flexible spending account plan (a "LPHFSA Plan"), the
Company and Parent shall, or shall cause one of their respective Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect an FSA Transfer (as defined
below) of such Continuing Employee's account balance (if any) under the Parent
LPHFSA Plan to the LPHFSA Plan of the Company or one of its Affiliates; and
(iii) if the Company or any of its Affiliates maintains a dependent care
flexible spending account (a "DCFSA Plan"), the Company and Parent shall, or
shall cause one of their respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to effect an FSA Transfer (as defined below) of such Continuing
Employee's account balance (if any) under the Parent DCFSA Plan to the
applicable DCFSA Plan of the Company or one of its Affiliates. For purposes of
this Section 7.4(e), "FSA Transfer" means (i) the election of a Continuing
Employee in effect under the applicable Parent FSA Plans by the Company or an
Affiliate of the Company immediately prior to the New Plans Commencement Date,
(ii) the assumption by the Company or an Affiliate of the Company of
responsibility for administering and paying under the applicable plans of the
Company or one of its Affiliates all eligible reimbursement claims of such
Continuing Employee incurred in the calendar year in which the New Plans
Commencement Date occurs that are submitted for payment on or after such New
Plans Commencement Date, whether such claims arise before, on or after such
New Plans Commencement Date, and (iii) as soon as practicable following the
New Plans Commencement Date, transfer by Parent (or an Affiliate of Parent) to
the Company in connection with the actions taken pursuant to clauses (i) and
(ii) of an amount in cash equal to (A) the sum of all contributions to the
applicable Parent FSA Plans made with respect to the calendar year in which
such Employment Commencement Date occurs by or on behalf of such Continuing
Employee prior to the New Plans Commencement Date, reduced by (B) the sum of
all claims incurred by such Continuing Employee under the applicable Parent
FSA Plans in the calendar year in which the New Plans Commencement Date occurs
that are submitted for payment prior to such New Plans Commencement Date;
provided, however, that if the amount described in subclause (B) exceeds the
amount described in clause (A), the Company shall reimburse Parent for such
difference.

(f) This Section 7.4 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 7.4,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 7.4. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend
or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 7.4
shall not create any right in any employee or



any other Person to any employment or continued employment with the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or to
any compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

7.5 Tax Matters.

(a) Transfer Taxes. Any and all sales, use, transfer, real property transfer
or gains tax, stamp tax, stock transfer tax, or other similar Tax imposed on
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, the Seller or the Buyer as a result of
the Contemplated Transactions and any penalties or interest (or addition to
Tax) with respect to such Taxes (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be
borne one-half (50%) by the Seller (and shall be Transaction Expenses) and
one-half (50%) by the Buyer when due.

(b) Inclusion in Consolidated Returns. Parent shall include, in accordance
with applicable Laws, the income of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(including any deferred intercompany items described in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-13 and any excess loss accounts taken into income under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-19) for all taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date in the consolidated Tax Returns for all periods
through the close of the Closing Date and shall pay any Taxes attributable to
such income. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the income of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any taxable period that includes the
Closing Date shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as
of the close of the Closing Date. If and to the extent necessary to avoid any
reduction in Tax attributes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d) the Seller shall make the election
described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6) to reduce the
Seller's basis in the Company Shares.

(c) Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
between the Seller and/or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be terminated effective as of
the Closing and, after the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

(d) Audits. If Parent, the Seller or any of their Affiliates receives written
notice of a proposed assessment or claim in an audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding relating to a consolidated Tax Return of the Parent Group,
and, before such audit or proceeding is resolved, it becomes reasonably likely
that Parent would not be able to timely pay in full the proposed assessment if
such proposed assessment were imposed in full on the Parent Group, then (i)
Parent shall promptly provide written notice to the Company and the Buyer and
(ii) Parent shall have the exclusive right to control all matters relating to
such audit or proceeding, provided that (A) the Buyer may retain separate
counsel at its sole cost and its expense to participate in proceedings
relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and (B) Parent shall not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to such audit or proceeding to the extent that such
judgment, compromise, or settlement without prior written consent of the
Company (not to be unreasonably withheld).

(e) Cooperation.



(i) Each of the Buyer and the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the
Seller, on the other hand, shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with any Tax matters
relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including by the
provision of reasonably relevant records or information).

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) shall have the right to receive or
obtain any information relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Seller or any
of its Affiliates (or any of its predecessors) other than information relating
solely to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

(iii) For any taxable period of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
ending on or before the Closing Date or any taxable period in which the
Closing occurs, with respect to any income Tax Return required to be filed by
the Parent Group, the Buyer, if so requested by the Seller, shall (for which
the Buyer shall be reimbursed by the Seller for reasonable out-of-pocket third
party costs) promptly (but in no event later than one hundred and twenty (120)
days following the Closing Date) cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to prepare and provide to the Seller with a package of Tax
information materials, which shall be completed in accordance with the
reasonable past practice of the Company and the relevant Company Subsidiaries
including reasonable past practice as to providing the information, schedules
and work papers and as to the method of computation of separate taxable income
or other relevant measure of income of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

7.6 Director and Officer Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Closing, to the extent permitted by Law, the Company
shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Company to, (i) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, all of the past and present directors, managers (in the case of
a limited liability company), officers and employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (collectively, together with their respective heirs,
executors or administrators, the "DandO Indemnified Parties") against any and
all losses incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that such DandO
Indemnified Party is or was a director, manager (in the case of a limited
liability company), officer or employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
or is or was serving at the request of the Company or a Company Subsidiary as
a director, manager (in the case of a limited liability company), officer or
employee of any other Person, whether asserted or claimed before, at or after
the Closing, and provide advancement of expenses to the DandO Indemnified
Parties (provided that the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom expenses are
advanced provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such DandO Indemnified Parties are not entitled to
indemnification), in all such cases on terms no less favorable than those by
such Persons who are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses
before the date hereof by the Company or a Company Subsidiary pursuant to its
Organizational Documents in existence immediately before the Closing,



(ii) subject to the limitations set forth in clause (i) for a period of six
(6) years after the Closing, include and cause to be maintained in effect
provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, managers (in the
case of a limited liability company), officers and employees, and
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors, managers (in the
case of a limited liability company), officers and employees, in each case on
terms no less favorable to the DandO Indemnified Parties than those contained in
the Organizational Documents of the Company in effect immediately prior to the
Closing, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
during such six (6) year period in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Party, and (iii) not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Action or threatened
Action (and in which indemnification could be sought by a DandO Indemnified
Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such DandO Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such Action or such DandO Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing
to the entry of such judgment.

(b) The obligations of the Buyer, the Company and each Company Subsidiary
under this Section 7.6 shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any
manner so as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party to whom this
Section 7.6 applies without the written consent of such affected DandO
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties
to whom this Section 7.6 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
Section 7.6, and this Section 7.6 shall be enforceable by such DandO Indemnified
Parties and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Buyer, the
Company and each Company Subsidiary).

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to insurance claims under any policy that
is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any DandO Indemnified Party, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.6 is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

7.7 Change of Name; Phase Out. Except as set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement, as promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to, remove or procure the removal of all references to
and reproductions of the names "Vista", and "Vista Outdoor" from all
properties and assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including
packaging or printed advertising and promotional materials, invoices,
letterhead, company forms, business cards, product instructions or like
materials, buildings, signs and vehicles, production molds and other
equipment, and electronic databases and websites; provided, however, that (a)
during such ninety (90)-day period, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
may continue to use and distribute such materials to the extent they exist on
the Closing Date; (b) such ninety (90)-day period shall be further extended as
reasonably necessary to sell off any pre-existing product stock, inventory,
and materials containing the names "Vista" and "Vista Outdoors," and (c) the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall have the right to maintain and use
all books, records, archived copies, electronic backups, and other materials
containing the names "Vista" and "Vista Outdoors" for purposes of complying
with Law, including Law governing the retention of business records, in
perpetuity.



7.8 RandW Insurance Policy. The premium payable to the underwriters in respect
of the RandW Insurance Policy, and all other brokerage commissions, Taxes,
expenses, fees, costs or deductibles associated therewith, shall be borne
solely by the Seller. The Buyer agrees to not amend the RandW Insurance Policy
following the Closing in a manner that would materially and adversely affect
the rights of the Seller set forth in this Section 7.8 without the prior
written consent of the Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). At such time as the Buyer obtains the final RandW
Insurance Policy, a copy of such policy shall be provided to the Seller as
soon as reasonably practicable. The Buyer shall cause the RandW Insurance Policy
to expressly provide that the insurer(s) under the RandW Insurance Policy shall
not have the right to, and will not, pursue any subrogation rights against the
Seller or any of its respective Affiliates, or any of its Affiliates',
respective owners of Equity Interests, officers, directors, employees, agents,
Representatives, successors and permitted assigns in connection with any claim
made by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates thereunder, except in the case of
Fraud.

7.9 Pre-Closing Insurance.

(a) With respect to the Current Insurance Policies, Parent and the Seller, on
behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates, agree to maintain such
Current Insurance Policies that covered the Business, Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, managers (in the case of a
limited liability company), officers and employees prior to the Closing and
hereby agree that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries may continue to
make claims under such policies to the extent that coverage under such
insurance policies applies and provided that the events underlying any such
claim occurred prior to the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, until
the six (6)-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall maintain, or
cause the Seller or its or their other Affiliates, as applicable, to maintain,
the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, the employment
practices liability insurance policy and the fiduciary liability insurance
policy, in each case, maintained by Parent, the Seller or its or their
respective Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing for the benefit of the
directors, officers and employees of the Company in respect of claims arising
out of or relating to events which occurred prior to the Closing. Any such
claims made by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries shall be at the sole
cost and expense (including with respect to any applicable deductibles and/or
self-insured retentions in connection with such claim) of the Company.

(b) With respect to any historical insurance policies that have previously
covered the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (or any predecessor),
the Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby agrees that Parent
and its Affiliates may make claims under such policies to the extent that
coverage under such insurance policies applies and provided that the events
underlying any such claim occurred prior to the Closing. Any such claims made
by Parent or its Affiliate shall be at the sole cost and expense (including
with respect to any applicable deductibles and/or self-insured retentions in
connection with such claim) of Parent or the Seller, as applicable.

(c) Each of the parties hereunder acknowledges and agrees that it shall, shall
cause its Affiliates and their respective Representatives to, reasonably
cooperate and provide



reasonable assistance to the other party(ies) hereunder in connection with any
claims contemplated by this Section 7.9.

7.10 Further Assurances; Post-Closing Transfers.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, upon the request of either the Seller,
the Buyer or the Company, each of the parties hereto shall do, execute,
acknowledge and deliver all such further acts, assurances, deeds, assignments,
transfers, conveyances and other instruments and papers as may be reasonably
required or appropriate to carry out the Contemplated Transactions. The Seller
and its Affiliates shall refer all customer inquiries relating to the
Company's business to the Company from and after the Closing. In addition,
each of Parent, the Seller, the Buyer and the Company shall use their
reasonable best efforts to prepare and submit all required notifications to
the U.S. Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ("DDTC")
of the Contemplated Transactions and to provide all information required for
the Company or one its Affiliates to file a registration statement with DDTC.
Each of Parent, the Seller, the Buyer and the Company shall use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly inform the other parties of any oral
communications with, and provide copies of written communications with, DDTC;
provided that no party shall be required to share communications containing
confidential business information of such party if such confidential
information is unrelated to the Contemplated Transactions. In addition, each
of Parent, the Seller, the Buyer and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to act promptly and cooperatively in providing all information
required to amend the Permits to give effect to the Contemplated Transactions
and to obtain all required approvals pertaining to import and export of the
products or services of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the
Business; provided, however, the Buyer agrees to reimburse Parent and the
Seller and their respective Affiliates promptly for all reasonable and
documented out of pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with any
such requests; provided, further, Parent and/or the Seller shall provide
notice to the Buyer prior to incurring such out of pocket costs and expenses.

(b) To the extent that any Contract or any other asset relating primarily to
the Business (each, a "Non-Assigned Asset") has not been assigned, transferred
or conveyed from the Seller or its Affiliates to the Company or a Company
Subsidiary prior to the Closing, (i) the Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to subject to receipt of
any required third-party consent (which the Seller or its applicable Affiliate
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain), effect the assignment,
transfer or conveyance of such Non-Assigned Asset to the Company or a Company
Subsidiary, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances), as soon as practicable following the Closing Date and for no
additional consideration and (ii) until any such assignment, transfer or
conveyance has been completed, to the extent permitted by any applicable Law,
the Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, take such other actions as may be necessary to place the parties in the
position that the parties would have been in had the Non-Assigned Assets been
assigned, transferred or conveyed to the Company or a Company Subsidiary at or
prior to the Closing such that all of the benefits and burdens relating to
such Non-Assigned Assets, including expenses, risk of loss, potential for gain
and control of such Non-Assigned Assets inure from and after the Closing to
the Company or a Company Subsidiary. In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) to
the extent permitted by any applicable Law, the Seller shall, and if
applicable shall cause its Affiliates to, hold all such Non-Assigned



Assets on behalf of and for the benefit of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as and when due in the Ordinary Course of Business in accordance
with their terms and (ii) the Buyer shall cause the Company or the applicable
Company Subsidiary to accept, effect and otherwise reasonably cooperate with
the Seller (or the applicable Affiliates of the Seller) with respect to the
assignments, transfers and conveyances contemplated by this Section 7.10(b)
(collectively the "Post-Closing Transfers").

(c) The Seller shall consult with the Buyer in connection with the Post-
Closing Transfers, including (i) at the request of the Buyer, providing
updates and information regarding the status thereof, including copies of
documents related to the Post-Closing Transfers and (ii) providing the Buyer
with a reasonable opportunity in advance of effecting any Post-Closing
Transfer to review and comment on all documentation relating thereto and
reasonably cooperating with the Buyer and its counsel in respect of the form
thereof such documentation it is in a form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the Buyer and its counsel.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if, prior to the
Closing, the Seller or any of its Affiliates failed to assign or register all,
rights, title and interests in and to any Intellectual Property owned or
purported to be owned by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, created by
or principally on behalf of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or used,
developed or created in the conduct of the Business (including any data
collected by or principally on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, including through any website associated with the Business, any
Intellectual Property developed or created by any employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, and any Intellectual Property developed or created by
any brand ambassador or similar such third party acting on behalf of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary), then, from and after the Closing Date,
upon the reasonable request of the Company and without any further payment or
consideration from the Company, the Seller shall do, execute, acknowledge and
deliver all such further acts, assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers,
conveyances and other instruments and papers as the Company may determine in
its reasonable discretion are required or appropriate to carry out the
Contemplated Transactions and the transfer and assignment of such Intellectual
Property assets and rights, including execution, acknowledgment and
recordation of other such papers and using commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the same from the respective inventors, as necessary or desirable for
fully perfecting and conveying to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries the
benefit of Contemplated Transactions and all such Intellectual Property.
Effective as of the Closing Date, the Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, hereby grants to the Company an exclusive (even as to the Seller
and its Affiliates, other than with respect to any shared data, if applicable,
for which the license granted hereunder will be non-exclusive), perpetual,
irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, freely sublicensable license under all
of the Seller's and its Affiliates' rights, title and interest in and to such
Intellectual Property, to use and exploit such Intellectual Property in any
manner whatsoever.

7.11 Letters of Credit; Bonds.

(a) The Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, replace as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later than thirty (30)
days after the Closing Date, the outstanding letters of credits for the
benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary set forth



on Schedule 7.11(a) (the "Letters of Credit"). Until such time as the Buyer
replaces the Letters of Credit, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
Parent, the Seller and their respective Affiliates from any and all Losses
incurred in connection with the Letters of Credit.

(b) After the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
maintain the outstanding surety bonds for the benefit of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary set forth on Schedule 7.11(b) (the "Bonds") through the
term of the applicable Contract of such Bonds. The Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless Parent, the Seller and their respective Affiliates from any and
all Losses incurred in connection with the Bonds following the Closing.

ARTICLE 8 

SURVIVAL; SPECIFIC INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 Survival.

(a) Each of the provisions of Article 1, Article 7, this Article 8, Article 9
and Section 2.3 of this Agreement and any other covenants and other agreements
that by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing
shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions. Subject to the foregoing sentence and Section 8.1(b) and except
as expressly provided in Section 8.2, all other representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement will not survive beyond
the Closing, such that no claim for breach of any such representation or
warranty, covenant, or agreement, detrimental reliance or any other right or
remedy (whether in contract, in tort, or at law or in equity) may be brought
after the Closing with respect thereto against the Buyer, the Company, any
Company Subsidiary, Parent, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates,
or any of their, or their Affiliates', respective owners of Equity Interests,
officers, directors, employees, agents, Representatives, successors and
permitted assigns, and there will be no liability in respect thereof, whether
such purported liability has accrued prior to, on or after the Closing, on the
part of any such Person; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Section 8.1 is intended to limit (i) the survival periods contained in
the RandW Insurance Policy, which shall contain survival periods that shall
control for purposes thereunder or (ii) the survival period with respect to
the representation regarding Closing Working Capital made in the Pre-Closing
Statement delivered by Parent pursuant to Section 2.3(a).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement shall, or shall be deemed to, limit or waive any right of the
parties hereto to bring any claim or action based on Fraud against any Person
under applicable Law, or constitute an admission by any party that any element
of a claim for Fraud cannot be established against any Person under applicable
Law.

8.2 Specific Indemnity. From and after the Closing, Parent, the Seller, each
of their respective Affiliates and each of their and their Affiliates'
respective successors and assigns (each, an "Indemnifying Person" and,
collectively, the "Indemnifying Persons") shall (jointly and severally)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, each of their respective Affiliates and their and their
Affiliates' respective owners of Equity Interests, officers, directors,
employees, agents, Representatives, successors and assigns (each, a "Buyer



Indemnified Person") from, against and in respect of any and all claims,
judgments, liabilities, losses, damages, assessments, fines, penalties, Taxes,
fees and costs (including reasonable attorneys' and experts' fees and
expenses) (collectively, "Losses") incurred or suffered by all or any of the
Buyer Indemnified Persons as a result of, arising out of or relating to,
directly or indirectly, the matters set forth on Schedule 8.2 (in each case
subject to the limitations set forth therein).

8.3 Third-Party Claims; Notice of Claims; Defense.

(a) Notice of Third-Party Claims. The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall give
prompt notice in writing, which shall be no later than fifteen (15) days after
the receipt of such claim (a "Claim Notice"), to Parent or the Seller of the
assertion of any claim or the commencement of any Action or other claims or
actions by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under Section 8.2 (collectively, the "Covered
Claims"); provided that the failure of the Buyer Indemnified Persons to so
notify Parent or the Seller shall not limit the indemnity obligations
hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have materially prejudiced
any Indemnifying Person.

(b) Assumption of Defense, etc. Promptly, but in any event no later than
thirty (30) days, after receipt by an Indemnifying Person of a Claim Notice,
such Indemnifying Person may, at its option, assume and control the defense
and prosecution of the Covered Claim with counsel of its choice, which, if
such counsel is not Reed Smith and/or Pisciotti and Malsh P.C., shall be
satisfactory to the Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), by delivering written notice to the Buyer within such
thirty (30) day period acknowledging that the Buyer Indemnified Persons are
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 with respect to such
Covered Claim; provided that no Indemnifying Person shall be permitted to
assume and control the defense of any Covered Claim (but may participate, at
its own expense, in the defense of such Covered Claim) if (i) such Covered
Claim involves a criminal claim, (ii) such Covered Claim seeks an injunction
or other equitable relief against any Buyer Indemnified Person or its
business, or (iii) a Buyer Indemnified Person has been advised by counsel that
such Covered Claim involves a conflict or potential conflict between such
Buyer Indemnified Person and an Indemnifying Person in connection with the
defense of such Covered Claim (other than solely the existence of the
Indemnifying Persons' obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons
hereunder) (the limitations in the foregoing subclauses (i)-(iii), the
"Assumption Limitations"). If no Assumption Limitations are implicated, and
the Indemnifying Person elects to assume and control the defense and
prosecution of a Covered Claim, the Buyer Indemnified Persons, at the expense
of the Indemnifying Persons (which shall not include any costs or expenses for
any internal time of any employee, officer, director of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries), shall reasonably cooperate in the compromise of, or
defense against, such Covered Claim. Any Buyer Indemnified Person shall have
the right to employ separate counsel in any such action or claim and to
participate in (but not control) the defense and prosecution thereof either
(i) at its own expense or (ii) at the Indemnifying Persons' cost and expense
if (A) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in
writing by any Indemnifying Person or (B) in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to any Buyer Indemnified Person, a conflict or potential conflict exists
between any Buyer Indemnified Person and any Indemnifying Persons that would
make such separate representation required by applicable professional
responsibility rules (provided that, in the case of subclauses (ii), the



Indemnifying Persons shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more
than one firm of counsel for all of the Buyer Indemnified Persons, other than
local counsel, in any action or claim or group of related actions or claims).

(c) Limitations on Indemnifying Persons' Control. No Indemnifying Person shall
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to any Covered Claim without the prior written consent
of the Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless such judgment, compromise or settlement (i) provides for the
payment by the Indemnifying Person of money as sole relief for the claimant,
(ii) provides for a full release of all Buyer Indemnified Persons from all
liabilities arising or relating to the Covered Claim and (iii) involves no
finding or admission of wrongdoing on behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Person.

(d) Buyer Indemnified Persons' Control. If (i) any Assumption Limitation is
implicated, (ii) the Indemnifying Person does not deliver the notice required
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or (iii) the Indemnifying Persons otherwise at any
time fail to conduct the defense of the Covered Claim diligently, the Buyer
Indemnified Persons may defend the Covered Claim. In the event that the Buyer
Indemnified Persons conduct the defense of the Covered Claim pursuant to this
Section 8.3(d), no Indemnifying Person shall be liable to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Person with respect to such Covered Claim if the Buyer Indemnified
Person consents to the entry of a judgment or enters into any compromise or
settlement with respect to such Covered Claim without the prior written
consent of any Indemnifying Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that the Buyer Indemnified
Persons conduct the defense of the Covered Claim pursuant to this Section
8.3(d), subject to the preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Persons shall
remain responsible for any and all Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Persons
may incur or suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature
of or caused by the Covered Claim to the fullest extent provided in this
Article 8.

8.4 Recovery.

(a) The amount of any Losses sustained by a Buyer Indemnified Person shall be
reduced by the amount actually recovered by such Buyer Indemnified Person in
respect of such Losses under any insurance policy (net of any premium
increases resulting from the applicable claim(s) and out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) actually incurred
to collect such amounts), any indemnification or similar agreements, or other
rights of recovery (and the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek such recoveries). To the extent that any such
recovery is obtained after the Buyer Indemnified Person has received payment
from the Indemnifying Person with respect to the applicable Losses, the Buyer
Indemnified Person obtaining such recovery shall promptly refund such amount
(net of any premium increases resulting from the applicable claim(s) and out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred
to collect such amounts) to the Indemnifying Person to the extent it results
in duplicate recovery for the same Losses.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, all
indemnification payments required to be made to a Buyer Indemnified Person
pursuant to this Agreement shall be determined net of any Tax benefits
(determined on a "with" and "without" basis)



actually received in cash (whether by actual receipt of a cash tax refund or
an actual reduction of cash Taxes due and owing) by a Buyer Indemnified Person
seeking indemnification hereunder arising from the deductibility against Taxes
of Losses that gave rise to such indemnity payment in the year of the Loss or
immediate following year. The parties shall cooperate and provide all
information reasonably available to a party and reasonably requested by the
other party in connection with the calculation of such Tax benefits, and shall
act in good faith to resolve any disputed item as promptly as practicable.

8.5 No Circular Recovery. Parent and the Seller hereby agree that neither
they, nor any other Indemnifying Person, shall make any claim for
indemnification against the Company or any Company Subsidiary by reason of the
fact that it was a controlling person, director, employee or Representative of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or was serving as such for another
Person at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (whether such
claim is for Losses of any kind or otherwise and whether such claim is
pursuant to any Law, Organizational Document, Contract or otherwise) with
respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Person against an
Indemnifying Person under this Agreement or otherwise relating to this
Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any of the Contemplated
Transactions.

8.6 Tax Treatment of Specific Indemnity Payments. Any indemnity payment made
pursuant to this Article 8 shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase
price for Tax purposes unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

8.7 Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, as a material inducement to the other parties hereto entering into
this Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, except
(a) as set forth in Section 9.16, (b) for the purchase price adjustment
procedures set forth in Section 2.3, (c) for amounts recoverable under the RandW
Insurance Policy or (d) in the case of Fraud, the rights of the parties to
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article 8 shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy for the parties hereto against the Indemnifying Persons,
their respective Affiliates and any of their respective Representatives with
respect to any matter in any way arising from or relating to this Agreement,
regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be
sought to be imposed, whether including under the common law or federal or
state law, sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity,
including with respect to any claims made under any Environmental Laws
(including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (42 U.S.C. sec. 9601, et seq.)), and the parties hereby agree
that, except as specifically set forth by this Section 8.7, the Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall have no remedy or recourse against the Indemnifying
Persons, their respective Affiliates and any of their respective
Representatives with respect to any of the foregoing other than pursuant to,
and subject to the terms and conditions of, this Article 8. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Buyer agrees that neither it nor any other Buyer
Indemnified Person shall be permitted make any claim under any law, rule,
regulation, judgment, order or decree of any Governmental Authority, including
Environmental Laws, arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby other
than as provided under this Agreement. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
the Buyer Indemnified Persons may not avoid such limitation on liability by
(x) seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other
theory of liability, except as specifically set forth by this Section 8.7, all
of which are hereby waived, or (y) asserting or threatening any



claim against any Person that is not a party hereto (or a successor to a party
hereto) for breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement.

and claims pursuant to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, or
(ii) claims to enforce this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

9.9 Waiver. A waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement by any party
shall only be effective if in writing and shall not be construed as a waiver
of any subsequent breach or failure of the same term or condition, or a waiver
of any other term or condition of this Agreement. Except as expressly provided
in this Agreement, no delay or omission on the part of any party in exercising
any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a waiver

9.10 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted
successors and assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by
operation of law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights, obligations

original of this Agreement.

9.13 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement and any claim or
controversy hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of
conflict of laws thereof.



9.14 Arbitration.

(a) Subject to Section 9.14(e), any controversy, dispute or claim arising out
of or relating to this Agreement (other than (i) in the case where a party
seeks to obtain specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
relief or in connection with Section 9.16 and (ii) with respect to the
purchase price adjustment dispute procedures set forth in Section 2.3) or any
breach or alleged breach hereof and including any dispute over arbitrability
or jurisdiction shall be exclusively resolved by arbitration in the City of
New York, New York, in accordance with the then current CPR Institute for
Dispute Resolution ("CPR") Rules for Administered Arbitration (the "Rules"),
by three neutral, independent and impartial arbitrators, one of whom shall be
appointed by the Buyer and one of whom shall be appointed by the Seller,
within twenty (20) days of the commencement of the arbitration. The third
arbitrator shall be appointed by the first two arbitrators within twenty (20)
days of the appointment of the second arbitrator. Any arbitrator not timely
appointed shall be appointed by the CPR in accordance with the Rules. If the
dispute concerns any matter involving accounting issues, at least one of the
arbitrators shall be a mutually agreed upon independent certified public
accountant affiliated with a national accounting firm; otherwise, each
arbitrator shall be a neutral and impartial lawyer with excellent academic and
professional credentials who is or has been practicing law for at least
fifteen (15) years, specializing in sophisticated business transactions.

(b) The arbitrators shall conduct such evidentiary or other hearings as the
arbitrators deem necessary or appropriate. Each party shall be entitled to
seek the discovery of documents relating to the issues in dispute and each
party shall be entitled to five (5) depositions and a deposition of any expert
whose testimony is to be submitted pursuant to the following sentence. If
expert testimony is to be submitted by a party, each other party shall be
entitled to a description of the matter as to which such expert testimony is
to be submitted and the basis therefor. The arbitrators may issue subpoenas
requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all
books, papers and documents relating to the issues in dispute, whether such
attendance and production is at the hearing on the merits or at a deposition
prior to such hearing. The arbitrators may also, in their discretion, permit
introduction into evidence of the transcripts from such depositions if the
witness is unavailable for the hearing. All arbitration proceedings including
the existence of an arbitration request or proceeding, any settlements
relating thereto, all documents exchanged or produced and memorials, briefs or
other information shall be confidential and may not be used or disclosed by
the parties or their representatives except as may be reasonably necessary to
enforce any arbitral award or as required by applicable Law.

(c) The arbitrators shall base their decision and award on applicable law and
judicial precedent, and shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief
that a Court of the State of Delaware could order or grant, including specific
performance and injunctive relief. The arbitrators' decision and award shall
be in writing and shall be accompanied by a written statement containing a
summary of the issues in controversy, a description of the award and an
explanation of the reasons for the decision and award, including findings of
fact, conclusions of law and the reasoned application of applicable law to the
facts and questions of law presented by the issues in controversy. The
arbitrators shall endeavor to deliver their decision within three (3) months
of the appointment of the last arbitrator. In rendering such decision and
award, the arbitrators shall not



add to, subtract from or otherwise modify the provisions of this Agreement.
The arbitrators shall not have the power to award punitive, exemplary or
analogous damages.

(d) Each party shall bear all of its costs and fees incurred in connection
with such arbitration proceedings, including administrative fees, attorneys'
fees, fees of expert witnesses and travel expenses (collectively, "Costs and
Fees"), and each party shall bear equally the fees and expenses of the
arbitrators and all other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
arbitration (collectively, "Arbitration Expenses"). Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, the arbitrators shall be empowered to require anyone (1)
or more of the parties to bear all or any portion of the Costs and Fees and/or
Arbitration Expenses in the event that the arbitrators determine that such
party has acted in bad faith.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in herein, the
arbitration shall be governed by the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §
1 et seq. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the
parties, and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein
and without prejudice to the above procedures, any party may apply to any
court of competent jurisdiction for temporary injunctive or other provisional
equitable judicial relief if in such party's sole judgment such action is
necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo until such
time as the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise
resolved. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be available
under the jurisdiction of a court, the arbitrators shall have full authority
to grant provisional remedies.

9.15 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

9.16 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach or threaten to breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (a) there is
adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate



remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an order or
injunction to prevent breaches or threatened breaches and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

9.17 Severability. If any term, provision, agreement, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, agreements,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Contemplated Transactions is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the Contemplated
Transactions may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

9.18 Legal Representation.

(a) The Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), acknowledges and agrees
that Reed Smith LLP ("Reed Smith") has acted as counsel for the Seller, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions (the "Acquisition Engagement"), and in connection
with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, Reed Smith has not
acted as counsel for any other Person, including the Buyer.

(b) Only the Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall be
considered clients of Reed Smith in the Acquisition Engagement. The Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries), acknowledges and agrees that all confidential
communications between the Seller, the Company and their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Reed Smith, on the other hand, that relate
exclusively to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
Acquisition Engagement or any dispute arising under thereunder ("Privileged
Communications") shall be deemed attorney-client privileged, and shall be
deemed to belong solely to the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries), and not the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, and shall not pass to or be claimed, held, or used by the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates upon or after the Closing. Accordingly, the Buyer and
its Affiliates shall not have access to any such Privileged Communications, or
to the files of Reed Smith relating to the Acquisition Engagement, whether or
not the Closing occurs. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon
and after the Closing, (i) to the extent that Privileged Communications in
respect of the Acquisition Engagement constitute property of the client,
except as otherwise provided herein, only the Seller and its Affiliates shall
hold such property rights and (ii) Reed Smith shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such Privileged Communications to the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Reed
Smith and the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Reed Smith shall not disclose any
Privileged Communications to any third parties (other than Representatives,
accountants and advisors of the Seller and its Affiliates; provided that such
Representatives, accountants and advisors are instructed



to maintain the confidence of such Privileged Communications). The Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries), irrevocably waives any right it may have to
discover or obtain any such Privileged Communications. If and to the extent
that, at any time subsequent to Closing, the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) shall
have the right to assert or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect
to any such Privileged Communications between the Company or its Affiliates
and any Person representing them that occurred at any time prior to the
Closing, the Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after
the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), shall be entitled to
waive such privilege only with the prior written consent of the Seller (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

(c) The Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), acknowledges and agrees
that Reed Smith is acting as counsel for the Seller, the Company and their
respective Affiliates and that the Seller reasonably anticipates that Reed
Smith will continue to represent it and/or its Affiliates in future matters.
Accordingly, the Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including
after the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), expressly (i)
consents to Reed Smith's representation of the Seller and/or their respective
Affiliates in any matter, including any post-Closing matter in which the
interests of the Buyer and the Company, on the one hand, and the Seller or its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse, including any matter relating to
the Contemplated Transactions or any dispute or disagreement relating thereto,
and whether or not such matter is one in which Reed Smith may have previously
advised the Seller, the Company or their respective Affiliates and (ii)
consents to the disclosure by Reed Smith to the Seller or its Affiliates of
any information learned by Reed Smith in the course of its representation of
the Seller, the Company or their respective Affiliates, whether or not such
information is subject to attorney-client privilege, attorney work product
protection, or Reed Smith's duty of confidentiality.

(d) Upon and after the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
cease to have any attorney-client relationship with Reed Smith, unless and to
the extent Reed Smith is expressly engaged in writing by the Company and/or
the Company Subsidiaries to represent the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
after the Closing and either (i) such engagement involves no conflict of
interest with respect to the Seller and/or any of its Affiliates or (ii) the
Seller and/or any of its Affiliates, as applicable, consent in writing to such
engagement. Any such representation of the Company by Reed Smith after the
Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof.
