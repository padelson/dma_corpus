liabilities and  duties of Hampton and Apple will become debts, liabilities
and  duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  



  

  2.3 __Certificate of Incorporation and  Bylaws_._ The amended and restated
certificate  of incorporation (" _Certificate of  Incorporation_ ") and the
amended and restated bylaws  (" _Bylaws_ ") of Hampton as in effect
immediately  prior to the Effective Time will be amended to read in

further in compliance with the DGCL. 

  



  

  2.4 __Directors_._ At the  Effective Time, the board of directors of the

  3.1 __Conversion of Capital  Stock_._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of  the Merger and without any action on the part of Hampton, Apple  or the
holders of the following securities: 

  



  

  (a) The Apple Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than any shares  of Apple Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to  Section 3.1(b)) will be converted into and become the
right  to receive a number of shares of Hampton Class A Common  Stock equal
to one-third of the number of shares of Hampton  Common Stock to be issued in
the Spin-Off (" _Merger  Consideration_ "). Each share of Apple Common Stock
will  be converted into and become the right to receive a number of  shares
of Hampton Class A Common Stock equal to the Merger  Consideration divided by
the number of shares of Apple Common  Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective  Time (other than any shares of Apple
Common Stock to be  cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b)). For the avoidance
of  doubt, the Apple Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately  prior
to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Apple  Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b))  will be converted into and become the
right to receive a number  of shares of Hampton Class A Common Stock which,
when  divided by the total number of shares of 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Hampton Common Stock to be issued in the Spin-Off and the  Merger, equals
25.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of the  common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. Following the  Effective Time, all shares of Apple
Common Stock will no longer  be outstanding and will automatically be
cancelled and retired  and cease to exist. 

  



  

  (b) Each share of Apple Common Stock owned by Apple, Parent  or any direct
or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Apple or  Parent (other than, in any
such case, trust accounts, managed  accounts, custodial accounts and the like
that are beneficially  owned by third parties) immediately prior to the
Effective Time  will be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no
payment  will be made with respect thereto. 

  



  

  (c) Each share of Hampton Class A Common Stock and  Hampton Class B Common
Stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time will
remain issued and  outstanding as a share of Hampton Class A Common Stock
and  Hampton Class B Common Stock, respectively, following the  Effective
Time. 

  



  

  (d) Prior to the Effective Time, Apple and the Apple Board  of Directors
will take (or will cause to be taken) all actions  necessary (including
providing such notices, adopting such  amendments to Apple Option Plans and
taking such other actions  as are reasonably requested by Hampton) such
that: 

  



  

  (i) All Apple Options that are not otherwise exercisable  will become
exercisable and if, elected by the holder, will be  exercised effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective  Time, with the effect that the Apple
Common Stock into which  they are converted will be deemed for all purposes
to be issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  



  

  (ii) Without limiting the generality or effect of  Section 3.1(d)(i), the
holders of all Apple Options will be  notified that Apple Options may be
exercised at any time during  the period that commences on the date of this
Agreement and ends  on the day before the Effective Time (the " _Exercise 
Period_ "), provided that (A) any such exercise, to  the extent that it
relates to an Apple Option that would become  exercisable only at the
Effective Time, will be contingent  until, and will become effective only
upon, the occurrence of  the Effective Time and (B) no Apple Option may be
exercised  after the Exercise Period. 

  



  

  (iii) Apple Options that are not exercised before the end  of the Exercise
Period terminate at the Effective Time. 

  



  

  (iv) All Apple Option Plans will terminate at the Effective  Time. 

  



  

  3.2 __Exchange of  Certificates_._ (a) Prior to the Closing,  Parents
transfer agent will be designated by Parent to act  as the exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ")  for the purpose of exchanging certificates
representing Apple  Common Stock for certificates representing that number of
shares  of Hampton Class A Common Stock that are to be issued  pursuant to
Section 3.1(a). 

  



  

  (b) As soon as practicable, but in any event no later than  five Business
Days following the Effective Time, the Surviving  Corporation will deposit
with the Exchange Agent, as nominee for  the benefit of the Apple
Shareholders, certificates representing  the shares of Hampton Class A Common
Stock to be issued pursuant  to Section 3.1(a) (such shares of Hampton Class
A  Common Stock, together with cash for the payment of any  dividends or
distributions with respect thereto and the  Fractional Share Amount, being
hereinafter referred to as the  " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

  



  

  (c) After the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will  distribute to each
Apple Shareholder (other than holders of  shares of Apple Common Stock that
are cancelled pursuant to  Section 3.1(b)) (i) certificates representing
the  whole number of shares of Hampton Class A Common Stock into  which such
Persons shares of Apple Common Stock have been  converted in accordance with
Section 3.1(a), (ii) the  amount of dividends or other distributions, if any,
with a  record date on or after the Effective Time which theretofore  became
payable with respect to such shares of Hampton  Class A Common Stock, and
(iii) the portion of the  Fractional Share Amount which such Apple
Shareholder has the  right to receive pursuant to the provisions of  Section
3.2(d). In no event will any Apple Shareholder be  entitled to receive
interest on any funds to be received  pursuant to the Merger. From and after
the Effective Time, the  interest of each Apple Shareholder immediately prior
to the  Merger will be limited to the right to receive (A) the  whole number
of shares of Hampton Class A Common Stock into  which the shares of Apple
Common Stock held by such Person have 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  been converted, (B) dividends or other distributions, if  any, and (C) a
portion of the Fractional Share Amount, in  each case, as described above. 

  



  

  (d) Each Apple Shareholder who otherwise would have been  entitled to a
fraction of a share of Hampton Class A Common  Stock upon conversion of such
Persons shares of Apple  Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (after
aggregating  all of such Persons shares of Apple Common Stock  immediately
prior to the Effective Time) will receive from the  Exchange Agent a cash
payment in lieu of such fractional share  of Hampton Class A Common Stock.
Promptly after the  Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will aggregate all
such  fractional shares into whole shares of Hampton Class A  Common Stock,
sell the whole shares of Hampton Class A  Common Stock in the open market on
behalf of holders of record  or beneficial owners who otherwise would be
entitled to receive  fractional shares of Hampton Class A Common Stock and
distribute  to each such holder or for the benefit for each such beneficial 
owner such holders or owners ratable share of the total  proceeds (net of
total selling and conversion expenses) of such  sale (such aggregate amount,
the " _Fractional Share  Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the 
Exchange Agent will have sole discretion to determine when, how,  though
which broker-dealer and at what price to execute the  sales; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that neither the  Exchange Agent nor any broker-dealer used by
the Exchange Agent  will be an affiliate of Parent or Hampton. 

  



  

  (e) All shares of Hampton Class A Common Stock issued  upon conversion of
shares of Apple Common Stock in accordance  with the terms hereof will be
deemed to have been issued at the  Effective Time in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to  such shares of Apple Common Stock. 

  



  

  (f) If any certificate representing shares of Hampton  Class A Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than  the name of the Apple Shareholder
entitled to such shares of  Hampton Class A Common Stock, it will be a
condition to the  issuance thereof that appropriate transfer documentation, 
reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent, be presented to the  Exchange
Agent and that the Person requesting such issuance pay  to the Exchange Agent
in advance any transfer or other Taxes  required by reason of such issuance
or for any other reason, or  establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such  Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  



  

  (g) The Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct  and withhold
from the shares of Hampton Class A Common  Stock, any dividends or
distributions thereon or otherwise  payable hereunder to any Apple
Shareholder, and any portion of  the Fractional Share Amount, such amounts as
it is required to  deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment  under any provisions of income tax Law. To the extent that the 
Surviving Corporation so withholds those amounts, such withheld  amounts will
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as  having been paid to the
Apple Shareholder in respect of the  shares for which such deduction and
withholding was made by the  Surviving Corporation. 

  



  

  (h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed  by Apple
Shareholders one year after the Effective Time will be  delivered to the
Surviving Corporation together with any  interest or other income accrued
through such time as a result  of the investments described in Section
3.2(j), and any  such Apple Shareholders who have not theretofore complied
with  this Section 3.2 will thereafter look only to the Surviving 
Corporation for payment of the shares of Hampton Class A  Common Stock, any
portion of the Fractional Share Amount and any  unpaid dividends or
distributions thereon deliverable in respect  of each share of Apple Common
Stock, without any interest  thereon. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining  unclaimed by Apple Shareholders that would otherwise escheat to 
or become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the  extent permitted
by applicable Laws, become the property of the  Surviving Corporation free
and clear of any claims or interest  of any Person previously entitled
thereto. 

  



  

  (i) None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent,  Parents transfer agent,
the Exchange Agent or any other  Person will be liable to any Apple
Shareholder for any shares of  Hampton Class A Common Stock, any dividend or
other  distribution with respect thereto or any portion of the  Fractional
Share Amount delivered in good faith to a  Governmental Entity pursuant to
applicable abandoned property,  escheat or similar applicable Laws. 

  



  

  (j) The Exchange Agent will invest any cash included in the  Exchange Fund
as directed by the Surviving Corporation, on a  daily basis. Any interest and
other income resulting from such  investments will be paid to the Surviving
Corporation promptly  upon request by the Surviving Corporation and as set
forth in  Section 3.2(h).

outstanding or authorized  options, warrants, rights, calls, subscriptions,
claims of any  character, convertible or exchangeable securities, or other 
Contracts, contingent or otherwise, relating to Parent Common  Stock or any
capital stock equivalent or other nominal interest  in Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries which relate to Parent  (collectively, " _Parent Equity
Interests_ ")  pursuant to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or
may  become obligated to issue shares of its capital stock or other  equity
interests or any securities convertible into or  exchangeable for, or
evidencing the right to subscribe for, any  Parent Equity Interests. Except
as provided in the Parent  Certificate of Incorporation and the Parent
Stockholders  Agreement, there are no Contracts to which Parent is a party 
relating to the issuance, sale, transfer or voting of any equity  securities
or other securities of Parent.

Hampton. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, there  will be one-half of
one share of Hampton Class A Common  Stock issued and outstanding, and a one-
half of one share of  Hampton Class B Common Stock, issued and outstanding,
for  each share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding. At the 
Closing, all issued outstanding shares of Hampton Common Stock  shall have
been duly authorized and validly issued and fully  paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights. At the  Closing, except for shares issuable
pursuant to this Agreement  and the Spin Off Agreement, there will be no
outstanding  options, warrants, rights, calls, subscriptions, claims of any 
character, convertible or exchangeable securities, or other  Contracts,
contingent or otherwise, relating to Hampton Common  Stock or any capital
stock equivalent or other nominal interest  in Hampton which relate to
Hampton (" _Hampton Equity  Interests_ ") pursuant to which Hampton is or may
become  obligated to issue shares of its 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  capital stock or other equity interests or any securities  convertible
into or exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to  subscribe for, any
Hampton Equity Interests. At the Closing,  there will be no outstanding
obligations of Hampton to  repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
outstanding  securities of Hampton or any Hampton Equity Interests. Except

(ii) no bonds, debentures,  notes or other indebtedness having the right to
vote on any  matters on which Hampton Common Stock holders may vote will be 
issued or outstanding, and (iii) no obligations of Hampton  to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding  securities of Hampton or any
Hampton Equity Interests will be  outstanding. 

  



  

  (c) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital  stock or other
equity ownership interests of each Subsidiary of  Hampton are, or at the
Closing will be, owned by Hampton,  directly or indirectly, free and clear of
any material  Encumbrances, and all of such shares or equity ownership 
interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully  paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. No such  Subsidiary has or is
bound by any outstanding subscriptions,  options, warrants, calls,
commitments or Contracts of any nature  calling for the purchase or issuance
of any shares of capital  stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary or any  securities representing the right to purchase or
otherwise  receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security 
of such Subsidiary. Each subsidiary of Hampton constitutes a  Subsidiary of
Hampton as defined in this Agreement. 

  



  

  4.6 __Absence of Certain  Events_._ Except as required or expressly 
permitted by this Agreement, the Spin Off Agreement or as  reflected in the
Hampton Financial Statements, since  December 31, 2005, Hampton and its
Subsidiaries have  operated their respective businesses only in the ordinary
course  of business and there has not occurred any event, occurrence or 
condition which (i) would have been a breach of  Section 6.2 had such Section
6.2 been in effect since  December 31, 2005 or (ii) would, individually or
in  the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Hampton Material 
Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  4.7 __Litigation_._ There are  no Actions pending against Hampton or any
of its Subsidiaries  or, to the Knowledge of Hampton, threatened against
Parent or  Hampton or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective 
properties, rights or franchises), at law or in equity, or  before or by any
Governmental Entity that would, individually or  in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Hampton  Material Adverse Effect and, to the Knowledge
of Hampton, no  development has occurred with respect to any pending or 
threatened Action that, individually or in the aggregate, would  reasonably
be expected to have a Hampton Material Adverse  Effect. Neither Hampton nor
any of its Subsidiaries is subject  to any Orders that, individually or in
the aggregate, would  reasonably be expected to have a Hampton Material
Adverse  Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not 
administer any of Hamptons or its Subsidiaries  pending or threatened
Actions. 

  



  

  4.8 __Title to Properties;  Encumbrances_._ Each of Hampton and its 
Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or, in the case of  leased
properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all  of the tangible
properties and assets used by Hampton or its  Subsidiaries in the conduct of
their businesses except where the  failure to have such good and valid title
or valid leasehold  interests, as applicable, would not, individually or in
the  aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Hampton Material  Adverse
Effect, in each case subject to no Encumbrances, except  for (a) Encumbrances
consisting of zoning or planning  restrictions, easements, permits and other
restrictions or  limitations on the use of real property or irregularities

after  the date of this Agreement, contain any untrue statement of a 
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be  stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made  therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected by a  subsequent
Parent SEC Report filed with the SEC prior to the  date of this Agreement.

2005. Attached to  Section 4.9(c)-2  of the Hampton Disclosure Schedule are
the unaudited financial  statements of Hampton as of and for the period

respects the consolidated  financial position and consolidated results of
operations of  Hampton and its Subsidiaries, as of the respective dates
thereof  and for the respective periods indicated therein, except as 
otherwise noted therein and subject in the case of the Hampton  Interim

exclusive  ownership and direct control of Hampton or its Subsidiaries, 
except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control  that would not
have a material adverse effect on the system of  internal accounting controls
described in the following  sentence. Hampton and its Subsidiaries have (i)
devised and  maintain a system of internal controls over financial
reporting  sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of  financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, (ii) designed  disclosure controls and
procedures to ensure that material  information relating to Hampton,
including its Subsidiaries, is  made known to management of Hampton by others

and have identified  for Hamptons auditors any material weaknesses in
internal  controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that 
involves management or other employees who have a significant  role in

Code. 

  



  

  (c) To the Knowledge of Parent and Hampton, as of the date  of this
Agreement, none of Parent, Hampton, or any of their  respective Subsidiaries

qualify for  tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368 and related 
provisions of the Code.

Material Adverse  Effect. No consent of any third party will be required for
the  use by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries of the  Hampton
Intellectual Property after the Effective Time. There  are no claims asserted
in writing by any Person against Hampton  or any of its Subsidiaries
regarding the ownership of or the  right to use any Hampton Intellectual
Property or challenging  the rights of Hampton or any of its Subsidiaries

Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Hampton,  as of the date hereof,
there is no infringement or  misappropriation of the Hampton Intellectual
Property by any  Person.

Environmental Law, nor are there any  such liabilities or obligations pending
or, to the Knowledge of  Hampton, threatened against Hampton or any of its

_Apple Disclosure  Schedule_ ") delivered by Apple to Parent and Hampton in 
connection with the execution of this Agreement (which schedule  sets forth,
among other things, items the disclosure of which is  necessary or
appropriate either in response to an express  disclosure requirement
contained in a provision hereof or as an  exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained  in this Article V), Apple hereby
represents and warrants to  Parent and Hampton as follows:

corporation duly  organized, validly existing and in good standing or has 
equivalent status under the laws of the State of Florida and has  all

duly qualified or licensed to do  business and is in good standing or has
equivalent status in  each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased
or  operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it  makes such
qualification necessary, except in such jurisdictions  where the failure to

status would not, individually or  in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have an Apple  Material Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  5.2 __Authorization and Validity of  Agreement_._ Apple has the requisite
corporate  power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to 
perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of  this
Agreement by Apple, and the consummation by Apple of the  Merger, have been
duly authorized and approved by its board of  directors and, except for the
Apple Shareholder Approval, no  other corporate action on the part of Apple
is necessary to  authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the  consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly  executed and
delivered by Apple and is a valid and binding  obligation of Apple
enforceable against Apple in accordance with  its terms, except to the extent
that its enforceability may be  subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization,  moratorium and similar Laws affecting the enforcement of 
creditors rights generally and by general equitable  principles.

violate or conflict with any Law or Order applicable  to Apple or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which any of their  respective properties or assets may be

material benefit under, any of the terms, conditions or  provisions of any
Contract to which Apple or any of its  Subsidiaries is a party, or by which

rights of termination, cancellations,  accelerations, increases, losses,
creations and impositions of  Encumbrances which would not, individually or
in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have an Apple Material Adverse
Effect.

supplied by or on behalf of Apple for inclusion or incorporation  by
reference in the Proxy Statement, the  Form S-4  or in any other document
filed with any Governmental Entity in  connection with the Transactions will
not, on the date of their  filing or, in the case of the  Form S-4,  at the
time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, or on  the date the Proxy
Statement is mailed or at the time of the  Apple Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a  material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements  therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
are  made, not misleading. 

  



  

  5.5 __Capitalization of Apple_._  

  



  

  (a) The authorized capital stock of Apple consists of  75,000,000 shares
of common stock, $0.10 par value per  share (the " _Apple Common Stock_ ").
As of the  Measurement Date, there were 24,492,069 shares of Apple  Common
Stock issued and outstanding, and 1,712,827 shares  of Apple Common Stock
were reserved for issuance upon the  exercise of outstanding options (the "
_Apple  Options_ ") for Apple Common Stock. Between the  Measurement Date
and the date hereof, Apple has not issued any  shares of Apple Common Stock
(other than pursuant to the  exercise of Apple Options). All issued and
outstanding shares of  Apple Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued  and are fully paid and nonassessable. As of the date hereof,
and  except for shares of Apple Common Stock issuable pursuant to the  Apple
Options, there are no outstanding or authorized options,  warrants, rights,
calls, subscriptions, claims of any character,  convertible or exchangeable
securities, or other Contracts,  contingent or otherwise, relating to Apple
Common Stock or any  capital stock equivalent or other nominal interest in
Apple or  any of its Subsidiaries which relate to Apple (collectively,  "
_Apple Equity Interests_ ") pursuant to which  Apple or any of its
Subsidiaries is or may become obligated to  issue shares of its capital stock
or other equity interests or  any securities convertible into, or
exchangeable for, or  evidencing the right to subscribe for, any Apple
Equity  Interests. There are no outstanding obligations of Apple to 
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding  securities of Apple
or any Apple Equity Interests. There are no  Contracts to which Apple is a
party relating to the issuance,  sale, transfer, or voting of any equity
securities or other  securities of Apple. No bonds, debentures, notes or
other  indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on which  Apple
Shareholders may vote are issued or outstanding as of the  date hereof. 

  



  

  (b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital  stock or other
equity ownership interests of each Subsidiary of  Apple are owned by Apple,
directly or indirectly, free and clear  of any material Encumbrances, and all
of such shares or equity  ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and  are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. No 
such Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding  subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or  Contracts of any nature calling for the
purchase or issuance of  any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such  Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase  or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other 
equity security of such Subsidiary. 

  



  

  (c) The exercise price of each Apple Option is equal to or  greater than
the fair market value of the Apple Common Stock on  the date of the grant of
such Apple Option. The grant date of  each Apple Option is on or after the
date on which such grant  was authorized by the Apple Board of Directors. The
terms of  each of the option agreements for each optionee permit the 
treatment of each such option described in Section 3.1(d).  Except as set
forth in _Schedule 5.5(c)_, the terms of  each of the option agreements for
each optionee are  substantially similar to the forms attached to  Section
5.5(c) of the Apple Disclosure Schedule, and no  such option agreement
provides for any payment or other transfer  from Apple or any Affiliate of
Apple or for any 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  adjustment to the terms of the option in connection with the  transaction
contemplated by this Agreement that is not provided  for in such forms. 

  



  

  (d) Each subsidiary of Apple constitutes a Subsidiary of  Apple as defined
in this Agreement. 

  



  

  5.6 __Absence of Certain  Events_._ Except as required or expressly 
permitted by this Agreement or as reflected in the Apple  Financial
Statements, since December 31, 2005, Apple and  its Subsidiaries have
operated their respective businesses only  in the ordinary course of business
and there has not occurred  any event, occurrence or condition which (i)
would have  been a breach of Section 6.1 had such Section 6.1 been  in
effect since December 31, 2005, or (ii) would,  individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have  an Apple Material Adverse
Effect. 

  



  

  5.7 __Litigation_._ There are no  Actions pending against Apple or any of
its Subsidiaries or, to  the Knowledge of Apple, threatened against Apple or
any of its  Subsidiaries (or any of their respective properties, rights or 
franchises), at law or in equity, or before or by any  Governmental Entity,
that would, individually or in the  aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
an Apple Material  Adverse Effect, and, to the Knowledge of Apple, no
development  has occurred with respect to any pending or threatened Action 
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be  expected to have
an Apple Material Adverse Effect. Neither Apple  nor any of its Subsidiaries
are subject to any Orders that,  individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected  to have an Apple Material Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  5.8 __Title to Properties;  Encumbrances_._ Each of Apple and its 
Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or, in the case of  leased
properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all  of its tangible
properties and assets except where the failure  to have such good and valid
title or valid leasehold interests,  as applicable, would not, individually
or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have an Apple Material
Adverse Effect,  in each case subject to no Encumbrances, except for  (a)
Encumbrances consisting of zoning or planning  restrictions, easements,
permits and other restrictions or  limitations on the use of real property or
irregularities in  title thereto which do not materially detract from the
value of,  or impair the use of, such property by Apple or any of its 
Subsidiaries, (b) Encumbrances for current Taxes,  assessments or
governmental charges or levies on property not  yet due or which are being
contested in good faith and for which  appropriate reserves in accordance
with GAAP have been created,  and (c) Encumbrances which would not,
individually or in  the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Apple
Material  Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  5.9 __Apple SEC Reports; Financial  Statements_._  

  



  

  (a) Each of Apple and its Subsidiaries has timely filed  with the SEC all
registration statements, prospectuses, reports,  schedules, forms, proxy
statements, certifications and other  documents (including exhibits and all
other information  incorporated by reference therein) required to be filed by
Apple  since January 1, 2003 (the " _Apple SEC  Reports_ "). The Apple SEC
Reports (i) were prepared  in all material respects in accordance with the
requirements of  the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and  (ii) did not at the time they were filed and will not, when  filed
after the date of this Agreement, contain any untrue  statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact  required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the  statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under  which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent  corrected by a subsequent Apple SEC Report filed with the SEC  prior
to the date of this Agreement. No Subsidiary of Apple is  subject to the
periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange  Act by Law or Contract. 

  



  

  (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements of Apple  (including, in
each case, any notes thereto) contained in the  Apple SEC Reports (the "
_Apple Financial  Statements_ ") was prepared in accordance with GAAP 
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and presented  fairly in
all material respects the consolidated financial  position and consolidated
results of operations of Apple and its  Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and for the  respective periods indicated therein, except as
otherwise noted  therein and subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to  normal year-end audit adjustments in amounts that are immaterial  in
nature and amounts consistent with past experience. The books  and records of
Apple and its Subsidiaries (i) have been,  and are being, maintained in
accordance with GAAP and any other  applicable legal 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  and accounting requirements, (ii) reflect only actual  transactions, (iii)
are complete and accurate in all  material respects, and (iv) reflect in
reasonable detail  all material transactions to which Apple is a party. 

  



  

  (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of  Apple and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and  operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or  photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are  under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of Apple or its  Subsidiaries, except for any non-exclusive ownership
and  non-direct control that would not have a material adverse effect  on
the system of internal accounting controls described in the  following
sentence. Apple and its Subsidiaries have devised and  maintain a system of
internal controls over financial reporting  sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of  financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Apple (i) has 
designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that  material
information relating to Apple, including its  consolidated Subsidiaries, is
made known to its management by  others within those entities and (ii) has
disclosed, based  on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof,
to  Apples auditors and the audit committee of Apples  board of directors
(A) any significant deficiencies in the  design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely  affect in any material respect Apples
ability to record,  process, summarize and report financial data and have
identified  for Apples auditors any material weaknesses in internal 
controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that  involves
management or other employees who have a significant  role in Apples
internal controls. Apple has made available  to Parent a summary of each such
disclosure made by management  to its auditors and audit committee since
January 1, 2005. 

  



  

  5.10 __No Undisclosed  Liabilities_._ Except for those liabilities  that
are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated  financial statements
of Apple as of and for the period ended  March 31, 2006 included in Apples 
Form 10-Q  for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, including the notes 
thereto, since such date, neither Apple nor any of its  Subsidiaries has
incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever  (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether  due or to become due and including any
off-balance sheet  financings, loans, indebtedness, make whole or similar 
liabilities or obligations) that would be required to be  reflected in a
consolidated balance sheet of Apple prepared in  accordance with GAAP, except
for liabilities incurred in the  ordinary course of business that would not,
individually or in  the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Apple
Material  Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  5.11 __Compliance with Law_._  

  



  

  (a) Each of Apple and its Subsidiaries is, and since  January 1, 2005, has
been, in compliance with all Laws and  Orders applicable to it, except where
the failure to so comply  would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be  expected to have an Apple Material Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  (b) Each of Apple and its Subsidiaries holds, to the extent  legally
required, all Permits that are required for the lawful  operation of its
business as now conducted, except where the  failure to hold any such Permit
would not, individually or in  the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
an Apple Material  Adverse Effect, and there has not occurred any default
under any  such Permit, except to the extent that such default would not, 
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have  an Apple
Material Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  5.12 __Insurance_._ Apple and  its Subsidiaries maintain insurance
coverage with reputable  insurers in such amounts and covering such risks as
are in  accordance with normal industry practice for companies engaged  in
businesses similar to that of Apple and its Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  5.13 __Regulatory Matters_._  

  



  

  (a) Except for such of the following as would not,  individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have  an Apple Material Adverse Effect,
there are no facts: 

  



  

  (i) which would furnish a substantial basis for the recall,  withdrawal or
suspension of any products of Apple or its  Subsidiaries by any competent
Governmental Entity; or 

  



  

  (ii) which would otherwise reasonably be expected to cause  Apple or its
Subsidiaries to withdraw, recall or suspend any  products of Apple or its
Subsidiaries from the market or to  change the marketing classification of
any products of Apple or  its Subsidiaries or to terminate or suspend testing
of any  products of Apple or its Subsidiaries. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  (b) There are no: 

  



  

  (i) products which have been recalled by Apple or its  Subsidiaries
(whether voluntarily or otherwise) at any time  since January 1, 2004; or 

  



  

  (ii) Actions pending, or to the Knowledge of Apple,  contemplated or
threatened, and no such Actions have been  settled or resolved since January
1, 2004, seeking the  recall, suspension or seizure of any products of Apple
or its  Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  (c) Since January 1, 2004, Apple and each of its  Subsidiaries has timely
filed or submitted all reports, filings,  applications and notifications
required by statutes or  regulations administered by the U.S. Consumer
Products  Safety Commission including, without limitation, 15 U.S.C.  §§
2064(b) and 2084) and any other  Governmental Entity with respect to the
manufacture,  distribution and safety of any products manufactured,
imported,  distributed or sold by Apple or any of its Subsidiaries. Each 
such report, filing, application and notification complied, at  the time of
such filing or submission, in all material respects,  with the requirements
for such report, filing, application and  notification, and has been
supplemented to the extent required  by applicable law or regulation. 

  



  

  5.14 __Broker s or Finders  Fee_._ Except for Banc of America
Securities  LLC and Capital Link LLC, to which only Apple has any liability 
or obligation, no Person acting on behalf of Apple or any of its 
Subsidiaries is, or will be, entitled to any investment banking,  brokers,
finders or similar fee for which Parent,  Hampton, Apple or any of their
respective Affiliates or the  Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time
could have any  liabilities in connection with this Agreement, the
Ancillary  Agreements or any of the Transactions. 

  



  

  5.15 __Taxes, Tax Returns, Tax Treatment__  

  



  

  (a) Apple and each of its subsidiaries has duly filed all  Tax Returns
required to be filed by it on or prior to the date  of this Agreement (all
such returns being accurate and complete  in all material respects) and has
duly paid or made provision  for the payment of all Taxes that have been
incurred or are due  or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign
or local  Tax Authorities other than (i) Taxes that (a) are not  yet
delinquent or (b) are being contested in good faith,  have not been finally
determined and have been adequately  reserved against or (ii) Tax Returns or
Taxes as to which  the failure to file, pay or make provision for would
not,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have  an
Apple Material Adverse Effect. The period (including any  extensions) within
which the IRS may assess federal income Taxes  against Apple and its
subsidiaries has closed with respect to  all taxable years through and
including the fiscal year ended  December 31, 1998 and any liability with
respect thereto  has been satisfied. There are no disputes pending, or
claims  asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon Apple or any of its 
subsidiaries for which Apple does not have adequate reserves  that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be  expected to have an Apple
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Apple  nor any of its subsidiaries is a
party to or is bound by any Tax  sharing, allocation or indemnification
agreement or arrangement  (other than such an agreement or arrangement
exclusively between  or among Apple and its subsidiaries or as described in
the  Ancillary Agreements). Within the past two years, neither Apple  nor
any of its subsidiaries has been a "distributing  corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a  distribution intended to qualify under Section
355(a) of  the Code. No disallowance of a deduction under  Sections 162(m)
or 280G of the Code for employee  remuneration of any amount paid or payable
by Apple or any of  its subsidiaries under any contract, plan, program or 
arrangement or understanding would, individually or in the  aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have an Apple Material  Adverse Effect. Apple and
its subsidiaries have complied with  the requirements of Code Section 409A
(and its related  reporting and withholding requirements), for all amounts
paid or  payable under any contract, plan, program or arrangement or 
understanding except where such failure to comply would not,  individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have  an Apple Material Adverse
Effect. 

  



  

  (b) None of Apple or any of its subsidiaries has taken or  failed to take
any action, or has Knowledge of any facts or  circumstances, that would
prevent the Merger from constituting a  tax-free reorganization described in
Section 368(a) and  related provisions of the Code. 

  



  

  (c) To the Knowledge of Apple, as of the date of this  Agreement, none of
Apple or any of its subsidiaries or  controlled Affiliates is aware of any
fact that would reasonably  be expected to cause the tax treatment of the 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Spin Off or the Merger to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment  under
Sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the  Code. 

  



  

  5.16 __Employee Benefit  Matters_._  

  



  

  (a) Section 5.16 of the Apple Disclosure Schedule sets  forth a true and
complete list of each benefit or compensation  plan, arrangement or
agreement, and any bonus, incentive,  deferred compensation, vacation, stock
purchase, stock option,  severance, employment, change of control or fringe

or  timely filed for a favorable determination letter from the IRS  with
respect to all changes in applicable Law for which certain  qualified plans
were required to be amended, and there are no  existing circumstances or any
events that have occurred that  will adversely affect the qualified status of
any such Apple  Benefit Plan, (iii) no Apple Benefit Plan is a  "defined
benefit plan" as defined in  Section 3(35) of ERISA, (iv) no Apple Benefit
Plan  provides benefits coverage, including death or medical benefits

employees, consultants, leased employees or directors of  Apple or its
Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other  termination of service, other

calendar month in  which retirement or other termination of service occurs, 
(v) no Apple Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension  plan" (as such term is
defined in Section 3(37) of  ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" (as such

(vi) none of Apple or its Subsidiaries or, to  the Knowledge of Apple, any
other person, including any  fiduciary, has engaged in a transaction in
connection with which  Apple, its Subsidiaries or any Apple Benefit Plan
would  reasonably be expected to be subject to either a material civil 
penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA  or a material
Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976  of the Code, (vii) to the
Knowledge of Apple,  (A) there are no pending, threatened or anticipated
claims  (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or 
against any of the Apple Benefit Plans or any trusts or other  funding
vehicles related thereto and (B) no administrative  investigation, audit or
proceeding is pending or in progress  with respect to the Apple Benefit
Plans, (viii) all  contributions or other amounts payable by Apple or its 
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time with respect to each Apple  Benefit
Plan in respect of current or former plan years have  been paid or accrued in
accordance with GAAP and  Section 412 of the Code and, other than transfers
incident  to an incentive stock option plan within the meaning of  Section
422 of the Code or as restricted under  Section 162(m) of the Code have been
or are fully  deductible under the Code, (ix) with respect to any  insurance
policy providing funding for benefits under any Apple  Benefit Plan, (A)

terminate each of  the Apple Benefit Plans, without the consent of any
other  Person, and (xi) no Apple Benefit Plan provides benefits to  any

Apple Foreign Plan); (ii) the Apple  Financial Statements accurately reflect
the Apple Foreign Plan  liabilities and accruals for contributions required
to be paid  to the Apple Foreign Plans, in accordance with GAAP,  (iii)

threatened, with respect to any Apple Foreign Plan. 

  



  

  (d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement  nor the

any other event) (i) result in any  payment (including severance,

  (a) Following the Effective Time, none of the Surviving  Corporation or
any of its Affiliates will take any action, cause  any action to be taken,

Code. 

  



  

  (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving  Corporation
will make available to each other during normal  business hours, but without

relating to commitments, contracts, titles  and financial position, or
otherwise pertaining to the business  and affairs, of Apple or Hampton, as

  (b) No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.8 will  affect any
representation or warranty given by any party  hereunder, and,

expressly set forth in this  Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
party will be  required to provide any information which it reasonably
believes  it may not provide to the other party by reason of applicable 
Law, which such party reasonably believes constitutes  information protected
by attorney/client privilege or the  attorney work product doctrine or which
it is required to keep  confidential by reason of Contracts with third
parties. The  parties hereto will make reasonable and appropriate
substitute  disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the 
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Each of Parent,  Apple and

connection with the registration under the Securities Act of  the shares of
Hampton Class A Common Stock to be issued to  the Apple Shareholders pursuant

not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The  parties hereto will advise
each other, promptly after any of  them receives notice thereof, of the time
which the  Form S-4  has become effective or any supplement or amendment has
been  filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the 
qualification of the Hampton Class A Common Stock issuable  in connection
with the Merger for offering or sale in any  jurisdiction, or any request by

S-4,  the Proxy Statement and the Additional Filings (including by  reason
of any SEC comments thereto or subsequent requests  thereon). If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any  information relating to Apple or any of its
respective  Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
Apple  which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the  Form
S-4,  the Proxy Statement or the Additional Filings so that any of  such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material  fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the  statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under  which they were made, not misleading, Apple
will promptly notify  Parent and Hampton and, to the extent required by
applicable  Laws, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such 
information will be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated  to the
Apple Shareholders. 

  



  

  (d) Each of Parent and Hampton will provide Apple with the  information
concerning itself and its Subsidiaries, including  financial statements and
other financial information, in the  form required to be included in the 
Form S-4,  the Proxy Statement and the Additional Filings (including by 
reason of any SEC comments thereto or subsequent requests  thereon). If at

Hampton or its officers or  directors, should be discovered by Parent or
Hampton and such  information should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to  the  Form S-4,  Proxy Statement or the Additional Filings so
that any of such  documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact  or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the  statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under  which they were made, not
misleading, Parent or Hampton, as  applicable, will promptly notify Apple
and, to the extent  required by applicable Laws, an appropriate amendment
or  supplement describing such information will be promptly filed  with the
SEC and disseminated to the Apple Shareholders. 

  



  

  (e) All documents that any of Parent, Hampton and Apple is  responsible
for filing with the SEC in connection with the  Transactions will comply as

requirements of the  Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
and the  Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

  



  

  6.12 __No Solicitation_._  

  



  

  (a) Apple will immediately cease, terminate and discontinue  any
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted before  the date of
this Agreement with respect to any Apple Competing  Transaction, and will
promptly, following the execution of this  Agreement, request the return or
destruction (as provided in the  applicable agreement) of all confidential
information provided  by or on behalf of Apple to all Persons who have had
such  discussions or negotiations or who have entered into  confidentiality
agreements with Apple pertaining to an Apple  Competing Transaction. 

  



  

  (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Apple will not, and will  cause its
Affiliates and representatives not to, directly or  indirectly solicit,
initiate or encourage any inquiries or  proposals from, discuss or negotiate
with, or provide any  non-public information to, any Person (other than
Parent,  Hampton and their respective representatives) relating to any 
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or  other
transaction or 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  series of transactions involving Apple that is conditioned on  the
termination of this Agreement or could reasonably be  expected to preclude or
materially delay the completion of the  Merger (an " _Apple Competing
Transaction_ "). 

  



  

  (c) Apple will promptly (and in any event within  24 hours) notify Parent
of its or any of its  officers, directors or representatives receipt  of
any inquiry or proposal relating to, an Apple Competing  Transaction,
including the identity of the Person submitting  such inquiry or proposal and
the terms thereof. 

  



  

  (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, Apple or
its board of directors will be permitted to  engage in any discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any  information to, any Person in response to
an unsolicited bona  fide written offer regarding an Apple Competing
Transaction by  any such Person (which has not been withdrawn), if and only
to  the extent that, (i) the Apple Shareholder Approval has not  been given,
(ii) Apple has received an unsolicited bona  fide written offer regarding an
Apple Competing Transaction from  a third party (which has not been
withdrawn) and its board of  directors has determined in good faith that
there is a  reasonable likelihood that such Apple Competing Transaction 
would constitute a Apple Superior Proposal, (iii) its board  of directors,
after consultation with its outside counsel,  determines in good faith that
such action is required by its  fiduciary duties, (iv) prior to providing any
information  or data to any Person in connection with an Apple Competing 
Transaction by any such Person, it receives from such Person an  executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms Apple  determines to be
substantially the same as the Confidentiality  Agreement (but permitting the
disclosures to Parent described in  this Section 6.12(d) to be made to
Parent), and  (iv) prior to providing any information or data to any  Person
or entering into discussions or negotiations with any  Person, it complies
with Section 6.12(c). Apple will use  its commercially reasonable efforts to
keep Parent informed  promptly of the status and terms of any such proposal
or offer  and the status and terms of any such discussions or negotiations 
and will promptly provide Parent with any such written proposal  or offer.
Apple will promptly inform its directors, officers,  key employees, agents
and representatives of the obligations  undertaken by Apple in this Section
6.12. Nothing in this  Section 6.12(d), (x) permits Apple to terminate this 
Agreement (except as specifically provided in  Article VIII) or (y) affects
any other obligation  of Apple or Parent under this Agreement. 

  



  

  (e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Apple Superior  Proposal_ " means a
bona fide written offer regarding an  Apple Competing Transaction made by a
Person other than a party  hereto or its controlled Affiliates which is on
terms which the  board of directors of Apple concludes, after consultation
with  its financial advisors and following receipt of the advice of  its
outside counsel, would, if consummated, result in a  transaction that is more
favorable to the Apple Shareholders  than the Transactions. 

  



  

  (f) No provision of this Agreement will be deemed to  prohibit (i) Apple
from publicly disclosing any information  which its board of directors
determines, after consultation with  outside counsel, is required to be
disclosed by Law, whether  pursuant to the federal securities laws, state law
fiduciary  requirements or otherwise, or (ii) the Apple board of  directors
from changing its recommendation in respect of the  Merger if it determines,
after consultation with outside  counsel, that such action is required by its
fiduciary duties;  provided, however, that nothing in the preceding  clause
(ii) will relieve Apple of its obligations with  respect to the Apple
Shareholders Meeting under Sections 6.10 or  8.3. 

  



  

  6.13 __Notification of Certain  Matters_._ Each of Hampton and Apple will
give  prompt written notice to the other of (a) any notice or  other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of  such Person is or
may be required in connection with the  Transactions, (b) any Action
commenced or threatened in  writing against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting  it or any of its Subsidiaries that relates to the
consummation  of the Transactions, and (c) any change that would  reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the  aggregate, a Hampton Material
Adverse Effect or an Apple  Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.
Hampton will give  Apple prompt written notice of (i) any material change
in  method of accounting not required by a Governmental Entity or by 
changes in GAAP as concurred in by Hamptons independent  public accountants,
and (ii) any material Tax election or  settlement or compromise of any
material income Tax liability  with respect to matters that will be a
liability of the  Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries following
the  Merger. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  6.14 __Listing_._ Hampton and  Parent will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause  the shares of Hampton Class A Common Stock to be

NASDAQ as of the Effective Time, subject to official notice of  issuance. 

  



  

  6.15 __Covenant Not to  Compete_._ For a period of four years after the 
Closing Date, neither Parent nor any of its controlled  Affiliates will,
without the prior written consent of the  Surviving Corporation, directly or
indirectly, engage in the  Restricted Business anywhere in the Territory;
provided,  however, that the foregoing will not restrict Parent or any of 
its controlled Affiliates from: 

  



  

  (i) becoming an owner of less than 5% of the outstanding  stock of any
publicly traded corporation that engages in the  Restricted Business; 

  



  

  (ii) acquiring and operating a Person engaged in the  Restricted Business
provided that, at the time of such  acquisition the annual revenue

  (iii) engaging in the Restricted Business after the four  anniversary of
the Closing Date; and 

  



  

  (iv) continuing the ownership and operation of The Kitchen  Collection,
Inc. in a manner consistent with past practice.

waste disposal devices. The parties agree that the  covenants included in
this Section 6.15 are, taken as a  whole, reasonable in their geographic and
temporal coverage and  no party will raise any issue of geographic or
temporal  reasonableness in any proceeding to enforce such covenants. 
Parent acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach by  Parent or
any of its controlled Affiliates of the provisions of  this Section 6.15,
monetary damages will not constitute a  sufficient remedy. Consequently, in
the event of any such  breach, the Surviving Corporation may, in addition to
any other  rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of 
law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance  and/or 
injunctive relief or other relief in order to enforce or prevent  any
violation of the provisions hereof. 

  



  

  6.16 __Fees and  Expenses_._ Except for filing fees paid under  Antitrust

equally by Apple and Hampton, (a) Apple will bear all of  the Expenses of
Apple and its Affiliates (for the avoidance of  doubt, excluding for this
purpose Hampton and its subsidiaries),  including the brokers or finders
fees referred to in  Section 5.14, (b) Parent will bear all of the Expenses 
of Parent and its Affiliates (other than Hampton and its  subsidiaries),

  6.17 __Directors  and Officers  Indemnification and Insurance_._  

  



  

  (a) In the event of any threatened or actual Action,  whether civil or
administrative, including any such Action in  which any present or former
director or officer of Apple or any  of its subsidiaries (together, the "
_Indemnified  Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party  based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out  of, or pertaining in
whole or in part to, any action or failure  to take action by any such Person
in such capacity taken prior  to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation (the  " _Indemnifying Party_ ") will, from and after the 
Effective Time, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, as and to  the fullest
extent permitted or required by applicable Law in  effect on the date of this
Agreement, against any losses,  claims, damages, liabilities, costs, legal
and other expenses  (including reimbursement for legal and other fees and
expenses  incurred in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, 
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party),  judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and  reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with  such claim Action, subject to the
Surviving Corporations  receipt of an undertaking 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and  expenses
paid in advance if it is ultimately determined that  such Indemnified Party
is not entitled to be indemnified under  applicable Law; provided, however,
that the Surviving  Corporation will not be liable for any settlement
effected  without the Surviving Corporations prior written consent  (which
will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld) and will  not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one  counsel (selected by a plurality
of the applicable Indemnified  Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with  respect to any single such Action, except to the extent
that two  or more of such Indemnified Parties have conflicting interests  in
the outcome of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or  investigation. 

  



  

  (b) The Surviving Corporation will (i) maintain in  effect for a period of
six years after the Effective Time, if  available, the current policies of
directors and  officers liability insurance maintained by Apple (provided 
that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefore policies  of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and  conditions which are not
less advantageous to the directors and  officers of Apple) or (ii) obtain as
of the Effective Time  "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of
six  years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage  and
amounts and containing terms and conditions which are no  less advantageous
to the directors and officers of Apple, in  each case, with respect to claims
arising out of or relating to  events which occurred before or at the
Effective Time; provided,  however, that in no event will the Surviving
Corporation be  required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in
excess  of 250% of the last annual premium paid by Apple for such  insurance
prior to the date of this Agreement (the  " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such
insurance coverage  cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an
annual  premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, the Surviving  Corporation
will obtain that amount of directors and  officers insurance (or "tail"
coverage)  obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. 

  



  

  (c) The provisions of this Section 6.17 will survive  the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will  be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and its successors and  representatives after the Effective
Time and their rights under  this Section 6.17 are in addition to, and will
not be  deemed to be exclusive of, any other rights to which an  Indemnified
Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract  or otherwise. 

  



  

  (d) The obligations under this Section 6.17 may not be  terminated or
modified by the Surviving Corporation in a manner  as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this  Section 6.17 applies without the consent of
the affected  Indemnified Party. In the event that the Surviving
Corporation  or any of their respective successors or assigns  (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Persons or  (ii) transfers 50% or
more of its properties or assets to  any Person, then and in each case,
proper provision will be made  so that the applicable successors, assigns or
transferees assume  the obligations set forth in this Section 6.17. 

  



  

  6.18 __Intellectual Property  Transfers_._ Apple will take such action as
may  be necessary or proper, including filing all required  applications and
executing any necessary transfer documentation,  at its sole cost and
expense, to cause all Apple Intellectual  Property to be held free and clear
of all Encumbrances other  than Encumbrances imposed in connection with the
credit  agreements identified in Schedule 5.3, in the name of Apple  or its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date. 

  



  

  6.19 __Restrictions on Solicitation and  Hiring_._ Notwithstanding any
other provision  of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, and
except  as Parent and the Surviving Corporation may otherwise agree in 
writing, Parent will not (and will cause its controlled  Affiliates not to),
for a period of four years from the date of  this Agreement, hire, or enter
into any form of consulting  arrangement or agreement with, any Person who is
an officer or  manager of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time  and who is in a category identified on _Schedule 6.19_  (the "officers
or managers"), and Parent will not and  will cause its controlled Affiliates
not to, solicit (other than  by means of general advertisement not directed
to Persons who  are officers or managers of the Surviving Corporation as of
the  Effective Time) or otherwise induce any such Persons who are  executive
officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the  Effective Time, to enter
into any type of employment or  consulting arrangement or agreement that
would be prohibited by  this Section 6.19. Parent acknowledges that (i)
this  provision is reasonable, (ii) Apple and Hampton would not  enter into
this Agreement without Parent agreeing to and  complying with this Section
6.19, (iii) the Surviving  Corporation would suffer irreparable harm upon
Parents  violation of this provision and (iv) among other remedies,  the
Surviving Corporation will be entitled to obtain a temporary  restraining
order  and/or  injunction upon Parents breach of this provision. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  6.20 __Repayment of Apple  Indebtedness_._ Hampton will repay or cause
to  be repaid all of Apples outstanding Indebtedness described  on
_Schedule 6.20_ at the Effective Time. 

  



  

  6.21 __Employee  Matters_._ Hampton will or will cause the  Surviving
Corporation to honor and pay or provide the benefits  required under the

this Agreement may  be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether  before or after the Apple Shareholder Approval: 

  



  

  (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and Apple; 

  



  

  (b) by Apple (provided that Apple is not then in material  breach of any
covenant or in breach of any representation or  warranty or other agreement
contained herein), if (i) there  has been a breach by Parent or Hampton of
any of their  respective representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements  contained in this Agreement or any such representation and 
warranty has become untrue, in either case such that  Section 7.2(a), Section
7.2(b) or Section 7.2(d)  would be incapable of being satisfied, and such
breach or  condition either by its terms cannot be cured or if reasonably 
capable of being cured has not been cured within 30 calendar  days following
receipt by Parent of notice of such breach or  (ii) the condition contained
in Section 7.1(g) will be  incapable of being satisfied; 

  



  

  (c) by Parent (provided that neither Parent nor Hampton is  then in
material breach of any covenant, or in breach of any,  representation or
warranty or other agreement contained herein),  if (i) there has been a
breach by Apple of any of its  representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained  in this Agreement, or any such representation and
warranty has  become untrue, in either case such that Section 7.3(a), 
Section 7.3(b) or Section 7.3(d) would be incapable of  being satisfied, and
such breach or condition either by its  terms cannot be cured or if
reasonably capable of being cured  has not been cured within 30 calendar days
following receipt by  Apple of notice of such breach or (ii) the condition 
contained in Section 7.1 (g) will be incapable of  being satisfied; 

  



  

  (d) by either Parent or Apple if any Order preventing or  prohibiting
consummation of the Transactions has become final  and nonappealable; 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  (e) by either Parent or Apple if the Merger shall not have  occurred prior
to March 31, 2007, unless the failure of the  Merger to have occurred by such
date is due to the failure of  the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or  observe in all material respects the covenants and agreements
of  such party set forth herein; 

  



  

  (f) by either Parent or Apple if the Apple Shareholder  Approval is not
obtained at the Apple Shareholders Meeting ; 

  



  

  (g) by Parent if the board of directors of Apple shall have  modified or
withdrawn the Apple Board Recommendation or failed  to confirm the Apple
Board Recommendation within four Business  Days after Parents request to do
so (it being understood,  however, that for all purposes of this Agreement,
and without  limitation, the fact that Apple, in compliance with this 
Agreement, has supplied any Person with information regarding  Apple or has
entered into discussions or negotiations with such  Person as permitted by
this Agreement, or the disclosure of such  facts, shall not be deemed a
withdrawal or modification of the  Apple Board Recommendation); or 

  



  

  (h) by Apple, if the board of directors of Apple authorizes  Apple,
subject to complying with the terms of this Agreement, to  enter into a
written agreement with respect to an Apple Superior  Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) Apple  shall have complied with the provisions of
Section 6.12,  (ii) Apple shall have given Parent and Hampton at least  four
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to  terminate this
Agreement, attaching a description of all  material terms and conditions of
such Apple Superior Proposal,  (iii) during such four Business Day period,
Apple engages  in good faith negotiations with Parent and Hampton with
respect  to such changes as Parent and Hampton may propose to the terms  of
the Merger and this Agreement, (iv) Parent and Hampton  do not make prior to
such termination of this Agreement, a  definitive, binding offer which the
Board of Directors of Apple  determines in good faith, after consultation
with its legal and  financial advisors, is at least as favorable to Apple 
Shareholders as such Apple Superior Proposal and (v) prior  to such
termination pursuant to this Section 8.1(h), Apple  pays to Parent in
immediately available funds, the fee required  to be paid pursuant to Section
8.3. Apple agrees to notify  Parent and Hampton promptly if its intention to
enter into a  written agreement referred to in its notification given
pursuant  to this Section 8.1(h) shall change at any time after  giving such
notification. 

  



  

  8.2 __Effect of  Termination_._ In the event of termination of  this
Agreement by either Parent or Apple pursuant to  Section 8.1, this Agreement
will forthwith become void and  there will be no liability under this
Agreement on the part of  Parent, Hampton or Apple, except (i) to the extent
that  such termination results from the willful and material breach by  a
party of any of its representations, warranties or covenants  in this
Agreement and (ii) as provided in Section 8.3;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
the provisions of  Sections 6.5, 6.16, 8.3, 9.5 and this Section 8.2 will 
each remain in full force and effect and will survive any  termination of
this Agreement. 

  



  

  8.3 __Fees and Expenses_._  

  



  

  (a) Notwithstanding Section 6.16, if this Agreement is  terminated by (i)
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or  Section 8.1(f) and prior to the time of
such termination an  Apple Competing Transaction has been communicated to the
Apple  board of directors and not withdrawn, and within nine months  Apple
enters into an agreement to complete or completes Apple  Competing
Transaction, (ii) Parent pursuant to  Section 8.1(g), or (iii) Apple pursuant
to 8.1(h),  then Apple will pay to Parent a termination fee equal to  $4.0
million plus up to $2.0 million of reasonable  documented, third party, 
out-of-pocket  Expenses (the " _Termination Fee_ "). 

  



  

  (b) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements  contained in
this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the  Transactions and that, without
these agreements, the other party  would not enter into this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements.  In the event that Apple fails to pay the amounts due
pursuant to  Section 8.1(h) and this Section 8.3 when due, and, in  order to
obtain such payment, the non-breaching party commences  a suit that results
in a judgment against the breaching party  for the amounts set forth in this
Section 8.3, the  breaching party will pay to the non-breaching party
interest on  the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3, commencing on  the
date that such amounts become due, at a rate equal to the  rate of interest
publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., from time  to time, in The City of New
York, as such banks base rate  plus 2.00%. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

   IX. MISCELLANEOUS

  9.2 __Amendment and  Modification_._ Subject to applicable Law, this 
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements may be amended, modified,  or
supplemented only by the written agreement of the parties  hereto or thereto
in any and all respects before the Effective  Time; provided, however, that

amendment that by Law  requires further approval by the Apple Shareholders

  9.3 __Waiver of  Compliance_._ Except as otherwise provided in  this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the failure by any  Person to comply
with any obligation, covenant, agreement or  condition under such agreements
may be waived by the Person  entitled to the benefit thereof only by a
written instrument  signed by the Person granting such waiver, but such
waiver or  failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, 
covenant, agreement or condition will not operate as a waiver  of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other  failure. The failure of
any Person to enforce at any time any of  the provisions of such agreements
will in no way be construed to  be a waiver of any such provision, nor in any
way to affect the  validity of such agreements or any part thereof or the
right of  any Person thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. 
No waiver of any breach of such provisions will be held to be a  waiver of
any other or subsequent breach.

respect hereof brought by  another party hereto or its successors or
permitted assigns may  be brought and determined in any federal or state
court located  in the State of Delaware, and each of Apple, Parent and
Hampton  hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Action or 
proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally  and
unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the  aforesaid courts. Each
of Apple, Parent and Hampton hereby  irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion,  as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Action with  respect to this Agreement, the Transactions, any provision 
hereof or the breach, performance, enforcement, validity or  invalidity
hereof, (a) any claim that it is not personally  subject to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts for any  reason other than the failure to lawfully
serve process,  (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from 
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process  commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice,  attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of  judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (c) to  the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws,
that  (i) Action in any such court is brought in an inconvenient  forum,

hereunder, including its failure to  take all actions as are necessary on its
part 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  to the consummation of the Transactions, will cause irreparable  injury to
the other parties for which damages, even if  available, will not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each  party hereby consents to the issuance of
injunctive relief by  any court of competent jurisdiction to compel
performance of  such partys obligations and to the granting by any court 
of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations  hereunder.

the instruments referred  to in this Agreement) and the Ancillary Agreements
(other than  the Transition Services Agreement), together with the

prior agreements and understandings, both written  and oral, among the

Products under this  Agreement. Hampton may revise the LPAG from time to time
in its  discretion. 

  



  

  1.5 The Prior Agreement is hereby terminated as of the  Effective Date and

  5.2 As to the payment of Royalty, time is of the essence  and KCI shall
make each of said payments on time. Any payment  delayed for any reason
whatsoever shall bear interest from the  date when payment is due, until the
date when paid in full at  the annual rate of one percentage point (1%) over

shall pay said tax or  charge and deduct same from the payment of Royalty to
Hampton.  KCI shall secure an official receipt for said deducted tax or 
charge and (if required by Hampton) provide a copy of same to  Hampton. 

  



  

  7. __Quality Standards and Control__  

  



  

  7.1 KCI agrees that the Licensed Products shall be of high  quality and of
such style, appearance, and distinctiveness as  will preserve and protect the
prestige of the Licensed Marks and  the goodwill represented and symbolized
thereby; that such  Licensed Products will be manufactured, packaged,
marketed,  advertised, promoted, distributed and sold in accordance with 
applicable laws and the directions which may be communicated by  Hampton from
time to time under this Agreement; and that KCI  shall not deviate from the
quality, standards and manufacturing  specifications of the Licensed Products
unless it obtains prior  written consent from Hampton. As stated above, the
LPAG shall  govern the approval and regulation of the quality of the 
Licensed Products under this Agreement. Further, KCI agrees to  market,
advertise and promote the Licensed Products using such  high standards that
will preserve and protect the prestige of  the Licensed Marks. 

  



  

  7.2 Hampton shall have the right to approve, in its sole  discretion, any
Licensed Products which KCI proposes to use or  be associated with any of the
Licensed Marks. To enable Hampton  to consider such approval, KCI shall
submit to Hampton, at no  cost to Hampton, all information, articles and
documents  reasonably necessary to consider such approval including, 
without limitation, engineering drawings, prototypes, samples,  raw
materials, testing procedures, marketing concepts, designs,  graphics,
manufacturing/quality control records and other such  information as
reasonably requested by Hampton (collectively,  the "Product Information").
Hampton shall review such  Product Information and respond to KCI within
twenty  (20) business days of receipt of the last of the applicable  Product
Information from KCI. If Hampton should disapprove of  any proposed Licensed
Product, it shall promptly provide  specific reasons for such disapproval in
writing to KCI.  Hamptons failure to respond to KCI within twenty  (20)
business days of receipt of the last of the applicable  Product Information
from KCI shall constitute non-approval;  provided, however, that if KCI does
not receive a response to  its request for approval of submitted materials
within twenty  (20) business days of Hamptons receipt of the last of  the
applicable Product Information, 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  KCI must notify Hampton in writing that it has not had a  response from
Hampton. Hampton shall then have an additional ten  (10) business days from
the date of such notice to respond  to the submitted Product Information. If
Hampton fails to  respond after notice and within such ten (10) additional 
business days, the materials shall be deemed approved. Once  Hampton has
approved the proposed Licensed Product, KCI shall  not materially depart
therefrom without Hamptons prior  written consent, which shall not
unreasonably be withheld. 

  



  

  7.3 Unless otherwise agreed to by Hampton in writing, KCI  shall submit
the foregoing Product Information to Hampton for  its prior written approval
prior to any use of the Licensed  Marks or initiation of Licensed Product
manufacture or assembly.  Once Hamptons approval is obtained as provided
in  Section 7.2 above, such approval shall be deemed continuous  with
respect to the Licensed Product(s) so approved unless there  has been a
material change or alteration in the Licensed  Products or materials
submitted to Hampton. 

  



  

  7.4 Upon ten (10) business days prior written  notice to KCI, and at
Hamptons expense and election,  Hampton shall have the right to inspect the
Licensed Products at  KCIs business  and/or at  each and every point of
manufacture no more than twice a year. 

  



  

  8. __Advertising and Promotion__  

  



  

  8.1 All advertisements, marketing and promotional  materials, labels and
all other written materials pertaining to  the Licensed Products shall bear
the Licensed Marks in  prominence as prescribed by Hampton. Furthermore, the
Licensed  Marks shall be used by KCI only on and in connection with those 
Licensed Products that have been approved by Hampton in  accordance with
Section 7.2. KCI shall cause no other  products of KCI to bear the Licensed
Marks except with the  express prior written consent of Hampton. 

  



  

  8.2 Unless Hampton shall have previously consented in  writing, KCI shall
not use any of the Licensed Marks with any  other trademark, word, symbol,
logo, design, business name or  trade name. KCI shall not use the names
"Hamilton  Beach," "Proctor-Silex," or "Hamilton  Beach/Proctor-Silex" in
connection with KCIs  corporate business, trade name or domain names. 

  



  

  8.3 No less than thirty (30) business days in advance  of any use
contemplated herein, KCI shall provide Hampton with  samples of
advertisements, marketing and promotional materials,  labels, and any other
written materials bearing the Licensed  Marks (hereinafter the "Materials")
for Hamptons  approval in accordance with the procedure described in 
Section 7.2 above. KCI shall consult with Hampton regarding  KCIs brand
strategies with respect to the Licensed  Products on which the Licensed Marks
will be used. 

  



  

  8.4 KCI agrees that it shall cause to appear on all  Materials on or in
connection with which the Licensed Marks are  used, the following legends: 

  



  

  "Hamilton  Beach®  is a registered trademark of Hamilton Beach/Proctor-
Silex, Inc.  used under license," and/or 

  



  

  "Proctor-Silex®  is a registered trademark of Hamilton Beach/Proctor-
Silex, Inc.  used under license," 

  



  

  or such other statement as may be requested, from time to time,  by
Hampton. 

  



  

  8.5 KCI shall ensure that the Materials shall be of such  standard,
quality, style and appearance as shall, in the sole  judgment of Hampton, be
adequate and suited to exploit the  Licensed Marks and their goodwill to
maximum advantage,  protection and enhancement. In the event that Hampton
shall  determine that any Materials are not of an adequate standard, 
quality, style or appearance, Hampton shall so notify KCI in  writing, which
writing will describe the inadequacy with  specificity and KCI shall take the
necessary action to correct  the inadequacy as specified by Hampton and said
Materials shall  not be used until Hampton, in its sole discretion,
determines  that said Materials are now of adequate standard, quality,
style  and appearance. 

  



  

  8.6 If Hampton determines, in its sole discretion, that the  manner in
which the Licensed Marks, the Materials  and/or the  Licensed Products are
being used do not comply with  Hamptons standards, Hampton shall notify KCI
thereof in  writing, which writing shall set forth the non-compliance with 
specificity, and such shall not be used until KCI remedies the  same in
accordance with Hamptons instructions and until  Hampton, in its sole
discretion, determines that such are in  reasonable compliance with its
standards. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  8.7 Should Hampton notify KCI that the manner in which the  Licensed
Marks, the Materials  and/or the  Licensed Products are used by KCI are not
in compliance with the  requirements set forth in this Agreement, and should
KCI  continue to use such Licensed Marks, Materials  and/or  Licensed
Products without adjusting the same in accordance with  the requirements set
forth in this Agreement, such noncompliance  will be considered a material
breach of this Agreement and cause  for termination pursuant to Section
12.3(i). 

  



  

  9. __Trademark Infringement__  

  



  

  9.1 KCI shall give written notice to Hampton upon KCI  becoming aware of
any imitation or infringement of the Licensed  Marks or of any assertion that
the use of the Licensed Marks  infringes the rights of a third party. 

  



  

  9.2 Hampton, at its sole cost and expense and in its own  name, and at its
sole discretion, may prosecute any action or  proceeding which it deems
necessary or desirable to protect the  Licensed Marks including, but not
limited to, actions or  proceedings to prevent or deter misappropriation,
counterfeiting  or infringement thereof  and/or to  defend against a claim
of infringement thereof. KCI shall fully  cooperate with Hampton in such
efforts arising out of the use of  the Licensed Marks as permitted by this
Agreement. KCI shall  consent to being named a party to such action if
requested by  Hampton with all costs of KCIs participation in any such 
action being borne by Hampton. 

  



  

  9.3 KCI shall not commence any actions or proceedings  alleging
infringement of the Licensed Marks without the prior  written consent of
Hampton. 

  



  

  9.4 Any and all damages recovered in any action or  proceeding commenced
by Hampton which relate to a claim of  misappropriation, counterfeiting or
infringement shall belong  solely and exclusively to Hampton, except to such
extent as may  otherwise be agreed between KCI and Hampton in a separate 
written agreement. 

  



  

  10. __Maintenance of Trademarks__  

  



  

  Hampton shall be responsible for the maintenance of the Licensed  Marks.
KCI shall cooperate and assist Hampton in maintaining the  Licensed Marks but
Hampton shall be solely responsible for all  costs in preparing, recording
and maintaining the registrations  of the Licensed Marks. 

  



  

  11. __Indemnification and Insurance__  

  



  

  11.1 KCI shall release, indemnify, defend, and hold  harmless Hampton and
its Affiliates, and each of their officers,  directors, stockholders, agents
and employees, from and against  any losses, claims, demands, actions,
regulatory proceedings,  suits, injunctions, liabilities, causes of action,
duties or  obligations, acts or omissions, reporting or notification 
obligations, corrective actions, recalls, damages, judgments,  costs,
expenses, penalties and fines, reasonable attorneys  fees and investigation
costs (collectively "Loss")  arising out of any (i) breach by KCI of its
obligations,  representations and warranties herein; (ii) unauthorized  use
by KCI of the Licensed Marks; (iii) alleged damage or  injury, including
death, to persons or property, allegedly  caused by or sustained in
connection with the Licensed Products;  and (iv) alleged defect, potential
safety issue, prohibited  act or violation of law, regulation, voluntary or
mandatory  standard, or guidance with respect to the design, manufacture, 
workmanship and materials, labeling, warnings and instructions,  packaging,
marketing, promotion, advertising, distribution or  sale of the Licensed
Products by or on behalf of KCI, provided  that Hampton shall give reasonably
prompt notice, cooperation  and assistance, other than financial assistance,
to KCI relative  to any claim or suit, and further provided that, KCI shall
have  the option to undertake the conduct and defense of any suit so 
brought with counsel reasonably acceptable to Hampton. KCI shall  provide the
indemnity, defense and other obligations imposed by  this Section whether or
not any such Loss is claimed to have  arisen, in whole or in part, out of
negligence or any other  grounds of legal liability, including without
limitation,  violation of any duty imposed by law or regulation. 

  



  

  11.2 Hampton shall release, indemnify, defend, and hold  harmless KCI and
its Affiliates, and each of their officers,  directors, stockholders, agents

(ii) claim of trademark infringement asserted against KCI  by third parties
relating to KCIs use of the Licensed  Marks on the Licensed Products in the
Territory as permitted  hereunder during the Term as authorized by this
Agreement;  provided that KCI shall give reasonably prompt notice, 
cooperation and assistance, other than financial assistance, to  Hampton
relative to any claim or suit, and provided that  KCIs liability for any
Loss is not covered by any  insurance policy then in effect on behalf of KCI
or any recovery  thereunder is less than the amount of KCIs liability for 
the Loss. It is further agreed that, so long as 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Hampton agrees in writing to indemnify KCI pursuant to this  Section
11.2(ii), Hampton shall have the option to  undertake the conduct and defense
of any suit so brought with  counsel reasonably acceptable to KCI. 

  



  

  11.3. During the Term of this Agreement, KCI shall obtain  and maintain at
its own expense, from a qualified insurance  company having an A.M. Best A

products  liability coverage, with coverage of not less than  $2,000,000 per
occurrence and $2,000,000 general aggregate  for death, bodily injury and
property damage. The policy may  contain a deductible or self-insured
retention that is normal  and customary for a business of similar type and
size not to  exceed $100,000 per occurrence. KCI shall be fully and solely 
responsible for paying that deductible or self-insured  retention. KCIs
liability under this Agreement shall not  be limited by the amount of such
insurance coverage, and such  insurance shall be primary and not contributory
as to other  insurance Hampton may have in effect. The above-required
policy  shall be written on an "occurrence" basis unless the  policy is
available only on a "claims-made" basis, in  which case the terms of such
"claims-made" insurance  coverage shall be acceptable to Hampton and with
terms and  conditions that are reasonably available from the insurance 
market, and the coverage shall be maintained in effect for a  period of five
(5) years after the termination of this  Agreement. Such policy shall name
Hampton as an additional  insured to the extent of KCIs obligations under
the terms  and conditions of this Agreement. Such policy shall provide 
coverage for and protection against any and all Loss arising out  of the
design, manufacture, workmanship and materials, labeling  warnings and
instructions, packaging, advertising, promotion,  marketing, distribution,
sale or use of the Licensed Products,  including without limitation, any
alleged defects or failure of  the Licensed Products  and/or any  alleged
damage or injury, including death to persons or  property, allegedly caused
by or sustained in connection with  the Licensed Products. KCI shall provide
thirty (30) days  prior written notice to Hampton of the cancellation or 
substantial modification to any such policy. KCI shall deliver  to Hampton
certificates of insurance evidencing the existence of  such insurance
coverage promptly after its issuance.

inventory of Materials  during the Sell-Off Period as prescribed in Section
13  below. 

  



  

  12.7 Failure of either party to exercise any right or  option to terminate

Subsidiaries, as applicable, during the two-year period ending  on the date
hereof. 

  



  

  1.7 __Standard of Performance; Standard of  Care_._ Each of Parent and
Hampton will  perform, or will cause to be performed, the Transition

   II. CONSIDERATION 

  



  

  2.1 __Fees_._ (a) In  consideration for the Transition Services provided

Period, Hampton agrees to pay Parent the monthly fees (the  " _Fees_ ") set
forth in _Schedule A_  attached hereto. Other than the Fees and the expenses
specified  in Section 2.2, neither Hampton nor any of its Subsidiaries  will

Subsidiaries in connection with its or their  provision of the Transition
Services hereunder. 

  



  

  (b) In consideration for the Transition Services provided  by or on behalf
of Hampton under this Agreement during the  Transition Period, Parent agrees
to pay or cause KCI to pay to  Hampton the Fees set forth _Schedule B_
attached  hereto. Other than the Fees and the expenses specified in  Section
2.2, none of Parent, KCI or any of their  Subsidiaries will be responsible
for any fees or expenses  incurred by Hampton or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection  with its or their provision of the Transition Services
hereunder. 

  



  

  (c) For any period during the Transition Period in which a  Transition
Service is not rendered for the entire period  specified, the Fees described
in _Schedule A_ or  _Schedule B_, as the case may be, with respect to such 
Transition Service will be prorated based on the actual number  of days in
such period, if applicable. 

  



  

  2.2 __Out-of-Pocket   Expenses_._ All (a) reasonable, documented  out-of-
pocket  expenses (including travel expenses) that arise directly out of  the

Expenses_") and (b) sales or similar non-income  taxes incurred by any of the
parties or their Subsidiaries in  connection with the provision of Transition

accrue on the amount payable at a rate  equal to the rate of interest
publicly announced by Citibank,  N.A., from time to time, in The City of New
York, as such  banks base rate (the " _Citibank Base  Rate_ ") plus 2.50%
per month, compounded monthly;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
failure to pay  is due to a good faith dispute, any amounts ultimately 
determined to be payable by the disputing party will instead  include
interest compounded at a rate equal to the Citibank Base  Rate plus 2.00% per
month. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

   III. TERMINATION 

  



  

  3.1 __Term and  Termination_._ (a) This Agreement will  remain in effect

  (d) Authorized officers of Parent and Hampton may terminate  this
Agreement by mutual written agreement. 

  



  

  (e) The parties obligations pursuant to  Sections 1.8, 2.3 and 4.2 will
survive the expiration or  any termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms. 

  



  

   IV. MISCELLANEOUS 

  



  

  4.1 __Warranty  Disclaimer_._ EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN  SECTION 1.7, NONE OF
THE PARTIES MAKES ANY WARRANTY  CONCERNING THE TRANSITION SERVICES AND THE
WARRANTY IN SUCH  SECTION 1.7 IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS
OR  IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER  THIS
AGREEMENT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW HAMPTON, PARENT  AND/OR KCI TO
SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION, MANAGE OR OPERATE ITS  BUSINESS. 

  



  

  4.2 __Indemnification_._ (a) Subject  to subsection (d) below, each party
(the  " _Indemnitor_ ") will indemnify and hold the other  party, its
subsidiaries and each of their respective  shareholders, officers, directors,
employees, agents and  representatives and each of the successors and assigns
of any of  the foregoing (each, an " _Indemnitee_ ") harmless  from and
against and will promptly defend the Indemnitees from  and reimburse the
Indemnitees for any and all losses, damages,  costs, expenses, liabilities,
obligations and claims of any kind  (including reasonable attorneys fees and
other costs and  expenses) (collectively, " _Damages_ "), arising  out of or
related to (i) a breach by the Indemnitor of this  Agreement and (ii) the
gross negligence, bad faith or  intentional misconduct of the Indemnitor in
connection with the  provision or receipt of Transition Services under this
Agreement. 

  



  

  (b) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is  provided under
this Section 4.2 will be computed net of any  insurance proceeds actually
received by the Indemnitee pursuant  to an insurance policy with respect to
such Damages. 

  



  

  (c) The Indemnitee must notify the Indemnitor in writing of  any claim,
demand, action or proceeding for which  indemnification will be sought under
Section 4.2(a),  provided, however, that the failure to so notify shall not 
adversely impact the Indemnitees right to indemnification  hereunder except
to the extent that such failure to notify  actually prejudices or prevents
the Indemnitors ability to  defend such claim, demand, action or proceeding.
If such claim,  demand, action or proceeding is a third party claim,
demand,  action or proceeding, the Indemnitor will have the right at its 
expense to assume the defense thereof using counsel reasonably  acceptable to
the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee will have the right  (i) to participate, at
its own expense, with respect to any  such third party claim, demand, action
or proceeding that is  being defended by the Indemnitor, and (ii) to assume
the  defense of such third party claim, demand, action or proceeding,  at
the cost and expense of the Indemnitor if the Indemnitor  fails or ceases to
defend the same. In connection with any such  third party claim, demand,
action or proceeding, the parties  will cooperate with each other and provide
each other with  access to relevant books and records in their possession. If
a  firm written offer is made to the Indemnitor to settle any such  third
party claim, demand, action or proceeding solely 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  in exchange for monetary sums to be paid by the Indemnitor (and  such
settlement contains a complete release of the Indemnitee  and its
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers  and employees) and the
Indemnitor proposes to accept such  settlement and the Indemnitee refuses to
consent to such  settlement, then (i) the Indemnitor will be excused from, 
and the Indemnitee will be solely responsible for, all further  defense of
such third party claim, demand, action or proceeding,  (ii) the maximum
liability of the Indemnitor relating to  such third party claim, demand,
action or proceeding will be the  amount of the proposed settlement if the
amount thereafter  recovered from the Indemnitee on such third party claim,
demand,  action or proceeding is greater than the amount of the proposed 
settlement, and (iii) the Indemnitee will pay all  reasonable attorneys fees
and legal costs and expenses  incurred after rejection of such settlement by
the Indemnitee;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the amount thereafter 
recovered by such third party from the Indemnitee is less than  the amount of
the proposed settlement, the Indemnitee will be  reimbursed by the Indemnitor
for such attorneys fees and  legal costs and expenses up to a maximum amount
equal to the  difference between the amount recovered by such third party
and  the amount of the proposed settlement. 

  



  

  (d) No party will be entitled to recover any consequential,  indirect or
punitive damages (including lost profits or lost  revenues) arising out of
the matters covered by this Agreement,  regardless of the form of the claim
or action, including claims  or actions for indemnification, tort, breach of
contract,  warranty, representation or covenant. 

  



  

  (e) The Indemnitees rights to indemnification as set  forth in this
Section 4.2 will be their exclusive remedy  with respect to any Damages
arising out of the matters covered  by this Agreement other than to terminate
this Agreement as set  forth in Section 3.1(b). Each Indemnitee hereto will
be  entitled to indemnification for Damages sustained in accordance  with
the provisions of this Section 4.2 regardless of any  Law or public policy
that would limit or impair the right of the  party to recover indemnification
under the circumstances. 

  



  

  4.3 __Relationship of  Parties_._ Each of Hampton, Parent and their 
respective Subsidiaries will for all purposes be deemed to be an  independent
contractor with respect to the provision of  Transition Services hereunder,
will not be considered (nor will  any of their directors, officers,
employees, contractors or  agents be considered) an agent, employee,
commercial  representative, partner, franchisee or joint venturer of any 
other party and will have no duties or obligations beyond those  expressly
provided in this Agreement and the Ancillary  Agreements with respect to the
provision of Transition Services.  No party will have any authority, absent
express written  permission from the other party, to enter into any
agreement,  assume or create any obligations or liabilities, or make 
representations on behalf of any other party. The provision of  the
Transition Services shall not alter the classification of,  or the
compensation and employee benefits provided to, the  Parent Employees or the
Hampton Employees. The Parent Employees  shall be employed solely by Parent
or its Subsidiaries, and the  Hampton Employees shall be employed solely by
Hampton or its  Subsidiaries. Neither the Parent Employees nor the Hampton 
Employees shall be entitled to any additional compensation for  the provision
of the Transition Services. 

  



  

  4.4 __Interpretation_._ (a) When  a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections or Schedules,  such reference will be to a Section of or Schedule to
this  Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in  this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not  affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this  Agreement. Whenever the words "include," 
"includes" or "including" are used in this  Agreement, they will be deemed to
be followed by the words  "without limitation." Unless the context
otherwise  requires, (i) "or" is disjunctive but not  necessarily exclusive,
(ii) words in the singular include  the plural and vice versa, (iii) the use
in this Agreement  of a pronoun in reference to a party hereto includes the 
masculine, feminine or neuter, as the context may require, and  (iv) terms
used herein which are defined in GAAP have the  meanings ascribed to them
therein. All Schedules hereto will be  deemed part of this Agreement and
included in any reference to  this Agreement. This Agreement will not be
interpreted or  construed to require any party to take any action, or fail
to  take any action, if to do so would violate any applicable Law. 

  



  

  (b) All parties have participated in negotiating and  drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a  question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement will  be construed as if drafted
jointly by all parties, and no  presumption or burden of proof will arise
favoring or  disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any 
provision of this Agreement. 

  



  

  4.5 __Amendment_._ This  Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented only by the  written agreement of the parties hereto. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  4.6 __Waiver of  Compliance_._ Except as otherwise provided in  this
Agreement, the failure by any party to comply with any  obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition under this  Agreement may be waived by the party
entitled to the benefit  thereof only by a written instrument signed by the
party  granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon 
strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or  condition
will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with  respect to, any subsequent
or other failure. The failure of any  party to enforce at any time any of the
provisions of this  Agreement will in no way be construed to be a waiver of
any such  provision, or in any way to affect the validity of this  Agreement
or any part hereof or the right of any party hereafter  to enforce each and
every such provision. No waiver of any  breach of such provisions will be
held to be a waiver of any  other or subsequent breach. 

  



  

  4.7 __Notices_._ All notices  required or permitted pursuant to this
Agreement must be given  as set forth in the Merger Agreement. All notices
directed to  KCI will be delivered to Parent as set forth in the Merger 
Agreement on behalf of KCI. 

  



  

  4.8 __Third Party  Beneficiaries_._ Except as otherwise provided  in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or  implied, is intended to
confer on any person or entity other  than the parties hereto or their
respective successors and  assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under  or by reason of this Agreement. 

  



  

  4.9 __Successors and  Assigns_._ This Agreement will be binding upon  and
will inure to the benefit of the signatories hereto and  their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No party may  assign this Agreement, or any
of its rights or liabilities  hereunder, without the prior written consent of
the other party  hereto, and any attempt to make any such assignment without
such  consent will be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that KCI may
assign its rights and liabilities under this  Agreement to Parent without
Hamptons written consent. Any  such assignment will not relieve the party
making the assignment  from any liability under this Agreement. 

  



  

  4.10 __Severability_._ The  illegality or partial illegality of any or all
of this  Agreement, or any provision hereof, will not affect the validity 
of the remainder of this Agreement, or any provision hereof, and  the
illegality or partial illegality of this Agreement will not  affect the
validity of this Agreement in any jurisdiction in  which such determination
of illegality or partial illegality has  not been made, except in either case
to the extent such  illegality or partial illegality causes this Agreement to
no  longer contain all of the material provisions reasonably  expected by
the parties to be contained herein. 

  



  

  4.11 __Governing Law_._ This  Agreement will be governed by and construed
in accordance with  the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable
to  contracts made and wholly performed within such state, without  regard
to any applicable conflict of Laws principles. 

  



  

  4.12 __Submission to Jurisdiction;  Waivers_._ Each party irrevocably
agrees that  any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, 
the transactions contemplated hereby, any provision hereof, the  breach,
performance, validity or invalidity hereof or for  recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof  brought by another party
hereto or its successors or permitted  assigns may be brought and determined
in any federal or state  court located in the State of Delaware, and each
party hereby  irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding  for itself and in respect to its property, generally and 
unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid  courts. Each
party hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to  assert, by way of motion,
as a defense, counterclaim or  otherwise, in any action or proceeding with
respect to this  Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, any
provision  hereof or the breach, performance, enforcement, validity or 
invalidity hereof, (a) any claim that it is not personally  subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any  reason other than the failure
to lawfully serve process,  (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from  jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process  commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice,  attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of  judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise), and (c) to  the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws,
that  (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is  brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such  suit, action or proceeding is
improper, or (iii) this  Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in  or by such courts. 

  



  

  4.13 __Force Majeure_._ None of  the parties will be liable to any other
party for failure to  perform or delays in performing any part of the
Transition  Services if such failure or delay results from an act of God, 
war, terrorism, revolt, revolution, sabotage, actions of a  Governmental
Entity, Laws, regulations, embargo, fire, strike,  other labor 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  trouble or any other cause or circumstance beyond the control of  such
party other than financial difficulties of the other party.  Upon the
occurrence of any such event which results in, or will  result in, delay or
failure to perform according to the terms of  this Agreement, each party will
promptly give notice to the  other parties of such occurrence and the
effect  and/or  anticipated effect of such occurrence. All parties will
use  their reasonable efforts to minimize disruptions in its  performance,
to resume performance of its obligations under this  Agreement as soon as
practicable and to assist the other parties  in obtaining, at their sole
expense, an alternative source for  the affected Transition Services and the

estate or gift tax purposes  (hereinafter called a "Charitable
Organization"), and  for the benefit of no other person, provided that such
trust may  grant a general or special power of appointment to such  Class B
Holder or such Class B Holders spouse  and may permit trust assets to be
used to pay taxes, legacies  and other obligations of the trust or the estate
of such  Class B Holder or such Class B Holders spouse  payable by reason
of the death of such Class B Holder or  such Class B Holders spouse, (E) a

such a corporation), or any  partnership interest in such a partnership (or
any survivor of a  merger or consolidation of such a partnership), is
acquired by  any person who is not within such class of persons, all shares 
of Class B Common Stock then held by such corporation or  partnership, as the
case may be, shall be deemed without further  act on anyones part to be
converted into shares of  Class A Common Stock, and stock certificates
formerly  representing such shares of Class B Common Stock shall  thereupon
and thereafter be deemed to represent the like number  of shares of Class A
Common Stock, and (G) any natural  person with respect to whom such Class B
Holder would be a  Permitted Transferee if such person desired to transfer
shares  of Class B Common Stock to such Class B Holder.

Stock in question as trustee  pursuant to a trust other than a trust

  (iii) In the case of a Class B Holder holding the  shares of Class B
Common Stock in question as trustee  pursuant to a trust which was
irrevocable on the record date of  the Spin Off (hereinafter in this

stockholder of such corporation and  (C) the Class B Holder who or that

pledgee pursuant to a  bona fide pledge of such shares as collateral security
for  indebtedness due to the pledgee, provided that such shares shall  not
be transferred to or registered in the name of the pledgee  and shall remain
subject to the provisions of this  paragraph 4\. In the event of foreclosure
or other similar  action by the pledgee, such pledged shares of Class B 
Common Stock may only be transferred to a Permitted Transferee  of the
pledgor or converted into shares of Class A Common  Stock, as the pledgee may
elect. 

  



  

  (c) For purposes of this paragraph 4:

legal entities. 

  



  

  (d) Any purported transfer of shares of Class B Common  Stock not
permitted hereunder shall be void and of no effect and  the purported
transferee shall have no rights as stockholder of  the Corporation and no
other right against or with respect to  the Corporation. The Corporation may,
as a condition to the  transfer or the registration of transfer of shares
of  Class B Common Stock to a purported Permitted Transferee,  require the
furnishing of such affidavits or other proof as it  deems necessary to
establish that such transferee is a Permitted  Transferee. The Corporation
may note on the certificates for  shares of Class B Common Stock the
restrictions on transfer  and registration of transfer imposed by this
paragraph 4. 

  



  

  5. (a) Each share of Class B Common Stock may at  any time be converted
into one fully paid and nonassessable  share of Class A Common Stock. Such
right shall be  exercised by the surrender of the certificate representing
such  share of Class B Common Stock to be converted to the  Corporation at
any time during normal business hours at the  principal executive offices of
the Corporation, or if an agent  for the registration of transfer of shares
of Class B  Common Stock is then duly appointed and acting (said agent
being  hereinafter called the "Transfer Agent") then at the  office of the
Transfer Agent, accompanied by a written notice of  the election by the
holder thereof to convert and (if so  required by the Corporation or the
Transfer Agent) by  instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation  and to the Transfer Agent, duly executed by such holder or his 
duly authorized attorney, and transfer tax stamps or funds  therefor, if
required pursuant to  subparagraph (e) below. 

  



  

  (b) As promptly as practicable after the surrender for  conversion of a
certificate representing shares of Class B  Common Stock in the manner
provided in  subparagraph (a) above and the payment in cash of any  amount
required by the provisions of  subparagraphs (a) and (e), the Corporation
will  deliver or cause to be delivered to the office of the Transfer  Agent
upon the written order of the holder of such certificate,  a certificate or
certificates representing the number of full  shares of Class A Common Stock
issuable upon such  conversion, issued in such name or names as such holder
may  direct. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made  immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of the  surrender of the
certificate representing shares of Class B  Common Stock, and all rights of
the holder of such shares as  such holder shall cease at such time and the
person or persons  in whose name or names the certificate or certificates 
representing the shares of Class A Common Stock are to be  issued shall be 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  treated for all purposes as having become the record holder or  holders of
such shares of Class A Common Stock at such  time; provided, however, that
any such surrender and payment on  any date when the stock transfer books of
the Corporation shall  be closed shall constitute the person or persons in
whose name  or names the certificate or certificates representing shares of 
Class A Common Stock are to be issued as the record holder or  holders
thereof for all purposes immediately prior to the close  of business on the
next succeeding day on which such stock  transfer books are open. 

  



  

  (c) No adjustments in respect of dividends shall be made  upon the
conversion of any share of Class B Common Stock,  provided, however, that if
a share shall be converted subsequent  to the record date for the payment of
a dividend or other  distribution on shares of Class B Common Stock but prior
to  such payment, the registered holder of such share at the close  of
business on such record date shall be entitled to receive the  dividend or
other distribution payable on such share on such  date notwithstanding the
conversion thereof or the  Corporations default in payment of the dividend
due on  such date. 

  



  

  (d) The Corporation covenants that it will at all times  reserve and keep
available, solely for the purpose of issue upon  conversion of the
outstanding shares of Class B Common  Stock, such number of shares of Class A
Common Stock as  shall be issuable upon the conversion of all such
outstanding  shares, provided, that nothing contained herein shall be 
construed to preclude the Corporation from satisfying its  obligations in
respect of the conversion of the outstanding  shares of Class B Common Stock
by delivery of purchased  shares of Class A Common Stock which are held in
the  treasury of the Corporation. The Corporation covenants that if  any
shares of Class A Common Stock, required to be reserved  for purposes of
conversion hereunder, require registration with  or approval of any
governmental authority under any federal or  state law before such shares of
Class A Common Stock may be  issued upon conversion, the Corporation will use
its best  efforts to cause such shares to be duly registered or approved, 
as the case may be. The Corporation will use its best efforts to  list the
shares of Class A Common Stock required to be  delivered upon conversion
prior to such delivery upon each  national securities exchange upon which the
outstanding  Class A Common Stock is listed at the time of such  delivery.
The Corporation covenants that all shares of  Class A Common Stock will, upon
issue, be fully paid and  nonassessable and not subject to any preemptive
rights. 

  



  

  (e) The issuance of certificates for shares of Class A  Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Class B Common  Stock shall be made without charge
for any stamp or other  similar tax in respect of such issuance. However, if
any such  certificate is to be issued in a name other than that of the 
holder of the share or shares of Class B Common Stock  converted, the person
or persons requesting the issuance thereof  shall pay to the Corporation the
amount of any tax which may be  payable in respect of any transfer involved
in such issuance or  shall establish to the satisfaction of the Corporation
that such  tax has been paid. 

  



  

  6. Each share of Class A Common Stock and Class B  Common Stock shall be
equal in respect of rights to dividends  and other distributions in cash,
stock or property of the  Corporation, provided that in the case of dividends
or other  distributions payable in stock of the Corporation, including 
distributions pursuant to stock split-ups or divisions of stock  of the
Corporation, which occur after the date of the Spin Off,  only shares of
Class A Common Stock shall be distributed  with respect to Class A Common
Stock and only shares of  Class B Common Stock shall be distributed with
respect to  Class B Common Stock. 

  



  

  7. In case of any consolidation, merger or sale of all or  substantially
all of the assets of the Corporation as a result  of which stockholders of
the Corporation shall be entitled to  receive cash, stock other securities or
other property with  respect to or in exchange for their stock of the
Corporation,  each holder of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common  Stock
shall be entitled to receive an equal amount of  consideration for each share
of Class A Common Stock or  Class B Common Stock held by such holder. 

  



  

  8. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 6 of this  Article IV,
Section 3, and except as otherwise  approved by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of  the outstanding Voting Stock (as defined below),
the Corporation  shall not issue additional shares of Class B Common Stock 
after the date of the Spin Off and all shares of Class B  Common Stock
surrendered for conversion or otherwise acquired by  the Corporation shall be
retired. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  9. The number of authorized shares of any class or classes  of stock of
the Corporation may be increased or decreased (but  not below the number of
shares thereof then outstanding) by the  affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding  stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
thereon. 

  



  

  10. (a) No stockholder of the Corporation shall be  entitled as of right
to subscribe for, purchase or receive any  part of any new or additional
issue of stock of any class,  whether now or hereafter authorized, or of
bonds, debentures or  other securities convertible into or exchangeable for
stock, but  all such additional shares of stock of any class, or bonds, 
debentures or other securities convertible into or exchangeable  for stock,
may be issued and disposed of by the Board of  Directors on such terms and
for such consideration, so far as  may be permitted by law, and to such
persons, as the Board of  Directors in its absolute discretion may deem
advisable. 

  



  

  (b) Authority is hereby expressly granted to the Board of  Directors from
time to time to issue any authorized but unissued  shares of Class A Common
Stock for such consideration (but  not less than par value) and on such terms
as it may determine. 

  



  

  11. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the person  in whose name
any share of its stock is registered as the owner  thereof for all purposes,
and shall not be bound to recognize  any equitable or other claims to, or
interest in, such share on  the part of any other person, whether or not the
Corporation  shall have notice thereof, except as expressly provided by 
applicable law. 

  



  

   ARTICLE V   

  



  

  Section 1. __Number,  Election and Terms of Directors_._ Subject to  the
rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred  Stock to elect
additional Directors under circumstances  specified in a Preferred Stock
Designation, the number of the  Directors of the Corporation will not be less
than  [ ]  nor more than  [ ]  and will be fixed from time to time in the
manner provided in  the Bylaws of the Corporation. The Directors, other than
those  who may be elected by the holders of any series of Preferred  Stock,
will be classified with respect to the time for which  they severally hold
office into three classes, as nearly equal  in number as possible, designated
Class I, Class II  and Class III. At any meeting of stockholders at which 
Directors are to be elected, the number of Directors elected may  not exceed
the greatest number of Directors then in office in  any class of Directors.
The Directors first appointed to  Class I will hold office for a term
expiring at the annual  meeting of stockholders to be held in 2007; the
Directors first  appointed to Class II will hold office for a term expiring 
at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2008; and  the Directors
first appointed to Class III will hold office  for a term expiring at the
annual meeting of stockholders to be  held in 2009. At each succeeding annual
meeting of the  stockholders of the Corporation, the successors to the class
of  Directors whose term expires at that meeting will be elected by 
plurality vote of all votes cast at such meeting to hold office  for a term
expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held  in the third year
following the year of their election, with the  members of each class to hold
office until their successors are  elected and qualified. Subject to the
rights, if any, of the  holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect
additional  Directors under circumstances specified in a Preferred Stock 
Designation, Directors may be elected by the stockholders only  at an annual
meeting of stockholders. 

  



  

  Section 2. __Nomination  of Director Candidates_._ Advance notice of 
stockholder nominations for the election of Directors must be  given in the
manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation. 

  



  

  Section 3. __Removal_._ Subject  to the rights, if any, of the holders of
any series of Preferred  Stock to elect additional Directors under
circumstances  specified in a Preferred Stock Designation, any Director may
be  removed from office by the stockholders only for cause and only  in the
manner provided in this Article V, Section 3.  At any annual meeting or
special meeting of the stockholders,  the notice of which states that the
removal of a Director or  Directors is among the purposes of the meeting, the
affirmative  vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the 
outstanding Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, may  remove such
Director or Directors for cause. 

  



  

  Section 4. __Amendment,  Repeal, Etc_._ Notwithstanding anything 
contained in this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary,  the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the  outstanding voting
power of the outstanding Voting Stock, voting  together as a single class, is
required to amend or repeal, or  adopt any provision 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  inconsistent with, this Article V. The amendment or repeal  of, or the
adoption of any provision inconsistent with, this  Article V must be made by
written ballot. 

  



  

   ARTICLE VI   

  



  

  The Board of Directors may make, amend and repeal the Bylaws of  the
Corporation. Any Bylaw made by the Board of Directors under  the powers
conferred hereby may be amended or repealed by the  Board of Directors
(except as specified in any such Bylaw so  made or amended) or by the
stockholders in the manner provided  in the Bylaws of the Corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing  and anything contained in this Certificate of
Incorporation or  the Bylaws to the contrary, Article I, Sections 1, 3  and
8, Article II, Sections 1, 2 and 3 and  Article VII of the Bylaws may not be
amended or repealed by  the stockholders, and no provision inconsistent
therewith may be  adopted by the stockholders, without the affirmative vote
of the  holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the outstanding 
Voting Stock, voting together as a single class. The Corporation  may in its
Bylaws confer powers upon the Board of Directors in  addition to the
foregoing and in addition to the powers and  authorities expressly conferred
upon the Board of Directors by  applicable law. For the purposes of this
Certificate of  Incorporation, "Voting Stock" means stock of the 
Corporation of any class or series entitled to vote generally in  the
election of Directors. Notwithstanding anything contained in  this
Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the  affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 80% of the voting  power of the outstanding Voting Stock,
voting together as a  single class, is required to amend or repeal, or to
adopt any  provision inconsistent with, this Article VI. 

  



  

   ARTICLE VII   

  



  

  Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred  Stock: 

  



  

  (a) any action required or permitted to be taken by the  stockholders of
the Corporation must be effected at a duly  called annual or special meeting
of stockholders of the  Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in
writing of  such stockholders; and 

  



  

  (b) special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may  be called
only by (i) the Chairman of the Board of  Directors, the Chief Executive
Officer or the President of the  Corporation, or (ii) the Secretary of the
Corporation  within ten calendar days after the Secretary receives the 
written request of a majority of the total number of Directors  then in
office. 

  



  

  At any annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders of the 
Corporation, only such business will be conducted or considered  as has been
brought before such meeting in the manner provided  in the Bylaws of the
Corporation. Notwithstanding anything  contained in this Certificate of
Incorporation to the contrary,  the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least 80% of the  voting power of the outstanding Voting Stock, voting
together as  a single class, will be required to amend or repeal, or adopt 
any provision inconsistent with, this Article VII. 

  



  

   ARTICLE VIII   

  



  

  To the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law  of the
State of Delaware or any other applicable laws as  presently or hereafter in
effect, no member of the Board of  Directors shall be personally liable to
the Corporation or its  stockholders for or with respect to any acts or
omissions in the  performance of his or her duties as a member of the Board
of  Directors. No amendment to or repeal of this Article VIII  shall apply
to or have any effect on the liability or alleged  liability of any member of
the Board of Directors for or with  respect to any acts or omissions of such
member occurring prior  to such amendment or repeal. 

  



  

   ARTICLE IX   

  



  

  Section 1. __Right  to Indemnification_._ The Corporation shall 
indemnify to the fullest extent permitted or required by the  General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware any current or  former director,
officer or employee of the Corporation who is  made, or threatened to be
made, a party to or is otherwise  involved in an action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil,  criminal, administrative, investigative or other (including
an  action, suit or 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation) (collectively,  a
_"proceeding"_ ), by reason of the fact  that such person is or was a
director or officer of the  Corporation or an administrator or fiduciary with
respect to any  employee benefit plan of the Corporation, or serves or served
at  the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee  or
agent, or as an administrator or fiduciary of an employee  benefit plan, of
another corporation, partnership, joint  venture, trust or other enterprise
(an  _"indemnitee"_ ) against all expense,  liability and loss (including
attorneys fees, judgments,  fines, Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 (or  comparable  non-U.S. law)  excise taxes or penalties and
amounts paid in settlement)  reasonably incurred or suffered by such
indemnitee in connection  therewith; provided, however, that the Corporation
shall  indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding  (or
part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such  proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board of  Directors. No amendment to this
Article IX that limits the  Corporations obligation to indemnify any person
shall have  any effect on such obligation for any act or omission that 
occurs prior to the later of the effective date of the amendment  or the date
notice of the amendment is given to the person. 

  



  

  Section 2. __Right  to Advancement of Expenses_._ Any  indemnification
made pursuant to Section 1 of this  Article IX shall include the right to be
paid by the  Corporation the expenses (including, without limitation, 
attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in defending any  such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition (an  _"advancement of expenses"_ ); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if the General  Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware so requires, an  advancement of expenses incurred by an
indemnitee in his or her  capacity as a director, officer or employee (and
not in any  other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such 
indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an  employee benefit
plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the  Corporation of an undertaking
(an  _"undertaking"_ ), by or on behalf of such  indemnitee, to repay all
amounts so advanced if it shall  ultimately be determined by final judicial
decision from which  there is no further right to appeal (a _"final 
adjudication"_ ) that such indemnitee is not entitled  to be indemnified for
such expenses under this Section 2 or  otherwise. The rights to
indemnification and to the advancement  of expenses conferred in Sections 1
and 2 of this  Article IX shall be contract rights and such rights shall 
continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director,  officer,
employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the  indemnitees heirs,
executors and administrators. 

  



  

  Section 3. __Indemnification  of Employees and Agents of the 
Corporation_._ The Corporation may, to the  extent authorized from time to
time by the Board of Directors,  grant rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of  expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation or an 
administrator or fiduciary with respect to any employee benefit  plan to the
fullest extent of the provisions of this  Article IX with respect to the
indemnification and  advancement of expenses of directors and officers of
the  Corporation. 

  



  

  Section 4. __Non-Exclusivity  of Rights_._ Any indemnification or
advancement  of expenses made pursuant to this Article IX shall not be 
exclusive of any other right that any person may have or  hereafter acquire
under any statute, this Certificate of  Incorporation, the Bylaws or any
agreement, vote of stockholders  or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

  



  

  Section 5. __Insurance_._ The  Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect  itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
the  Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture,  trust
or other enterprise against any expense, liability or  loss, whether or not
the Corporation would have the power to  indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss  under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.

   ARTICLE I   

  



  

  MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS 

  



  

  Section 1. __Time  and Place of Meetings_._ All meetings of the 
stockholders for the election of directors or for any other  purpose will be
held at such time and place, within or without  the State of Delaware, as may
be designated by the Board of  Directors of the Corporation (the  _"Board"_
) or, in the absence of a  designation by the Board, the Chairman of the
Board (the  _"Chairman"_ ), the Chief Executive  Officer, the President or
the Secretary, and stated in the  notice of meeting. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Board may,  in its sole discretion, determine that meetings of
the  stockholders will not be held at any place, but may instead be  held by
means of remote communications, subject to such  guidelines and procedures as
the Board may adopt from time to  time. The Board may postpone and reschedule
any previously  scheduled annual or special meeting of the stockholders. 

  



  

  Section 2. __Annual  Meetings_._ Annual meetings of stockholders  will be
held at such date and time as may be designated from  time to time by the
Board, at which meeting the stockholders  will elect by a plurality of the
votes cast by written ballot  the directors to succeed those directors whose
terms expire at  such meeting and will transact such other business as may 
properly be brought before the meeting in accordance with  Article I, Section
8. 

  



  

  Section 3. __Special  Meetings_._ Special meetings of the  stockholders
may be called only by (i) the Chairman, the  Chief Executive Officer or the
President or (ii) the  Secretary within ten calendar days after the Secretary
receives  the written request of a majority of the total number of 
directors then in office. Any such request by a majority of the  total number
of directors then in office must be sent to the  Chairman and the Secretary
and must state the purpose or  purposes of the proposed meeting. Special
meetings of holders of  the outstanding preferred stock of the Corporation
(the  _"Preferred Stock"_ ), if any, may be  called in the manner and for
the purpose or purposes provided in  the applicable Preferred Stock
Designation (as defined in the  Corporations Certificate of Incorporation,
as amended (the  _"Certificate of Incorporation"_ )). 

  



  

  Section 4. __Notice  of Meetings_._ Written notice of every meeting  of
the stockholders, stating the place, if any, date and time  thereof, the
means of remote communications, if any, by which  stockholders and proxy
holders may be deemed to be present in  person and vote at such meeting, and,
in the case of a special  meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is  called, will be given not less than ten nor more than 60 
calendar days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder  of record
entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise  provided herein, by
the Certificate of Incorporation or by law.  When a meeting is adjourned to
another place, date or time,  written notice need not be given of the
adjourned meeting if the  place, if any, date and time thereof, and the means
of remote  communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders 
may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned  meeting are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is  taken; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the adjournment  is for more than 30 calendar days, or if
after the adjournment a  new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting,
written  notice of the place, if any, date and time thereof, and the  means
of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders  and proxy holders
may be deemed to be present in person and vote  at such adjourned meeting
must be given in conformity herewith.  At any adjourned meeting, any business
may be transacted that  properly could have been transacted at the original
meeting. 

  



  

  Section 5. __Inspectors_._ The  Board may appoint one or more inspectors
of election, who may be  employees of the Corporation, to act as judges of
the voting and  to determine those entitled to vote at any meeting of the 
stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, in advance of such  meeting. The
Board may designate one or more persons as  alternate inspectors to replace
any inspector who fails to act.  If no inspector or alternate is able to act
at a meeting of  stockholders, the presiding officer of the meeting may
appoint  one or more substitute inspectors. 

   ##### 

  

  

  Section 6. __Quorum_._ The  holders of a majority of the outstanding
voting power of all  classes of stock entitled to vote thereat, present in
person or  represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at all meetings 
of the stockholders for the transaction of business thereat  except as
otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate of  Incorporation or in a
Preferred Stock Designation. If, however,  such quorum is not present or
represented at any meeting of the  stockholders, the presiding officer or
holders of a majority of  the outstanding voting power of all classes of
stock entitled to  vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy,
will  have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without 
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is  present or
represented. 

  



  

  Section 7. __Voting;  Proxies_._ Except as otherwise provided by law,  by
the Certificate of Incorporation or in a Preferred Stock  Designation, each
stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of  stockholders will be entitled
at every meeting of the  stockholders to one vote for each share of stock
having voting  power standing in the name of such stockholder on the books
of  the Corporation on the record date for the meeting and such  votes may
be cast either in person or by proxy. Every proxy must  be authorized in a
manner permitted by Section 212 of the  General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (or any  successor provision). Without affecting any vote
previously  taken, a stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not 
irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by  delivering a
revocation of proxy or a new proxy bearing a later  date to the Secretary of
the Corporation. The vote upon any  question brought before a meeting of the
stockholders may be by  voice vote, unless otherwise required by the
Certificate of  Incorporation or these Bylaws or unless the Chairman or the 
holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of all  classes of
stock entitled to vote thereon, present in person or  represented by proxy at
such meeting, otherwise determine. Every  vote taken by written ballot will
be counted by the inspectors  of election. When a quorum is present at any
meeting, the  affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding  voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon, 
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and  which has
actually been voted, will be the act of the  stockholders, except in the
election of directors or as  otherwise provided in these Bylaws, the
Certificate of  Incorporation, a Preferred Stock Designation or by law. 

  



  

  Section 8. __Order  of Business_._ 

  



  

  (a) The Chairman, or such other officer of the Corporation  designated by
a majority of the total number of directors then  in office, will call
meetings of the stockholders to order and  will act as presiding officer
thereof. Unless otherwise  determined by the Board prior to the meeting, the
presiding  officer of the meeting of the stockholders will also determine 
the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for  each matter
upon which the stockholders will vote at the meeting  and the order of
business and have the authority in his or her  sole discretion to regulate
the conduct of any such meeting,  including, without limitation, by imposing
restrictions on the  persons (other than stockholders of the Corporation or
their  duly appointed proxies) that may attend any such  stockholders
meeting, by ascertaining whether any  stockholder or such stockholders proxy
may be excluded  from any meeting of the stockholders based upon any 
determination by the presiding officer, in the presiding  officers sole
discretion, that any such person has  disrupted or is likely to disrupt the
proceedings thereat, and  by determining the circumstances in which any
person may make a  statement or ask questions at any meeting of the
stockholders.  Unless and to the extent determined by the Board or the 
presiding officer of the meeting, meetings of stockholders will  not be
required to be held in accordance with the rules of  parliamentary
procedure. 

  



  

  (b) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such  business will be
conducted or considered as is properly brought  before the annual meeting. To
be properly brought before an  annual meeting, business must be (i) specified
in the  notice of the annual meeting (or any supplement thereto) given  by
or at the direction of the Board in accordance with  Article I, Section 4,
(ii) otherwise properly  brought before the annual meeting by or at the

of the  total number of directors then in office, or  (iii) otherwise

of the Corporation in accordance  with Article I, Section 8(c). 

  



  

  (c) For business to be properly requested by a stockholder  to be brought
before an annual meeting, (i) the stockholder  must be a stockholder of the
Corporation of record at the time  of the giving of the notice for such
annual meeting provided for  in these Bylaws, (ii) the stockholder must be
entitled to  vote at such meeting, (iii) the stockholder must have given 
timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary and  (iv) if the
stockholder, or the beneficial owner on whose  behalf any business is brought
before the meeting, has provided  the Corporation with a 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Proposal Solicitation Notice, as that term is defined in  this Section
8(c), such stockholder or beneficial owner  must have delivered a proxy
statement and form of proxy to the  holders of at least the percentage of
shares of the outstanding  Voting Stock (as defined in the Certificate of
Incorporation)  that is required to approve such business that the
stockholder  proposes to bring before the annual meeting and included in
such  materials the Proposal Solicitation Notice. To be timely, a 
stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and  received at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation  not less than 60 nor more
than 90 calendar days prior to the  first anniversary of the date on which
the Corporation first  mailed its proxy materials for the preceding years
annual  meeting of stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that  if the date
of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30  calendar days prior to or
delayed by more than 30 calendar days  after the anniversary of the preceding
years annual  meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so 
delivered or received, as the case may be, not later than the  close of
business on the later of the 90th calendar day  prior to such annual meeting
or the tenth calendar day following  the day on which public disclosure of
the date of such meeting  is first made. In no event shall the public
disclosure of an  adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period
for  the giving of a stockholders notice as described above. A 
stockholders notice to the Secretary must set forth as to  each matter the
stockholder proposes to bring before the annual  meeting (A) a description in
reasonable detail of the  business desired to be brought before the annual
meeting and the  reasons for conducting such business at the annual
meeting,  (B) the name and address, as they appear on the  Corporations
books, of the stockholder proposing such  business and the beneficial owner,
if different, on whose behalf  the proposal is made, (C) the class and series
and number  of shares of capital stock of the Corporation that are owned 
beneficially and of record by the stockholder proposing such  business and by
the beneficial owner, if different, on whose  behalf the proposal is made,
(D) a description of all  arrangements or understandings among such
stockholder and any  other person or persons (including their names) in
connection  with the proposal of such business by such stockholder and any 
material interest of such stockholder in such business,  (E) whether either
such stockholder or beneficial owner  intends to deliver a proxy statement
and form of proxy to  holders of at least the percentage of shares of the
outstanding  Voting Stock that is required to approve the proposal (an 
affirmative statement of such intent, a  _"Proposal Solicitation Notice"_)
and  (F) a representation that such stockholder intends to  appear in person
or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such  business before the annual
meeting. Notwithstanding the  foregoing provisions of this Section 8(c), a
stockholder  must also comply with all applicable requirements of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations  thereunder
(the _"Exchange Act"_ ) with  respect to the matters set forth in this
Section 8(c). For  purposes of this Section 8(c) and Article II,  Section 3,
_"public disclosure"_   means disclosure in a press release reported by the
Dow Jones  News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news 
service or in a document filed by the Corporation with the  Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act  or furnished by the
Corporation to stockholders. Nothing in this  Section 8(c) will be deemed to
affect any rights of  stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the 
Corporations proxy statement pursuant to  Rule 14a-8  under the Exchange
Act. 

  



  

  (d) At a special meeting of stockholders, only such  business may be
conducted or considered as is properly brought  before the meeting. To be
properly brought before a special  meeting, business must be (i) specified in
the notice of  the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the 
direction of the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the  President or a
majority of the total number of directors then in  office in accordance with
Article I, Section 3 or  (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting
by the  presiding officer or by or at the direction of a majority of the 
total number of directors then in office. 

  



  

  (e) The determination of whether any business sought to be  brought before
any annual or special meeting of the stockholders  is properly brought before
such meeting in accordance with this  Section 8 will be made by the presiding
officer of such  meeting. If the presiding officer determines that any
business  is not properly brought before such meeting, he or she will so 
declare to the meeting and any such business will not be  conducted or
considered. 

  



  

  Section 9. __Definition_._ Every  reference in these Bylaws to a majority
or other proportion of  stock shall refer to such majority or other
proportion of the  votes of shares of all classes of such stock.

   ARTICLE II 
   

  



  

   DIRECTORS   

  



  

  Section 1. __Number  and Term of Office_._ Subject to the rights, if 
any, of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional  directors under
circumstances specified in a Preferred Stock  Designation, and to the minimum
and maximum number of authorized  directors provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation, the  authorized number of directors may be determined from
time to  time only (i) by a vote of a majority of the total number  of
directors then in office or (ii) by the affirmative vote  of the holders of
at least 80% of the outstanding voting power  of the outstanding Voting
Stock, voting together as a single  class. The directors, other than those
who may be elected by the  holders of any series of the Preferred Stock, will
be classified  with respect to the time for which they severally hold office
in  accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation. Directors need  not be
stockholders. 

  



  

  Section 2. __Vacancies  and New Directorships_._ Subject to the rights, 
if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect  additional
directors under circumstances specified in a  Preferred Stock Designation,
newly created directorships  resulting from any increase in the number of
directors and any  vacancies on the Board resulting from death,
resignation,  disqualification, removal or other cause will be filled
solely  by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors 
then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board, or  by a sole
remaining director. Any director elected in accordance  with the preceding
sentence will hold office for the remainder  of the full term of the class of
directors in which the new  directorship was created or the vacancy occurred
and until such  directors successor is duly elected and qualified, subject 
to such directors earlier death, resignation,  disqualification or removal.
No decrease in the number of  directors constituting the Board will shorten
the term of an  incumbent director. 

  



  

  Section 3. __Nominations  of Directors; Election_._ (a) Subject to  the
rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred  Stock to elect
additional directors under circumstances  specified in a Preferred Stock
Designation, only persons who are  nominated in accordance with this Section
3 of  Article II will be eligible for election as directors of  the
Corporation at a meeting of stockholders. 

  



  

  (b) Nominations of persons for election as directors of the  Corporation
may be made only at an annual meeting of  stockholders (i) by or at the
direction of the Board or a  committee thereof or (ii) by any stockholder
that is a  stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided 
for in this Section 3 of Article II, who is entitled  to vote for the
election of directors at such annual meeting,  and who complies with the
procedures set forth in this  Section 3 of Article II. If a stockholder, or
a  beneficial owner on whose behalf any such nomination is made,  has
provided the Corporation with a Nomination Solicitation  Notice, as that term
is defined in this Section 3 of  Article II below, such stockholder or
beneficial owner must  have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to
the  holders of at least the percentage of shares of the outstanding  Voting
Stock that is required to approve such nomination and  included in such
materials the Nomination Solicitation Notice.  All nominations by
stockholders must be made pursuant to timely  notice in proper written form
to the Secretary. 

  



  

  (c) To be timely, a stockholders notice must be  delivered to or mailed
and received at the principal executive  offices of the Corporation not less
than 60 nor more than 90  calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the
date on  which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the 
preceding years annual meeting of stockholders; provided,  however, that if
the date of the annual meeting is advanced more  than 30 calendar days prior
to or delayed by more than 30  calendar days after the anniversary of the
preceding years  annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must
be  so delivered not later than the close of business on the later  of the
90th calendar day prior to such annual meeting or  the tenth calendar day
following the day on which public  disclosure of the date of such meeting is
first made. If the  Corporation did not hold an annual meeting the previous
year,  then the deadline is a reasonable time before the Corporation  begins
to print and mail its proxy materials. In no event shall  the public
disclosure of an adjournment of an annual meeting  commence a new time period
for the giving of a  stockholders notice as described above. To be in
proper  written form, such stockholders notice must set forth or  include
the following: (i) the name and address, as they  appear on the Corporations
books, of the stockholder  giving the notice and of the beneficial owner, if
any, on whose  behalf the nomination is made; (ii) a representation that 
the stockholder giving the notice is a holder of record of stock  of the
Corporation entitled to vote at such annual meeting and  intends to appear in
person or by proxy at the annual meeting to  nominate the person or persons
specified in the notice;  (iii) the class and number of shares of stock of
the  Corporation owned beneficially and of record by the 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  stockholder giving the notice and by the beneficial owner, if  any, on
whose behalf the nomination is made; (iv) a  description of all arrangements
or understandings between or  among any of (A) the stockholder giving the
notice,  (B) the beneficial owner on whose behalf the notice is  given, (C)
each nominee, and (D) any other person or  persons (naming such person or
persons) pursuant to which the  nomination or nominations are to be made by
the stockholder  giving the notice; (v) such other information regarding 
each nominee proposed by the stockholder giving the notice as  would be
required to be included in a proxy statement filed  pursuant to the proxy
rules of the Securities and Exchange  Commission had the nominee been
nominated, or intended to be  nominated, by the Board; (vi) the signed
consent of each  nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation if so
elected;  (vii) whether either such stockholder or beneficial owner  intends
to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to  holders of at least the
percentage of shares of the outstanding  Voting Stock that is required to
elect such nominee or nominees  (an affirmative statement of such intent, a 
_"Nomination Solicitation Notice"_ ); and  (viii) a representation that such
stockholder intends to  appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to
nominate the  persons named in the notice. At the request of the Board, any 
person nominated by the Board for election as a director must  furnish to the
Secretary that information required to be set  forth in a stockholders
notice of nomination that pertains  to the nominee. The presiding officer of
any annual meeting  will, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination
was not  made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by this  Section
3 of Article II, and if he or she should so  determine, he or she will so
declare to the meeting and the  defective nomination will be disregarded.
Notwithstanding the  foregoing provisions of this Section 3 of Article II, 
a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements  of the
Exchange Act with respect to the matters set forth in  this Section 3 of
Article II. 

  



  

  Section 4. __Powers_._ The  business and affairs of the Corporation will
be managed by or  under the direction of the Board, which may exercise all
such  powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things  as
are not by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by  these Bylaws
directed or required to be exercised or done by the  stockholders. 

  



  

  Section 5. __Resignation_._ Any  director may resign at any time by giving
notice in writing or  by electronic transmission of his or her resignation to
the  Chairman or the Secretary. Any resignation will be effective  upon
actual receipt by any such person or, if later, as of the  date and time
specified in such written notice. The acceptance  of a resignation will not
be necessary to make any such  resignation effective, unless expressly so
provided in the  resignation. 

  



  

  Section 6. __Regular  Meetings_._ Regular meetings of the Board may  be
held without notice immediately after the annual meeting of  the stockholders
and at such other time and at such place as may  from time to time be
determined by the Board. 

  



  

  Section 7. __Special  Meetings_._ Special meetings of the Board may  be
called by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or the  President on one
calendar days notice to each director by  whom it is not waived, given
either personally or by telephone  or by any means set forth in Section 1 of
Article III;  special meetings will be called by the Chairman, Chief
Executive  Officer, President or Secretary in like manner and on like 
notice on the written request of a majority of the total number  of directors
then in office. Special meetings of the Board may  be held at such time and
place either within or without the  State of Delaware as is determined by the
Board or specified in  the notice of any such meeting. 

  



  

  Section 8. __Quorum_._ At  all meetings of the Board, a majority of the
total number of  directors then in office, or if the total number of
directors  then in office is an even number one-half thereof, will 
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Except for  the
designation of committees as hereinafter provided and except  for actions
required by these Bylaws, by the Certificate of  Incorporation or by law to
be taken by a majority of the total  number of directors then in office, the
act of a majority of the  directors present at any meeting at which there is
a quorum will  be the act of the Board. If a quorum is not present at any 
meeting of the Board, the directors present thereat may adjourn  the meeting
from time to time to another place, time, or date,  without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a  quorum is present. 

  



  

  Section 9. __Written  Action_._ Any action required or permitted to  be
taken at any meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof  may be taken
without a meeting, if all members of the Board or  of such committee, as the
case may be, consent thereto in  writing or electronic transmission, and such
writing or writings  or electronic transmission are filed with the minutes

  Section 10. __Participation  in Meetings by  Remote Communications_._
Members of the  Board or any committee designated by the Board may
participate  in a meeting of the Board or any such committee, as the case
may  be, by means of telephone conference or other similar  communications
equipment by means of which all persons  participating in the meeting can
hear each other, and such  participation in a meeting will constitute
presence in person at  the meeting, except where a person participates in the
meeting  for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any 
business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called  or
convened. 

  



  

  Section 11. __Committees_._ The  Board may, by resolution passed by a
majority of the total  number of directors then in office, designate one or
more  committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the  directors
of the Corporation and each to have such lawfully  delegable powers and
duties as the Board may confer. The Board  may designate one or more
directors as alternate members of any  committee, who may replace any absent
or disqualified member at  any meeting of the committee. In lieu of such
designation by the  Board, in the absence or disqualification of any member
of a  committee of the Board, the members thereof present at any such 
meeting of such committee and not disqualified from voting,  whether or not
they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint  another member of the
Board to act at the meeting in the place  of any such absent or disqualified
member. Except as otherwise  provided by law, any such committee, to the
extent provided in  the resolution of the Board, will have and may exercise
all the  powers and authority of the Board in the management of the 
business and affairs of the Corporation, and may, if  appropriate, authorize
the seal of the Corporation to be affixed  to all papers which may require
it. Such committee or committees  shall have such name or names and such
limitations of authority  as may be determined from time to time by
resolution adopted by  the Board. 

  



  

  Section 12. __Conduct  of Business_._ Unless otherwise ordered by the 
Board, a majority of the members of any committee appointed by  the Board
pursuant to these Bylaws shall constitute a quorum for  the transaction of
business at any meeting thereof, and the act  of a majority of the members
present at a meeting at which a  quorum is present will be the act of such
committee. Any such  committee may prescribe its own rules for calling and
holding  meetings and its method of procedure, subject to any rules 
prescribed by the Board, and will keep a written record of all  actions taken
by it. 

  



  

  Section 13. __Compensation_._ The  Board may establish the compensation
for, and reimbursement of  the expenses of, directors for membership on the
Board and on  committees of the Board, attendance at meetings of the Board
or  committees of the Board, and for other services by directors to  the
Corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries.

   NOTICES   

  



  

  Section 1. __Generally_._ Except  as otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation  or these Bylaws, whenever notice is required to
be given to any  director or stockholder, it will not be construed to
require  personal notice, but such notice may be given in writing by mail 
or by courier service, addressed to such director or  stockholder, at the
address of such director or stockholder as  it appears on the records of the
Corporation, with postage  thereon prepaid, and such notice will be deemed to
be given at  the time when the same is deposited in the United States mail
or  dispatched with a courier service. Notice to directors may also  be
given personally, by telephone or by electronic transmission  or similar
medium of communication or as otherwise may be  permitted by law or these
Bylaws. 

  



  

  Section 2. __Waivers_._ Whenever  any notice is required to be given by
law or under the  provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws,  a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons 
entitled to such notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission  by the
person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before  or after the time
of the event for which notice is to be given,  will be deemed equivalent to
such notice. Attendance of a person  at a meeting will constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting,  except when the person attends a meeting for the
express purpose  of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the 
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully  called or
convened. Unless required by the Certificate of  Incorporation, neither the
business to be transacted at, nor the  purpose of, any regular or special
meeting of the stockholders,  directors or members of a committee of
directors need be  specified in any written waiver of notice.

Chairman or the Secretary. Any such  resignation will be effective upon
actual receipt by any such  person or, if later, as of the date and time
specified in such  notice. The acceptance of such resignation will not be
necessary  to make any such resignation effective, unless expressly so

company, trust or unincorporated  organization in which the Corporation may

and relative participating, optional, or other  special rights of the various

  Section 3. __Transfer_._ Upon  surrender to the Corporation or the
transfer agent of the  Corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed
or  accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or  authority

transfer agent to, issue a new certificate to  the person entitled thereto,
cancel the old certificate and  record the transaction upon the Corporations
books. 

  



  

  Section 4. __Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_._ The  Secretary
may direct a new certificate or certificates or  uncertificated shares to be
issued in place of any certificate  or certificates theretofore issued by the
Corporation alleged to  have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an  affidavit of that fact, satisfactory to the Secretary, by the  person
claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or  destroyed. As a
condition precedent to the issuance of a new  certificate or certificates or
uncertificated shares, the  Secretary may require the owners of such lost,
stolen or  destroyed certificate or certificates, or such owners  legal
representative, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum  and with such

thereof, the Board may fix a  record date, which will not precede the date
upon which the  resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board,
and  which will not be more than 60 nor less than ten calendar days  before
the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by  the Board, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled  to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders will be at  the close of business on the calendar
day next preceding the day  on which notice is given, or, if notice is
waived, at the close  of business on the calendar day next preceding the day
on which  the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record 
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the  stockholders will apply
to any adjournment of the meeting;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board
may fix a new  record date for the adjourned meeting. 

  



  

  (b) In order that the Corporation may determine the  stockholders entitled
to receive payment of any dividend or  other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the  stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any  change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of  any
other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which  record date will
not precede the date upon which the resolution  fixing the record date is
adopted and will not be more than 60  calendar days prior to such action. If
no record date is fixed,  the record date for determining stockholders for
any such  purpose will be at the close of business on the calendar day on 
which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. 

  



  

  (c) The Corporation will be entitled to treat the person in  whose name
any share of its stock is registered as the owner  thereof for all purposes,

interest in, such share on the  part of any other person, whether or not the
Corporation has  notice thereof, except as expressly provided by applicable
law.
