the current tax year is not established by the Closing Date, the prorations
shall be made on the basis of the rate or assessed value in effect for the
preceding tax year and shall be adjusted when the exact amounts are
determined. All such prorations shall be based upon the most recent available
assessed value available prior to the Closing Date.

timely payment of all taxes due with respect to the period covered by such tax
return. The Partnership shall determine the amount of tax due that is not

Entity or its assets or operations (including under any Permits assigned to
the Partnership or its Affiliates hereunder); and (c) charges for water,
sewer, telephone, electricity, natural gas and other utilities serving any
assets or operations of the Subject Entities. If any such amounts are not
known at Closing, then such proration shall be made based on VTDC's good faith
estimate, with a true-up payment to be made from VTDC to the Partnership, or
vice-versa, as promptly as practicable after exact amounts are determined.

5.5 Absence of Litigation. There is no Claim pending or, to the knowledge of
the Partnership, threatened against the Partnership or its Affiliates relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents
or which, if adversely determined, would reasonably be expected to materially

agreements under this Agreement or the Partnership Ancillary Documents to
which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

5.6 Brokers and Finders. No investment banker, broker, finder, financial

ARTICLE VI 
COVENANTS

6.1 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Omnibus Agreement, each of the
Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to do, or cause to be
taken all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under Applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If at any time after the Closing
Date any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, the Parties and their duly authorized representatives shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take all such action.

6.2 Further Assurances. After the Closing, each Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take such further actions, including
obtaining or transferring to the other Party all necessary Permits, Consents,
orders and Contracts, and executing and causing its Affiliates to execute such
further documents, as may be necessary or reasonably requested by the other
Party in order to effectuate the intent of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents and to provide such other Party with the intended benefits of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that the Parties have used their good faith
efforts to identify all of the assets and operations to be assigned,
transferred, contributed and conveyed to the Partnership in connection with
this Agreement. However, due to the age of some of the assets or operations
and the difficulties in locating appropriate data with respect to some of the
assets included in these operations, it is possible that some of the assets
intended to be assigned, transferred, contributed or conveyed ultimately to
the Partnership were not identified and therefore are not assigned,
transferred, contributed or conveyed (directly or indirectly) to the
Partnership as of the Effective Time. To the extent that any assets were not
identified but form an integral part of the assets and operations of the Subject Entities and are not needed for the
conduct of any of the businesses conducted by Valero and its Affiliates, then
the intent of the Parties is that all such unidentified assets are intended to
be assigned, transferred, contributed and conveyed to the Partnership pursuant
to this Agreement. To the extent any such assets are identified at a later
date, the Parties shall take all appropriate action required in order to
assign, transfer, contribute or convey such assets to the Partnership.
Likewise, to the extent that any assets or operations that are indirectly
assigned, transferred, contributed or conveyed to the Partnership hereunder
are later identified by the Parties as assets and operations that the Parties
did not intend to assign, transfer, contribute or convey to the Partnership,
the Parties shall take all appropriate action required to assign, transfer,
contribute or convey such assets and operations to VTDC.

6.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Following the Closing Date, the Parties shall
cooperate fully with each other and shall make available to the other, as
reasonably requested and at the expense of the requesting Party, and to any
Governmental Authority responsible for the administration of any tax, all
information, records or documents relating to tax liabilities or potential tax
liabilities of the Subject Entities for all periods at or prior to the
Effective Time and any information which may be relevant to determining the
amount payable hereunder, and shall preserve all such information, records and
documents at least until the expiration of any applicable statute of
limitations or extensions thereof.

6.4 Cooperation for Litigation and Other Actions. Each Party shall cooperate
reasonably with each other Party, at the requesting Party's expense (but
including only out-of-pocket expenses to unaffiliated third parties,
photocopying and delivery costs and not the costs incurred by either Party for
the wages or other benefits paid to its officers, directors or employees), in
furnishing reasonably available information, testimony and other assistance in
connection with any Claims or other disputes involving any of the Parties
hereto (other than in connection with disputes between the Parties).

6.5 Retention of and Access to Books and Records.

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event before 90 days after the
Closing Date, VTDC will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Partnership,
the Books and Records that are in the possession or control of VTDC or its
Affiliates.

(b) The Partnership agrees to afford VTDC and its Affiliates and their
respective accountants, counsel and other designated individuals, during
normal business hours, upon reasonable request, at a mutually agreeable time,
full access to and the right to make copies of the Books and Records at no
cost to VTDC or its Affiliates (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses); provided that such access will not be construed to require the
disclosure of Books and Records that would cause the waiver of any attorney-
client, work product or like privilege; provided, further, that in the event
of any litigation, nothing herein shall limit either Party's rights of
discovery under Applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentences, the Partnership agrees to provide VTDC and its Affiliates
reasonable access to and the right to make copies of the Books and Records
after the Closing for the purposes of assisting VTDC and its Affiliates (i) in
complying with VTDC's obligations under this Agreement and any Ancillary
Document; (ii) in adjusting, prorating and settling the charges and credits
provided for under this Agreement and any Ancillary Document; (iii) in preparing tax returns; (iv) in responding to or
disputing any tax audit; (v) in asserting, defending or otherwise dealing with
any Claim or dispute, known or unknown, under this Agreement; (vi) in
asserting, defending or otherwise dealing with any third-party Claim or
dispute by or against VTDC or its Affiliates relating to the Subject Entities;
or (vii) in performing their obligations under the Omnibus Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.5 or anything
else to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to any Books and Records
the transfer or other disclosure of which to the Partnership would waive (or
would reasonably risk the waiver of) any attorney/client, work product, tax
practitioner, audit or other privilege relating to the Retained Liabilities,
VTDC shall not be required to transfer such Books and Records (or any copies
thereof) to the Partnership until the Parties enter into a mutually-agreed
joint defense agreement to allow for the sharing of common defense privileged
materials.

6.6 Tanks Under Construction. Following the Closing, VTDC agrees that it will
complete or cause to be completed, the construction of tank TK-80-2 owned by
Valero Meraux and tank TK-201 owned by Valero Three Rivers (collectively, the
"Under Construction Tanks") in an expeditious, diligent and good and
workmanlike manner and at VTDC's sole cost and expense, and the Partnership
shall be entitled to participate in all stages of planning, scheduling,
implementing and oversight of construction. Any Losses, Claims and
Encumbrances that may arise out of the performance of such work on the Under
Construction Tanks shall constitute Partnership Indemnified Costs, except to
the extent they (a) arise out of the acts, omissions or negligence of any of
the Partnership Indemnified Parties or (b) constitute Special Damages (other
than Special Damages of the types identified in clauses (a) and (b) of the
definition of Partnership Indemnified Costs). Neither VTDC nor its Affiliates
shall be entitled to any additional consideration by reason of VTDC's
undertakings in this Section 6.6, other than the consideration set forth in
Section 2.2(a), nor shall VTDC's undertakings in this Section 6.6 affect
VTDC's or its Affiliates' obligations under the Terminal Services Schedules.

6.7 NYSE. Prior to the issuance of the Unit Consideration, the Partnership
shall cause the Unit Consideration to be approved for listing on the New York
Stock Exchange.

ARTICLE VII 
INDEMNIFICATION

7.1 Indemnification. From and after the Closing and subject to the provisions
of this Article VII, (a) VTDC agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Partnership Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Partnership
Indemnified Costs and (b) the Partnership agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the VTDC Indemnified Parties from and against any and all VTDC
Indemnified Costs. For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to Section 7.5, the
foregoing indemnification is intended to be in addition to and not in
limitation of any indemnification to which the Parties may be entitled under
the Ancillary Documents. For purposes of calculating Indemnified Costs (but
not determining whether a breach has occurred), no effect shall be given to
any qualifications of representations or warranties as to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect. 7.2 Defense of Third-Party Claims. An Indemnified Party shall give prompt
written notice to VTDC or the Partnership, as applicable (the "Indemnifying
Party"), of the commencement or assertion of any Claim by a third party
(collectively, a "third-party action") in respect of which such Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification hereunder. Any failure so to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that it, he, or she may have to such Indemnified Party under this Article VII
unless the failure to give such notice materially and adversely prejudices the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume
control of the defense of, settle, or otherwise dispose of such third-party
action on such terms as it deems appropriate; provided, however, that:

(a) The Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense of such third-party action (provided, however, that
the Indemnifying Party shall pay the attorneys' fees of the Indemnified Party
if (i) the employment of separate counsel shall have been authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of such
third-party action; (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to have charge of
such third-party action; (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be defenses available to such Indemnified Party that
are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party;
or (iv) the Indemnified Party's counsel shall have advised the Indemnified
Party in writing, with a copy delivered to the Indemnifying Party, that there
is a material conflict of interest that could violate applicable standards of
professional conduct to have common counsel);

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party before entering into or making any settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment of the validity of such third-party action or any
liability in respect thereof if, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment, injunctive or other
equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified Party or if, in the
opinion of the Indemnified Party, such settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment could have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Indemnified Party;

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement without the consent of the Indemnified Party that
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant
or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in
respect of such third-party action; and

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control (but shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any third-party action
(i) as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense within a
reasonable length of time or (ii) to the extent the third-party action seeks
an order, injunction, or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party
which, if successful, would materially adversely affect the business,
operations, assets, or financial condition of the Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of
any Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying
Party. The Parties shall extend reasonable cooperation in connection with the defense
of any third-party action pursuant to this Article VII and, in connection
therewith, shall furnish such records, information, and testimony and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials, and appeals as may
be reasonably requested.

7.3 Direct Claims. In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification hereunder which is not subject to Section 7.2 because no
third-party action is involved, the Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of any Indemnified Costs which such Indemnified
Party claims are subject to indemnification under the terms hereof. Subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 7.4(a), the failure of the Indemnified
Party to exercise promptness in such notification shall not amount to a waiver
of such claim unless the resulting delay materially prejudices the position of
the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim.

7.4 Limitations. The following provisions of this Section 7.4 shall limit the
indemnification obligations hereunder:

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Indemnified Costs
pursuant to this Article VII unless a written claim for indemnification in
accordance with Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 is given by the Indemnified Party
to the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto on or before 5:00 p.m., San
Antonio, Texas time, on or prior to the date that is 18 months after of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that written claims for indemnification (i)
for Indemnified Costs arising out of a breach of any representation or
warranty contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.6 (the
"Fundamental Representations") may be made at any time and (ii) for
Indemnified Costs arising out of a breach of any covenant may be made at any
time prior to the expiration of such covenant according to its terms.

(b) An Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay for any Indemnified
Costs under this Article VII until the amount of all such Indemnified Costs
exceeds, in the aggregate, $2,437,500 (with the Indemnifying Party only being
responsible for Indemnified Costs in excess of such amount). The aggregate
liability of an Indemnifying Party under this Article VII shall not exceed
$48,750,000. The limitations in the previous two sentences shall not apply to
Indemnified Costs to the extent such costs arise out of a breach of any
Fundamental Representations.

(c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, after the Closing Date,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Partnership's and the other Partnership Indemnified Parties' and VTDC's and
the other VTDC Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
the Indemnified Costs shall be in accordance with, and limited by, the
provisions set forth in this Article VII.

7.5 Remedies Under Ancillary Documents. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that this Article VII is not the remedy for and does not limit the Parties'
remedies for matters covered by the indemnification provisions contained in
the Ancillary Documents. Any indemnification obligation of VTDC to the
Partnership Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, or the Partnership to the
VTDC Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, pursuant to this Article VII
shall be reduced by an amount equal to any indemnification recovery by such
Indemnified Parties pursuant to the other Ancillary Documents between the
Parties to the extent that such other indemnification recovery arises out of the same event or circumstance giving rise to the
indemnification obligation of VTDC or the Partnership, respectively,
hereunder.

7.6 Tax Related Adjustments and Tax Reporting of Transactions.

(a) VTDC and the Partnership agree that any payment of Indemnified Costs made
hereunder will be treated by the Parties on their tax returns as an adjustment
to the Cash Distribution.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in clause (iii) of this Section 7.6(b), VTDC
and the Partnership further acknowledge and agree that the transactions
described in this Agreement are properly characterized as transactions
described in Sections 721(a) and 731 of the Code and agree to file all tax
returns in a manner consistent with such treatment. In this regard, VTDC and
the Partnership agree that the Cash Distribution shall be treated (i) as a
"debt-financed transfer" to VTDC under Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5(b)
to the extent the cash is traceable under the principles of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.163-8T to VTDC's allocable share, determined under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5(b)(2), of indebtedness of the Partnership,
(ii) as a reimbursement of capital expenditures (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d)) with respect to the tankage and
related assets owned by either Subject Entity, to the extent that VTDC
provides to the Partnership on or before January 15, 2017 a statement that
states the amount of qualifying capital expenditures and evidence satisfactory
to the Partnership documenting the capital expenditures and their
qualification, and (iii) as the proceeds of a sale of assets by VTDC to the
Partnership to the extent clause (i), clause (ii), or any other exception to
the "disguised sale" rules under Section 707 and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder, are inapplicable. The Parties acknowledge that the Subject
Entities are disregarded for federal income tax purposes as entities apart
from VTDC. Except with the prior written consent of VTDC, the Partnership
agrees to act at all times in a manner consistent with the foregoing intended
treatment of the Cash Distribution, including, if required, disclosing the
distribution of the Cash Distribution in accordance with the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-3(c)(2).

7.7 Express Negligence Rule. THE FOREGOING INDEMNITIES ARE INTENDED TO BE
ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND SCOPE
THEREOF NOTWITHSTANDING ANY EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE OR ANY SIMILAR DIRECTIVE
THAT WOULD PROHIBIT OR OTHERWISE LIMIT INDEMNITIES BECAUSE OF THE SOLE,
CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR FAULT OF ANY OF
THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.

Party, and the receiving Party shall be entitled to retain any Confidential
Information in electronic form stored on automatic computer back-up archiving

8.1) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement. 8.8 Assignment of Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned by either Party without

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, as detailed in the
