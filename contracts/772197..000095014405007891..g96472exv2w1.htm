ARTICLE I 

   

 _THE MERGER_  

   

 1.1. _The Merger_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the FBCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with Section 607.1101 of the FBCA and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of the Merger Sub in accordance with Section 607.1106 of the FBCA. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. The effect of the Merger on the capital stock of the Company is set forth in Article III. 

  

 1.2. _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), including this Agreement or an appropriate plan of merger, with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the FBCA (the date and time of such filing being the " _Effective Time_ "). Prior to such filing, a Closing shall be held at the offices of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, or such other place as the parties shall agree, for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be, of the conditions set forth in Article VIII. 

  

 1.3. _Subsequent Merger_. (a) Immediately following the Effective Time and in accordance with the FBCA, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to merge with and into Sister Subsidiary in accordance with Section 607.1101 of the FBCA and the separate corporate existence of the Surviving Corporation shall thereupon cease (the " _Subsequent Merger_ ").

 (b) At the effective time of the Subsequent Merger and without any further action on the part of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Sister Subsidiary or any holder of any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Sister Subsidiary, each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Subsequent Merger shall continue as one share of 

   ##### 

  

  

common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Sister Subsidiary, which shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of Sister Subsidiary.

   

 (c) After the Subsequent Merger, references herein to the Surviving Corporation shall refer to Sister Subsidiary. 

  

 (d) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" with respect to the Merger and Subsequent Merger, taken together, for United States federal income tax purposes pursuant to which, for such purposes, the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, are to be treated as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code (to which each of Parent, Sister Subsidiary and the Company are to be parties under Section 368(b) of the Code) in which the Company is to be treated as merging directly with and into Sister Subsidiary with the Company Common Stock converted in such merger into the right to receive the consideration provided for hereunder. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

 _THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_  

   

 2.1. _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the applicable provisions of the FBCA.

 2.2. _Articles of Incorporation_. At both the Effective Time and the effective time of the Subsequent Merger, the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by Law (the " _Articles of Incorporation_ ") except that Article I thereof shall be amended, by the filing of the Articles of Merger or other appropriate documents, to read in its entirety as follows: "The name of the corporation is Ivax Corporation".

 2.4. _Directors_. Subject to requirements of applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time and from and after the effective time of the Subsequent Merger, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws.

ARTICLE III 

   

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_  

   

 3.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock, and any other shares of capital stock of the Company, that is owned by the Company directly or indirectly or by Parent, shall automatically be retired and shall cease to be outstanding, and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

  

 (b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 3.1(c) and 3.3, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be retired in accordance with Section 3.1(a)), including each Right attached thereto, shall be converted into the right to receive the following consideration (the "Merger Consideration"): 

   

 (i) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant to Section 3.1(d) (each a " _Cash Electing Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "). 

   

 (ii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") is properly made and not revoked pursuant to Section 3.1(d) (each a " _Stock Electing Share_ " and, together with each Cash Electing Share, an " _Electing Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive 0.8471 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 3.3), of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable ordinary shares, par value NIS 0.10, of Parent, duly issued and credited as fully paid (collectively, the " _Parent Ordinary Shares_ ") which will trade in the United States in the form of American Depositary Shares (" _Parent ADSs_ "), evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (" _Parent ADRs_ ") (such Parent ADSs, together with any cash in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs to be paid pursuant to Section 3.2(f), the " _Stock Consideration_ "). Each Parent ADS represents one Parent Ordinary Share. 

   

 (iii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which no Cash Election or Stock Election is properly made (or if made, has been revoked) (each, a " _Non-Electing Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration as determined in accordance with Section 3.1(c) below. 

   ##### 

  

  

As of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be retired and shall cease to be
outstanding, and each holder of a certificate representing any such share(s)
of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive upon the surrender of
such certificates (for each share of Company Common Stock previously
represented thereby) the Merger Consideration.

   

 (c) _Proration_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to Sections 3.1(a) and 3.3): 

   

 (i) The Cash Percentage (as defined below) of the shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such number, the " _Aggregate Cash Number_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and all other shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. The " _Cash Percentage_ " shall be equal to 50%. 

   

 (ii) If the aggregate number of Cash Electing Shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the Aggregate Cash Number, then (A) all Stock Electing Shares and Non-Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and (B) the number of Cash Electing Shares of each stockholder of the Company that shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Electing Shares of such stockholder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Aggregate Cash Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number, with the remaining number of such holders Cash Electing Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. 

   

 (iii) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Aggregate Cash Number (such difference between the Cash Election Number and Aggregate Cash Number, the " _Cash Shortfall Number_ "), then (x) all Cash Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and (y) the Stock Electing Shares and Non-Electing Shares shall be treated in the following manner: 

   

 (1) if the Cash Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the aggregate number of Non-Electing Shares, then (x) all Stock Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and (y) the Non-Electing Shares of each stockholder of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Electing Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (I) the number of Non-Electing Shares of such stockholder by (II) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Non-Electing Shares, with the remaining number of such holders Non-Electing Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or 

   

 (2) if the Cash Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing Shares, then (x) all Non-Electing Shares shall be converted into the right 

   ##### 

  

   

to receive the Cash Consideration and (y) the number of Stock Electing Shares
of each stockholder of the Company that shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (I) the number of Stock Electing Shares of such stockholder by
(II) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Cash
Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing Shares, and the
denominator of which is the aggregate number of Stock Electing Shares, with
the remaining number of such holders Stock Electing Shares being converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. 

  

 (d) _Exercise of Election_. 

   

 (i) All elections in accordance with this Section 3.1(d) shall be made on a form designed for that purpose and mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent (a " _Form of Election_ ") which will be filed as an exhibit to the F-4 Registration Statement and mailed to the holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting or such other date as Parent and the Company mutually agree (the " _Form of Election Record Date_ "). The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock (or, in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation) who wishes to make a Cash Election or a Stock Election or a combination of both for any and all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder. The Company shall make available one or more Forms of Election as may be reasonably requested by any Person who becomes a holder (or beneficial owner) of shares of Company Common Stock between the Form of Election Record Date and the close of business on the day prior to the Election Date. 

   

 (ii) For elections to be effective, (A) with respect to shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates, a Form of Election must be properly completed, signed and actually received by the Exchange Agent and accompanied by the Certificates representing all the shares of Company Common Stock as to which such a Form of Election is being made, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or accompanied by an appropriate guarantee of delivery by an Eligible Guarantor Institution, as that term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, provided that such certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee, or an affidavit of lost certificate in accordance with Section 3.2(e)), or (B) with respect to shares of Company Common Stock that are held in book-entry form (each, a " _Book Entry Share_ "), Parent shall establish procedures for the delivery of such shares, which procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (either of (A) or (B), an " _Election_ "). 

   

 (iii) An Election must be received by the Exchange Agent not later than 5:00 p.m. New York City time on (A) the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting or, (B) if the Closing Date is more than four (4) Business Days following the Company Stockholders Meeting, two (2) Business Days preceding the Closing Date (either of (A) or (B), the " _Election Date_ ") in order to be effective. Any shares of Company Common Stock for which the record holder has not, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 

   ##### 

  

   

Election Date, properly submitted a properly completed Election Form to the
Exchange Agent will be deemed to be Non-Electing Shares. After a Cash
Election or Stock Election is validly made with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock, no further registration of transfers of such shares
shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Company, unless and until
such Cash Election or Stock Election is properly revoked. In addition,
all Election Forms shall automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent is
notified in writing by Parent and the Company that the Merger has been
abandoned. 

   

 (iv) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election Date at least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Date shall be subsequently delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Date. 

   

 (v) Parent shall have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have been properly completed, signed, and timely submitted or to disregard defects in forms. Any such determination of Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. Any shares of Company Common Stock relating to which the record holder is deemed to have not submitted a valid Election on or prior to the Election Date shall be deemed to be Non-Electing Shares. 

   

 (vi) Any Cash Election or Stock Election may be revoked with respect to all or a portion of the shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto by the holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Election Date. In addition, Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall automatically be revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article IX. If a Cash Election or Stock Election is revoked with respect to shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate, such Certificate shall promptly be returned to the holder that submitted the same to the Exchange Agent. 

   

 (vii) The Exchange Agent shall make all the computations contemplated by this Section 3.1, including the determination of the number of Cash Electing Shares, Stock Electing Shares and Non-Electing Shares and, after consultation with Parent, all such computations will be conclusive and binding on the former holders of shares of the Company Common Stock absent manifest error. The Exchange Agent may, with the agreement of Parent and the Company, make such reasonable rules as are consistent with this Section 3.1 for the implementation of the Elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or desirable to effect fully such Elections. 

  

 (e) _Company Options, Etc_. 

   

 (i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action 

   ##### 

  

   

necessary or appropriate to provide that each outstanding option to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock, including, without limitation, any option
granted under the Companys 1985 Stock Option Plan, the Companys 1997
Employee Stock Option Plan, the Companys 1994 Stock Option Plan and the
Companys 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan (each, a " _Company Option_ ")
shall become fully vested and exercisable (whether or not
currently exercisable) as of the Effective Time. In addition, the Company
shall take all action necessary or appropriate to provide that each Company
Option that is outstanding as of the Effective Time, but conditioned upon
consummation of the Merger, shall, to the extent such Company Options have
not been exercised as of the Effective Time, be converted into an option to
purchase a number of Parent ADSs determined by multiplying (A) the number of 
shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Option by (B) the
Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share); at an exercise
price per Parent ADS determined by dividing (I) the per share exercise price
applicable to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(II) the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) (each, a "
_Parent Option_ "). Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the
terms of each Parent Option shall be substantially identical to or more
favorable to the holder of the Company Option than the terms of the Company
Option to which it relates, determined immediately prior to the Effective
Time. On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall file an appropriate
Registration Statement on Form S-8 with respect to the offering of the Parent
ADSs issuable upon exercise of the Parent Options (the " _S-8
Registration Statement_ ") and, as promptly as practicable, shall comply with
the terms of Section 7.7 so that the holders of Parent Options may, subject
to applicable Law, freely sell the Parent ADSs issuable upon exercise of the
Parent Options. Following the Effective Time, Parent will, as promptly as
practicable, send to each holder of a Parent Option a written notice setting
forth (1) the number of Parent ADSs subject to such Parent Option and (2)
the exercise price per Parent ADS issuable upon exercise of such Parent
Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not permit options
granted under the Companys 1985 Stock Option Plan, the Companys 1994 Stock
Option Plan, the Companys 1997 Stock Option Plan and the Companys 2004
Incentive Compensation Plan to be exercised by the cancellation of a portion
of the shares to be exercised as payment of the exercise price and
satisfaction of any tax withholding obligation (a "net exercise" of options),
so as to permit Parent to assume such Plans and simultaneously comply with
Israeli law. The Company and Parent shall take all commercially reasonable
action that may be necessary (under the Company Stock Option Plans and
otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.1(e)(i). 

   

 (ii) Prior to the date hereof, the Company shall take all actions that are necessary or appropriate to provide that the Companys stock purchase plans, including without limitation, the Companys 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, shall be modified, terminated and/or suspended so that no purchase of Company Common Stock shall occur after September 30, 2005. With respect to the Companys 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the rights of participants thereunder with respect to any offering period then underway shall be determined by shortening the offering period so that the last day of such offering period shall be September 30, 2005 and by making such other appropriate adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period and otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under such plan.

 3.2. _Exchange of Share Certificates_. 

  

 (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate The Bank of New York, which currently acts as the depository for the ADSs, or another U.S. bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (in such capacity, the "Depository"), to act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holders shall become entitled from time to time with respect to such holders shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to deposit or cause the Depository to deposit with the Exchange Agent substantially all of: (x) that number of Parent ADRs and Parent Ordinary Share certificates, as applicable, in any denominations as the Exchange Agent shall specify and (y) cash, in each case as are issuable or payable, respectively, pursuant to this Article III in respect of shares of Company Common Stock for which Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been properly delivered to the Exchange Agent; and within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit the balance of such Merger Consideration with the Exchange Agent. The deposit made by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 3.2(a) is hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund." The Exchange Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments provided for in Section 3.2(b). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement; _provided_ , that Parent may direct the Exchange Agent to invest the Exchange Fund in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be promptly paid to Parent. Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time, allot Parent Ordinary Shares referred to in Sections 3.1(b) subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. 

   

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of Non-Electing Shares (these holders, the " _Non-Electing Holders_ "), (A) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such holder representing Non-Electing Shares shall pass only upon delivery of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration or, in the case of Book Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) (x) Each holder of Electing Shares who properly made and did not revoke a Cash Election or Stock Election shall be entitled to receive, in exchange for such stockholders Electing Shares, and 

   

 (y) upon surrender by a Non-Electing Holder to the Exchange Agent of any Certificate (or evidence of loss in lieu thereof) or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, for cancellation together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the Non-Electing Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, 

   

 in each case, the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III, and the Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such  shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, and the Person requesting such issuance pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establishes to the satisfaction of Parent and the Company that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

   

 (iii) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent constituting part of the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates or Book Entry Shares not surrendered until such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, are surrendered as provided in this Section 3.2. Following such surrender, in addition to the Merger Consideration, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the securities of Parent have been registered, (A) at the time of surrender, the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such securities and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to surrender and with a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such securities. 

  

 For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit corporations), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature. 

  

 (c) _Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund relating to the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Stock six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or another affiliate of Parent, as may be designated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with 

   ##### 

  

  

this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the
Merger Consideration upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

   

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (f) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no fractional Parent ADSs will be issued and any holder of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive a fractional Parent ADS but for this Section 3.2(f) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof, which payment shall represent such holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds for the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of such holder of the aggregate fractional Parent ADS that such holder otherwise would be entitled to receive. Any such sale shall be made by the Exchange Agent within five (5) Business Days after the date upon which the Certificate (or affidavit(s) of loss in lieu thereof) that would otherwise result in the issuance of such fractional Parent ADSs has been received by the Exchange Agent. 

  

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article III such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under provision of any federal, state, local or foreign tax law. Parent represents and warrants to the Company that, as of the date of this Agreement, no withholding is required to be made from the consideration payable by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to any Person pursuant to this Article III pursuant to applicable Israeli laws. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Options in respect of which Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 (ii) Except as set forth on Section 5.1(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby (including pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement) will not constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, either the articles of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable governing instruments) of the Company or of any Significant Subsidiary of the Company, (B) a breach or violation of, a default under, the acceleration of any obligations, the loss of any right or benefit, or the creation of a lien, pledge, security interest or other encumbrance on the assets of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to, any agreement, lease, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation not otherwise terminable by the other party thereto on ninety days or less notice (" _Contracts_ ") binding upon the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any Law or governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any of the Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any breach, violation, default, acceleration, creation or change that would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (i) The filings required to be made by the Company since December 31, 2001 under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), including all forms, registration, proxy and information statements, reports, agreements (oral or written) and all documents, exhibits, amendments and supplements appertaining thereto, and complied, as of their respective dates, in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the appropriate statutes and the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, including any 

   #####

respects, in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any
amendments thereto) promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (y) each of the Companys press

There are no material SEC inquiries or investigations, other material governmental inquiries or investigations or material internal investigations pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any director or executive officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (j) _Employee Benefits_.

   ##### 

  

   

any of its Subsidiaries, or to which contributions are made or otherwise
required to be made, by such Person or any of its Subsidiaries, together with
any trust agreement or insurance contract forming a part of such Compensation
and Benefit Plan. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof a copy of all material Compensation and Benefit Plans of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Compensation and Benefit Plans_
"). 

   

 (ii) All Company Compensation and Benefit Plans, to the extent subject to ERISA and the Code, are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Law. Each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _Pension Plan_ ") and that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, if applicable) from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "), and nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or that would reasonably be expected to result in penalties or fines to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries related to such loss of qualification. There is no material pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation or other governmental proceeding relating to the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Pension Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a material tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. 

   

 (iii) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity that is considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to a multi-employer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the thirty (30) day reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than an extension pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the twelve (12) month period ending on the date hereof. 

   

 (iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan subject to United States law have been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company Reports. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan subject to United States Law of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no U.S. ERISA Affiliate has an 

   ##### 

  

   

outstanding funding waiver. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Pension Plan subject
to United States law or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

None of the Parent Reports (in the case of Parent Reports filed pursuant to the Securities Act), as of their effective dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading. None of the Parent Reports (in the case of Parent Reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act) as of the respective dates filed with the SEC or first mailed to stockholders, as applicable, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the Parent Reports (in the case of Parent Reports issued to the public as press releases) as of their respective release dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

   

 (ii) The consolidated financial statements of the Parent and its Subsidiaries included in such Parent Reports complied, as of the effective file or release dates thereof, as applicable, as to form in all material respects with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules) presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Parent and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of income and of consolidated statements of cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of operations, retained earnings and changes in 

   ##### 

  

   

financial position, as the case may be, of the Parent and its Subsidiaries for
the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to the absence of notes, similar presentation items and normal year-end audit
adjustments), in each case in accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein. Any material
change by Parent in the accounting principles, practices or methods used in
such financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included in
the Parent Reports has been appropriately disclosed in such financial
statements. Parents disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) effectively enable
Parent to comply with, and the appropriate officers of Parent to make all
certifications required under, the Sarbanes Oxley Act; and Parent
has designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such
internal control over financial reporting to be designed under its
supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Parent
qualifies as a "foreign private issuer" as defined in Rule 3b-4 under the
Exchange Act. 

  

 (f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) any Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the time such Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is filed with the SEC or at the time such Registration Statement becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the times of meetings of stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. When filed, the Registration Statements will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. No representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Registration Statement. 

  

 (g) _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. Except as set forth on Section 5.2(g) of the Parent Disclosure Schedules, there are no liabilities or obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever in existence on the date hereof, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, of a nature required to be set forth in the Parents balance sheet under U.S. GAAP or the notes thereto, other than: (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided for in the Parent balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 included in the Parent Reports or in the notes thereto or in the Parent Reports filed prior to the date hereof; (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices since the Audit Date; (iii) liabilities and obligations under Contracts in effect as of the date hereof not in violation of the terms of this Agreement; and (iv) liabilities or obligations that would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as described in the Parent Reports or as set forth on Section 5.2(h) of the Parent Disclosure Schedules, since the Audit Date, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole have conducted their business only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary and usual course of such business and there has not been (i) any change in the financial condition, properties, assets, business or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries that has had or would be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution in respect of the capital stock of Parent or any repurchase, redemption or other acquisition by Parent or any Subsidiary of any securities of Parent other than regular quarterly dividends on shares of Parent capital stock in the ordinary course (including, in the case of Parent Ordinary Shares, any periodic increase thereon consistent with past practice) or (iii) any change by Parent in accounting principles, practices or methods which is not required or permitted by U.S. GAAP. Since the Audit Date and through the date hereof, except as provided for herein, there has not been any material increase in the compensation payable or that could become payable by Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries to officers or key employees or any material amendment of any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans other than increases or amendments in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. 

  

 (i) _Litigation_. Except as described in the Parent Reports or as set forth on Section 5.2(i) of the Parent Disclosure Schedules, there are no Litigation Claims pending or, to the knowledge of Parent threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that would not be reasonably expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There are no material SEC inquiries or investigations, other material governmental inquiries or investigations or material internal investigations pending, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any director or executive officer of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (j) _Employee Benefits_. 

   

 (i) Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date hereof a copy of all material Compensation and Benefit Plans of Parent and its Significant Subsidiaries (the " _Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans_ "). 

   

 (ii) All Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans, to the extent subject to ERISA and the Code are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Law. Each Parent Pension Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS, and nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that would cause the loss of such qualification or that would result in penalties or fines to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries related to the loss of qualifications. There is no material pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened litigation or other governmental proceeding relating to Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Pension Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would subject Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to a material tax or penalty 

   ##### 

  

   

imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. 

   

 (iii) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any ERISA Affiliate. Parent and its Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to a multi-employer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the thirty (30) day reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than an extension pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Parent Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the twelve (12) month period ending on the date hereof. 

   

 (iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan subject to United States law have been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in Parent Reports. Neither any Parent Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan subject to United States Law of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no U.S. ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Pension Plan subject to United States law or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. 

   

 (v) Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries has any material obligations for, or liabilities with respect to, retiree health and life benefits under any Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan subject to United States law, except for benefits required to be provided under Section 4980B of the Code or any other applicable law requiring continuation of health coverage. 

   

 (vi) Neither the negotiation and execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan that will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee or former employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (vii) With respect to each Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan not subject to United States law (a " _Parent Foreign Benefit Plan_ "): (A) each Parent Foreign Benefit Plan is in material compliance with applicable Law; (B) each Parent Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered with a regulatory agency or authority has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with such agency or authority, and (C) as of the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of each Parent Foreign Benefit Plan is sufficient to provide for the accrued benefit obligations with respect to all 

   ##### 

  

   

current and former participants in such plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Parent Foreign Benefit Plan. 

   

 (viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.2(j), the representations and warranties contained in this Section 5.2(j) shall be deemed to be true and correct unless such failures to be true and correct are reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (k) _Material Compliance with Laws_. The business of Parent and its Subsidiaries is being conducted in material compliance with the pertinent Laws of Governmental Entities, including without limitation, the laws enforced and regulations issued by the FDA, the DEA, the HHS, the CMS and OIG, including without limitation the anti-kickback law (Social Security Act § 1128B(b)) and analogous laws of the various states, the drug price reporting requirements of titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act, and the laws precluding off-label marketing of drugs, except for violations and alleged violations that are described in the Parent Reports or would not be reasonably expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is debarred under the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 or employs or uses the services of any individual who is debarred or, to the best of Parents knowledge, has engaged in any activity that would reasonably be expected to lead to debarment. Except as described in the Parent Reports or for ongoing inspections of Parents and its Subsidiaries manufacturing facilities and product applications, which would not be reasonably expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect, no investigation or review, other than routine inspections by the FDA, by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for those the outcome of which would not be reasonably expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has all permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and other governmental authorizations, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities necessary to conduct its business as currently conducted, except for those the absence of which would not be reasonably expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent, any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any of the vendors or suppliers of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries have been excluded from participation in any federal health care program, as defined under 42 U.S.C. §1320a-7b(f), for the provision of items or services for which payment may be made under such federal health care program, nor been debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded by any state or federal department or agency. To the extent matters relating to Parents and its Subsidiaries compliance with any Laws, including with respect to Environmental Laws, are more specifically covered elsewhere in this Section 5.2, the provisions of this Section 5.2(k) shall not apply. 

   #####

Except as set forth in the Parent Reports or on Section 5.2(l) of the Parent Disclosure Schedules and except for such matters that would not, either individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to cause a Parent Material Adverse Effect: (i) the operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) each of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries possesses and maintains in effect all environmental permits, licenses, authorizations and approvals required under applicable Environmental Laws with respect to the properties and business of Parent and its Subsidiaries; (iii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written environmental claim, notice or request for information concerning any violation or alleged violation of any applicable Environmental Law, nor, to Parents knowledge, is there any existing factual or legal basis for any such claim, notice or request for information; (iv) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of a release or threat of release of any Hazardous Substances in violation of Environmental Law which would reasonably be expected to result in liability to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries at any of its or its Subsidiaries current or former properties or at any other property arising from its or any of its Subsidiaries current or former operations; (v) to Parents knowledge, there are no writs, injunctions, decrees, orders or judgments outstanding, or any actions, suits or proceedings pending relating to compliance by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with any environmental permits, licenses, authorizations and approvals required under applicable Environmental Laws or liability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under any applicable Environmental Law; and (vi) to Parents knowledge, no Lien has been placed upon any of Parents or its Subsidiaries properties (whether owned, leased or managed) under any Environmental Law. 

  

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary (including, but not limited to, Section 5.2(k)), the representations and warranties of the Company in this Section 5.2(l) constitute the sole representations and warranties of Parent with respect to any Environmental Law or Hazardous Substance.

Reorganization; 

   

 (iii) On the basis of facts presently known, Parent does not expect to be a passive foreign investment company, as defined in Section 1297(a) of the Code (a "PFIC") for its taxable year in which the Closing Date occurs and does not expect to become a PFIC for any subsequent taxable year; and

 (o) _Intellectual Property_. Except as set forth on Section 5.2(o) of the Parent Disclosure Schedules or as disclosed in the Parent Reports, 

   

 (i) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed or otherwise possesses sufficient legally enforceable rights to use and enforce all Parent Intellectual Property Rights, except for any such failures to own, be licensed, possess or enforce that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. " _Parent Intellectual Property Rights_ " shall mean all patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade names, service marks, brand names, copyrights, technology, know-how, computer software programs or applications, databases and tangible or intangible proprietary information or materials that are currently used in its and its Subsidiaries businesses. 

   

 (ii) Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (A) to Parents knowledge, the use or practice of any of Parent Intellectual Property Rights by Parent or its Subsidiaries does not conflict with, infringe upon, violate or interfere with or constitute an appropriation of any right, title, interest or goodwill, including, without limitation, any intellectual property right, patent, trademark, trade name, service mark, copyright or other intellectual property right of any other Person and (B) except with respect to ANDAs filed in the United States under paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act or with respect to applications for approval of generic pharmaceutical products filed under comparable laws or regulations in territories outside the United States, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of any claim or otherwise has knowledge that any Parent Intellectual Property Right is invalid or conflicts with any such asserted right of any other Person.

   ##### 

  

  

imperfections of title, if any, that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All
leases pursuant to which Parent and each of its Subsidiaries leases from
others material real or personal property are valid and effective in
accordance with their respective terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception, and there is not, under any of such leases, any existing default
or event of default of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge

Effect. 

  

 (q) _Material Contracts_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has breached, or received in writing any claim that it has breached any of the terms and conditions of any Contract to which it is a party or by which it is bound in such a manner as, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound that has not expired or terminated by its terms is valid and in full force and effect, binding upon Parent or such Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, except where the failure to be valid and in full force and effect or not binding, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

All such insurance policies are in full force and effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid, and Parent and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance with the terms and conditions of such policies and bonds except for failures to so comply that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 10.7. _Entire Agreement; NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the Stockholders Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedules, the Parent Disclosure Schedules and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated July 7, 2005, between Parent and the Company, as amended (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), constitute the entire agreement by and among the parties hereto, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES MADE BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. 

  

 10.8. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Other than with respect to the matters set forth in Section 7.14 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) and in Article III, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

 10.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such 

   ##### 

  

  

Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

   

 10.10. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

  

 10.11. _Disclosure Schedules_. Any information disclosed in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to be disclosed on any other section of the Company Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules, respectively, where it is reasonably apparent that the disclosure contained in such section of the Company Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules is relevant to such other sections. The Company Disclosure Schedules and the Parent Disclosure Schedules, respectively, and the information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify and limit the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, contained in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of any of such representations, warranties or covenants. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Company Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules shall be construed to establish a standard of materiality. 

  

 10.12. _Interpretation_. The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." 

  

 10.13. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of Law or otherwise; _provided, however_ , that Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, so long as such designation would not reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining any Parent Required Statutory Approval or Company Required Statutory Approval or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) significantly increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (iii) significantly increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise or (iv) materially delay the consummation of the Merger. If the requirements of the previous sentence are met and Parent wishes to designate another wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, then, all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date hereof shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as of the date of such designation.
