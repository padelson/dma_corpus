analogous laws of the various states, the drug price reporting requirements of titles XVIII and XIX
of the Social Security Act, and the laws precluding off-label marketing of drugs, except for
violations and alleged violations that are described in the Parent Reports or would not be
reasonably expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions

Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the

the same, except for those the outcome of which would not be reasonably expected to have, either

each of its Subsidiaries has all permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and
other governmental authorizations, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities necessary to
conduct its business as currently conducted, except for those the absence of which would not be
reasonably expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse

integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the party
obligated to pay (the &#147;Payor&#148;) fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.5(b) or
(c)&nbsp;to the other (the &#147;Recipient&#148;), and in order to obtain such payment the Recipient commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the Payor for payment of all or a portion of a termination
fee and/or expense reimbursement, the Payor shall pay to the Recipient its costs and expenses
(including its reasonable attorneys&#146; fees) incurred in connection with such suit, together with
interest from the date such payment was due on the amounts owed at the prime rate in effect from
time to time and quoted in <I>The Wall Street Journal </I>during such period. The payment of such
termination fee pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.5(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent if the
Agreement is terminated as described in Section&nbsp;9.5(b) and the Company shall have paid to Parent
the expense reimbursements and termination fees, as applicable.

any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a)&nbsp;a suitable and equitable provision

intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b)&nbsp;the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be

Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words &#147;include,&#148; &#147;includes&#148; or &#147;including&#148; are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words &#147;without limitation.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.13. <U>Assignment</U>. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of Law or
otherwise; <I>provided, however</I>, that Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another
wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub,
so long as such designation would not reasonably be expected to (i)&nbsp;impose any material delay in
the obtaining of, or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining any Parent Required Statutory
Approval or Company Required Statutory Approval or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period, (ii)&nbsp;significantly increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (iii)&nbsp;significantly increase the risk of not being able
to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise or (iv)&nbsp;materially delay the consummation of the
Merger. If the requirements of the previous sentence are met and Parent wishes to designate
another wholly-owned direct or
indirect subsidiary to be a constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, then, all
references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other subsidiary, except that
all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date hereof
shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as of the
date of such designation.
