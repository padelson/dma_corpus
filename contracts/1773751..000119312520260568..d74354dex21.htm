Preferred Stock owned beneficially and of record by such Company Stockholders
(the " _Written Consent_ ");

 



2

    

WHEREAS, as a condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements, Parent shall provide an opportunity
to the Parent Stockholders to exercise their rights to participate in the

Documents in conjunction with, _inter alia_ , obtaining approval from the
Parent Stockholders for the transaction contemplated hereby and by the
Ancillary Agreements;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent is entering
into subscription agreements (collectively, the " _Subscription Agreements_
") with certain investors (collectively, the " _Investors_ ") pursuant to

aggregate number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock set forth in the
Subscription Agreements in exchange for an aggregate purchase price set forth
in the Subscription Agreements on the Closing Date immediately after the
Effective Time, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein;

WHEREAS, each of the parties intends that, for U.S. federal income tax

within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "
_Code_ ") and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, (ii) the
Domestication shall constitute a transaction treated as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code, and (iii) the Merger
shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code and/or the Merger and the PIPE Financing shall be considered part of
an overall plan in which the Company Stockholders exchange their shares of
Company Capital Stock for the Merger Consideration in an exchange described
in Section 351 of the Code (collectively, the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ ");

 

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent Sponsor has entered into that certain Sponsor Agreement, dated as of
the date hereof (the " _Sponsor Agreement_ "), with Parent and the Company,
pursuant to which Parent Sponsor has agreed, immediately prior to the
Domestication, to surrender to Parent, for no consideration and as
a contribution to the capital of Parent, certain Sponsor Shares and Sponsor
Warrants;

WHEREAS, in connection with the Domestication, shares of Parent Class B
Common Stock shall automatically convert into shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock;

WHEREAS, with a view to augmenting and concentrating voting control in Parent
with Company shareholders who have a focus on long term value creation for the
purpose of providing all Company shareholders following the Merger with the
most favorable conditions for both liquidity and long term value realization
in their public company investment in shares of Parent capital stock, prior to
the Closing, the Company intends to amend and restate the Company Certificate
of Incorporation in substantially the form set forth on _Exhibit D_ attached
hereto (the " _A andR Company Dual Class_ __ _ Charter_") in order to implement
a dual class structure pursuant to which the existing shares of Company
Capital Stock shall be re-designated into shares of Company Class A Common
Stock, but solely with respect to a portion of shares of Company Capital Stock
held by Andrew Dudum (the " _CEO_ ") and any entities, directly
or indirectly, wholly-owned by the CEO (collectively, the " _CEO Affiliates_
" and, together with the CEO, the " _CEO Group_ ") representing approximately
33% of the sum of (a) the number of shares 

 



3

    

 of Company Capital Stock held by the CEO Group plus (b) underlying vested
and unvested Equity Interests held by the CEO, such shares of Company Common
Stock shall be exchanged for Company High Vote Stock, which shall have
equivalent economic rights, including dividend and liquidation rights, as the
Company Class A Common Stock, but carry additional voting rights in the form
of an additional number of votes per share in a number fixed at Closing such
that, immediately following the completion of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the issuance of Parent Class A Common Stock and Parent
Class V Common Stock pursuant to _Article II_ , the shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock and Parent Class V Common Stock held by the CEO Group shall
represent approximately (but not in excess of) ninety percent (90%) of the
aggregate voting power of all outstanding capital stock of
Parent (collectively, the " _Dual Class_ __ _ Structure"_); and

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements in connection with the foregoing and also
prescribe certain conditions to the Merger as specified herein.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, each Party hereby
agrees:

Parents comments to the Draft Closing Date Capitalization Statement, which
comments Parent shall deliver to the Company no fewer than two (2) Business

Capitalization Statement to incorporate any changes the Company, acting in
good faith, determines are appropriate. In connection with preparation and
delivery of the Draft Closing Date Capitalization Statement, the Company shall
provide reasonable supporting detail to evidence the Companys calculations,
explanations and assumptions and any documentation or information as is

Shares designated as "$20 Earn Out Shares" subject to the vesting and
forfeiture conditions provided for in _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)(iii)_
(collectively, the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), in each
case, payable without interest, to the applicable Company Stockholder in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, _Section_ __ _

(d) at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.0001

into and become one validly issued fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $0.000001 per share, of the Surviving Company and all
such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Company as of immediately following the Effective Time; and

(e) at the Effective Time, any right of repurchase or forfeiture
condition, in either case in favor of the Company, applicable to Company
Restricted Stock shall, without any further action or consent, be
automatically assigned to Parent. Following the Effective Time, each share of
Rollover Restricted Stock shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of
the Stock Plan (if applicable) and to the award agreement evidencing such
former Company Restricted Stock (including the term and vesting schedule),
subject to such adjustments as reasonably determined by the Companys Board
of Directors (or, following the Effective Time, the Parent Board or a
committee thereof administering the Stock Plan) to be necessary or appropriate
to give effect to the conversion or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the imposition on Earn Out

 



7

    

 Shares of the vesting and forfeiture conditions described in _Section_ __ _

Stock Plan (if applicable) and to the award agreement evidencing such former
Company Restricted Stock (including the term and vesting schedule), in
addition to the vesting and forfeiture conditions described in _Section_ __ _

Any such amounts or shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, Parent Class A
Warrants and Parent Class V Common Stock in book-entry form deposited with
the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Agent
Fund_ ". The Exchange Agent Fund shall be subject to the terms of this
Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_,
at the Closing, Parent shall cause to be issued or paid from the Exchange
Agent Fund to each Company Stockholder that holds Company Capital Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any shares of Company
Restricted Stock, but excluding any Company Dissenting Shares and shares of
Company Capital Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_) who
has delivered to the Exchange Agent, at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, a completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal,

8

    

 Company Stockholder and (D) notwithstanding anything in _Section_ __ _
2.4(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_ to the contrary,
an amount equal to any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such Company
Stockholder has the right to receive in respect of such Company Capital Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(g)_, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account such Company Stockholder
identified in the Letter of Transmittal for such Company Stockholder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, under no
circumstances shall Parent be required to pay to any Equity Holder or any
other Person more than the Stock Consideration, Warrant Consideration and Earn
Out Consideration, in each case, as allocated in accordance with this _Article
II_.

 

Section 2.5 _Exchange Procedures for Company Stockholders_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint Continental Stock Transfer and
Trust Company (or its applicable Affiliate) as an exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") and enter an exchange agent agreement substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _ G_ (the " _Exchange Agent
Agreement_ ").

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Not less than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail or otherwise deliver, to each Company Stockholder entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_, a letter of
transmittal substantially in the form of  _Exhibit_ __ _ H_ attached hereto,
with such changes as may be agreed between the Company and Parent prior to the
Closing or as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent (the " _Letter
of Transmittal_ "), together with any notice required pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL or the CCC. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in
_Article VI_ , in the event that at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, a Company Stockholder does not deliver to the Exchange Agent a
duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal (along with all certificates
representing shares of Company Capital Stock (each, a " _Company Certificate_
" and, collectively, the " _Company Certificates_ "), to the extent such
shares of Company Capital Stock are certificated), then such failure shall not
alter, limit or delay the Closing; _provided_ , that such Company Stockholder
shall not be entitled to receive its respective portion of the Merger
Consideration until such Person delivers a duly executed and completed Letter
of Transmittal and its Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon
delivery of such duly executed Letter of Transmittal and its Company
Certificates by such Company Stockholder to the Exchange Agent, such Company
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of
his, her or its shares of Company Capital Stock referenced in such Letter of
Transmittal. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_,
each share of Company Capital Stock shall be deemed at all times after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Per Share Merger Consideration to which it has been converted pursuant to
this _Article II_. If payment is to be made to a Person (other than the record
or registered Company Stockholder), it shall be a condition to such payment
that any Company Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the 

 



9

    

 Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment being made to a Person (other than the record or registered Company
Stockholder) or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(c) _No Further Rights_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _
2.5_ shall be deemed to have been exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the securities represented by such Company Capital
Stock and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Company of the shares of Company Capital Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Capital Stock shall
cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.

 

(d) _Equitable Adjustment_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock, Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Class B Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange, or any similar event shall have occurred (including
any of the foregoing in connection with the Domestication), excluding in each
case the Company Recapitalization, then any number, value (including dollar
value) or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Parent Class A Common Stock or
Parent Class B Common Stock will be equitably adjusted to reflect
such change; _ provided_, however, that this _ Section 2.5(d)_ shall not be
construed to permit Parent, the Company or Merger Sub to take any action with
respect to their respective securities that is prohibited by the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

(e) _Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, the record date for which is at or
after the Effective Time, shall be paid to any Company Stockholder that has
not delivered a properly completed, duly executed Letter of Transmittal and
its Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent. After the delivery of such
materials, such Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which had
become payable with respect to shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable
to such Company Stockholder.

(f) _Company Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any Company Dissenting Share shall not be converted
into the right to receive its applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to any such Company
Dissenting Share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or, if applicable,
Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code (the " _CCC_ "). Each holder of
Company Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the DGCL or the CCC, becomes
entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive payment therefor
in accordance with the DGCL or the CCC, as applicable (but only after the
value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to
the DGCL or the CCC, as

 



10

    

 applicable). If, after the Effective Time, any Company Dissenting Share
shall lose its status as a Company Dissenting Share, then any such share shall
immediately be converted into the right to receive its Per Share Merger
Consideration as if such share never had been a Company Dissenting Share, and
Parent (or following the Closing, the Company) shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to the holder
thereof, following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_, this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, its
Per Share Merger Consideration as if such share had never been a Company
Dissenting Share. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL or the CCC, as
applicable, and received by the Company, and (b) the reasonable opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make any payment or offer to
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or
demand with respect to any Company Dissenting Share. The Company shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, enforce any contractual waivers that the Equity
Holders have granted regarding appraisal rights that would apply to the
Merger.

 

(g) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no evidence of book-entry shares representing fractional shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock, Parent Class A Warrants or Earn Out Shares shall
be issued in exchange for Company Capital Stock. In lieu of the issuance of
any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former holder of Company
Capital Stock (including any shares of Company Restricted Stock, but excluding
any Company Dissenting Shares and shares of Company Capital Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_) an amount in cash (rounded up
to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Reference Price by (ii)
the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Parent Class A Common Stock, Parent Class A Warrants or Earn
Out Shares which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive, but for
this _Section_ __ _ 2.5(g)_.

 

Section 2.6 _Lost Certificate_. In the event any Company Certificate has been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the provision by such Person of (a) a bond in such
amount as Parent may reasonably require or (b) a customary indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Company or their
current or former affiliates with respect to such Company Certificate, and
Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration, deliverable in respect of any
shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time evidenced thereof (including any shares of Company Restricted Stock,
but excluding any Company Dissenting Shares and shares of Company Capital
Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_) as determined in
accordance with this _Article II_ and subject to the other deliveries required
by  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

Section 2.7 _Conversion of Company Equity Awards_.

 



11

    

(a) _Company Options_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Stock Plan (each, a " _Company Option_ ") that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase a number of shares
of Parent Class A Common Stock (each, an " _Assumed Option_ ") equal to the
product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (2) the Per Share Exchange Amount (rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, with no cash being
payable for any fractional share eliminated by such rounding), at an exercise
price per share of Parent Class A Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such
Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Per Share Exchange Amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent).

(ii) In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, each holder of Company Options shall receive for each outstanding share
of Company Common Stock underlying a Company Option, (A) an award of
restricted stock units of Parent denominated in a number of shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock (each, a " _Parent Warrant RSU_ ") equal to the product
of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (2) the Warrant Exchange Amount, multiplied by (3) the Closing
Warrant Value Amount (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any
fractional share eliminated by such rounding) and (B) an award of restricted
stock units of Parent denominated in a number of shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock (each, a " _Parent Earn Out RSU_ ") equal to the product of (1)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise
of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(2) the Earn Out Exchange Amount (rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any
fractional share eliminated by such rounding).

(b)  _Company RSUs_.

(i) At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units with respect
to shares of Company Common Stock granted pursuant to the Stock Plan (each, a
" _Company RSU_ ") that is outstanding and unsettled immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically, without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into an award of
restricted stock units with respect to a number of shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock equal to (A) the product of (1) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time

 



12

    

 multiplied by (2) the Per Share Exchange Amount (rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, with no cash being
payable for any fractional share eliminated by such rounding) plus (B) the
product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the Earn
Out Exchange Amount (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional
share eliminated by such rounding) (after such conversion, the " _Rollover
RSUs_ ", with such portion of the RSU set forth in the preceding clause (B)
being designated as a "Parent Earn Out RSU" for all purposes herein).

 

(ii) In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, each holder of Company RSUs shall receive for each of his or her
respective Company RSUs, a number of Parent Warrant RSUs equal to the product
of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (2) the Warrant
Exchange Amount (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional share
eliminated by such rounding), multiplied by (3) the Closing Warrant
Value Amount.

(c) The treatment of the Company Options specified in this _Section_ __ _
2.7_ will be subject to such modifications, if any, as are required to cause
the conversion to be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and, as applicable, Section
424 of the Code. Following the Effective Time, each Assumed Option and
Rollover RSU (collectively, each, a " _Rollover Award_ ") shall remain subject
to the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan and to the award
agreement evidencing such Company Equity Award (including the term and
vesting schedule), subject to such adjustments as reasonably determined by the
Companys Board of Directors (or, following the Effective Time, the Parent
Board or a committee thereof administering the Stock Plan) to be necessary or
appropriate to give effect to the conversion or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Companys Board of
Directors (or appropriate committee thereof) shall pass resolutions and take
such other actions as are necessary to provide for the treatment of the
Company Options and Company RSUs as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_
and Company Restricted Stock as contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, a holder of
a Company Option shall only be granted a Parent Warrant RSU and a Parent Earn
Out RSU, and a holder of a Company RSU shall only be granted a Parent Warrant
RSU and a Parent Earn Out RSU if such holder remains in continuous service to
the Company or its successor on the grant date of such award. In addition,
and for clarity, but subject to the first two sentences of _Section_ __ _
2.7(c)_, each Parent Warrant RSU and each Parent Earn Out RSU shall be subject
to substantially the same service-based vesting condition as applied to the
former Company Option or former Company RSU; _provided_ that, in addition
thereto, (i) one third of each Parent Earn Out RSU shall also be subject to
each of the share-price based performance vesting conditions described in
_Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)(i)_, (ii) an

 



13

    

 additional one third of each Parent Earn Out RSU shall also be subject to
each of the share-price based performance vesting conditions described in
_Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)(ii)_ and (iii) the remaining one third of each Parent
Earn Out RSU shall also be subject to each of the share-price based
performance vesting conditions described in _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)(iii)_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that following satisfaction of the service-based
vesting condition applicable to a Parent Earn Out RSU (and, for the avoidance
of doubt, satisfaction of the Achievement Date with respect to the applicable
portion of such Parent Earn Out RSU), such award shall remain outstanding
pursuant to its terms during the Earn Out Period following termination of the
holders continuous service.

 

Section 2.8 _Conversion of Company Warrants_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.19(b)_, each Company
Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that would automatically and fully be exercised in
accordance with its terms by virtue of the occurrence of the Merger without
the requirement of any other election or action by the Company or holder
thereof, shall automatically, without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be exercised in accordance with its terms immediately prior to the
Effective Time and such Company Warrant shall be cancelled and eligible for
the consideration set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ based upon the number of
shares of Company Capital Stock into which such Company Warrant was
automatically exercised. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall be
entitled to elect to adjust the exercise price of any such Company Warrant in
accordance with the terms thereof in order for such Company Warrant to be
automatically exercised in accordance with its terms immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_ and _Section_ __
_ 5.19(b)_, each Company Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and which is not automatically and
fully exercised in accordance with its terms pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.8(a)_) (each, an " _Assumed Warrant_ ") shall automatically, without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted
into a warrant to purchase (A) that number of shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Capital
Stock subject to such Company Warrant multiplied by (2) the Per Share Exchange
Amount, (B) a number of Parent Class A Warrants equal to the product of (1)
the number of shares of Company Capital Stock subject to such Company Warrant
multiplied by (2) the Warrant Exchange Amount and (C) that number of Earn Out
Shares equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Capital
Stock subject to such Company Warrant multiplied by (2) the Earn Out Exchange
Amount, with such Earn Out Shares being issuable upon exercise of such Parent
Class A Warrant in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.10(a)_,  _Section_ __ _
2.10(b)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)(ii)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)(iii)_,
and with each respective Earn Out Share subject to the vesting and forfeiture
conditions as are provided therein. Each Assumed Warrant shall otherwise be
subject to the same terms and conditions (including as to vesting and
exercisability) as were applicable under the respective Company Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each Assumed Warrant
shall have an exercise price per share equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (x) the per share exercise price of Parent Class A Common Stock
subject to such Assumed Warrant by (y) 

 



14

    

 the Per Share Exchange Amount (which price per share shall be rounded up to
the nearest whole cent). Upon exercise of any Assumed Warrant, no evidence of
book-entry shares representing fractional shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock, Parent Class A Warrants or Earn Out Shares shall be issued in exchange
for the Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder; in lieu of the issuance of
any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to such holder of Assumed
Warrants upon the exercise thereof (including by setoff against the exercise
price that would otherwise be tendered) an amount in cash (rounded up to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Reference Price by (ii) the
fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Parent Class A Common Stock, Parent Class A Warrants or Earn
Out Shares which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive, but for
this _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_.

Section 2.9 _Cancellation of Sponsor Shares and Sponsor Warrants_.
Pursuant to the terms of, and as further specified in, the Sponsor Agreement,
immediately prior to the Domestication, Parent and the Parent Sponsor shall
irrevocably cause to be terminated, forfeited, surrendered and cancelled, for
no consideration and without further right, obligation or liability of any
kind or nature on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the
Parent Sponsor: (a) 1,257,813 Sponsor Shares and (b) 1,004,167 Sponsor
Warrants. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the
outstanding shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Class B Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class, by reason of any dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange, or any similar event shall
have occurred (including any of the foregoing in connection with the
Domestication), then the number of Sponsor Shares and Sponsor Warrants to

_ 2.10(b)(i)_,  _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _
2.10(b)(iii)_ shall be automatically forfeited and deemed transferred to

price per share set forth set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)(i)_, _Section_
__ _ 2.10(b)(ii)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)(iii)_, then immediately prior

of Parent Earn Out RSUs set forth therein that has not previously occurred
shall be deemed to have occurred and the holders of such Earn Out Shares and
Parent Earn Out RSUs shall be eligible to participate in such Company Sale.
For avoidance of doubt, assuming no prior vesting of such Earn Out Shares and
Parent Earn Out RSUs has occurred:

 

(i) if the Company Sale Price for acquisition of the Parent Class A Common
Stock is greater than or equal to $15.00 per share of Parent Class A Common
Stock, but less than $17.50 per share of Parent Class A Common Stock, the $15
Earn Out Shares and the equivalent Parent Earn Out RSUs shall be deemed to

cancelled by Parent and cease to exist);

Stock is greater than or equal to $17.50 per share of Parent Class A Common
Stock, but less than $20.00 per share of Parent Class A Common Stock, the $15
Earn Out Shares and the equivalent Parent Earn Out RSUs and the $17.50 Earn
Out Shares and the equivalent Parent Earn Out RSUs shall be deemed to have
fully vested (and the $20 Earn Out Shares and the equivalent Parent Earn Out
RSUs shall be automatically forfeited and deemed transferred to Parent and
shall be cancelled by Parent and cease to exist); and

 

(iii) if the Company Sale Price for acquisition of the Parent Class A Common

Stock, the $15 Earn Out Shares and the equivalent Parent Earn Out RSUs, the
$17.50 Earn Out Shares and the equivalent Parent Earn Out RSUs and the $20
Earn Out Shares and the equivalent Parent Earn Out RSUs shall be deemed to
have fully vested;

_provided_ that if the Company Sale Price for acquisition of the Parent Class
A Common Stock is less than $15.00 per share of Parent Class A Common Stock,
then no Earn Out Shares or Parent Earn Out RSUs shall be deemed to have vested
and all such Earn Out Shares and Parent Earn Out RSUs shall be automatically
forfeited and deemed transferred to Parent and shall be cancelled by Parent
and cease to exist.

 



17

    

(g) If, during the Earn Out Period, the outstanding shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange, or any similar event shall
have occurred, then the applicable price per share set forth set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_ will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

 

Section 2.11 _Company Recapitalization_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time into shares of
Company Class A Common Stock and shares of Company High Vote Stock, consistent
with the Dual Class Structure (the " _Company Recapitalization_ "). In
connection with the Company Recapitalization, all shares of Company Capital
Stock shall convert into the right to receive (i) in the case of all Company
Stockholders (other than the CEO Group), the same number of shares of Company
Class A Common Stock, and (ii) in the case of the CEO Group, a combination of
shares of Company Class A Common Stock and shares of Class V common stock, par
value $0.000001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company High Vote Stock_ ")
as contemplated by the Dual Class Structure and as set forth in the AandR
Company Dual Class Charter. The related exchange agreement to be entered into
in respect of such Company High Vote Stock to be issued to the CEO Group in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ shall provide that Parent and the
Surviving Company agree to report the share exchange as a tax-
free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(E) of the Code
for all Tax purposes and agree to indemnify and hold harmless the CEO Group
for Taxes and any applicable penalties and associated costs if such exchange
is not tax free, in whole or in part.

Section 2.12 _Tax Treatment of_ _Earn_ _Out_. The Earn Out Shares shall be
treated as issued and outstanding as of the Closing and any forfeiture
thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.10_ shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration by the Parties, in each case for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by a change in applicable Tax law.

Section 2.13 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under all
applicable Laws. To the extent that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company
or the Exchange Agent withholds such amounts with respect to any Person and
properly remits such withheld amounts to the applicable Governmental Entity,
such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly furnish to the other such necessary

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and the
Closing, upon reasonable notice, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, provide to such other Party and its
Representatives during normal business hours reasonable access to all
employee, facilities, books and records of such Party and such Partys

occur in such a manner as the Company or Parent, as applicable, reasonably
determines to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) nothing herein shall
require the Company to provide access to, or to disclose any information to,
Parent or any of its Representatives if such access or disclosure, in the good
faith reasonable belief of the Company, after

(ii) would be in violation of applicable laws or regulations of any
Governmental Entity (including the HSR Act and any other applicable Laws).

_ 5.6_ shall be treated as confidential information pursuant to the terms of

Subsidiaries to, hold in confidence, and the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to not, disclose any non-public information of Parent
or Merger Sub provided hereunder, including exercising the same degree of care
as the Company exercises with its own confidential or proprietary information
of a similar nature, but in no event less than a commercially reasonable
degree of care, to prevent its unauthorized disclosure or use. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that some of the information provided to the Company
pursuant to the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ may be considered "material
non-public information" for purposes of securities Laws, and the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, abide by all securities Laws
relating to the handling of and acting upon material non-public information of
or regarding Parent or Merger Sub. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, only use any such non-public information for purposes of
consummating the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to not, disclose any portion of such
non-public information to any person other than their Representatives who are
bound by obligations of confidentiality no less protective than the terms of
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_ and who "need to know" such non-public
information in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and then only to the extent they need to know. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of
such non-public information and reasonably cooperate with Parent to prevent
further unauthorized use or disclosure. In any event, the Company shall be
responsible for any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_ by any of its
Representatives or such parties, and agrees, at its sole expense, to take
commercially reasonable measures to restrain its Representatives and such
parties from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of such non-public
information. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_ shall not (i) prohibit the Company from disclosing any
such non-public information to the extent required in order for the Company to
comply with applicable Law, provided that the Company, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, provides prior written notice of such required
disclosure to Parent and takes reasonable and lawful actions to avoid or
minimize the extent of such disclosure, at Parents sole expense, or (ii)
prohibit or limit the Company and its Affiliates from disclosing customary or
any other reasonable information concerning the transactions contemplated
hereby to the

 



62

    

 Companys investors, prospective investors and advisors bound by customary
confidentiality provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any non-
public information of Parent or Merger Sub provided to the Company pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ may be disclosed, and no notice as referenced

and its Subsidiaries (including the directors and officers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries), and Parent and/or the Group Companies, as applicable,
following the Closing with limits, terms and conditions not less favorable
than the terms of a customary directors and officers liability insurance
policy, and such other applicable customary insurance policies, for a company
whose equity is listed on NYSE which policy has a scope and amount of coverage
that is reasonably appropriate for a company of similar
characteristics (including the line of business and revenues) as Parent and
its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries).

this Agreement to the earlier of termination of this Agreement in accordance

Section 5.9 _Tax Matters_.

 



63

    

(a) The Parties intend that (i) the Domestication shall constitute
a transaction treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(F) of the Code and (ii) the Merger shall constitute a transaction
that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code and/or the Merger and the PIPE Financing will be considered part of an
overall plan in which the Company Stockholders exchange their shares of
Company Capital Stock for the Merger Consideration in a transaction
described in Section 351 of the Code. The Parties shall file all Tax Returns
consistent with, and take no position inconsistent with (whether in audits,
Tax Returns or otherwise), the treatment described in this _Section_ __ _
5.9(a)_ unless required to do so pursuant to a "determination" that is final
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. The Parties agree not to,
and not to permit or cause any Affiliate or any Subsidiary to, take any
actions or cause any action to be taken that could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger and the PIPE Financing from being considered part of an
overall plan in which the Company Stockholders exchange their shares of
Company Capital Stock for the Merger Consideration in a transaction described
in Section 351 of the Code. Each of the Parties agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to promptly notify all other Parties of any challenge to the treatment
described in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_ by any Governmental Entity.

(b) Parent and the Company hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g)
and 1.368-3(a). From the date hereof through the Closing, and following the
Closing, the Parties shall not, and shall not permit or cause their respective
Affiliates to, take any action, or knowingly fail to take any action, which
action or failure to act prevents or impedes, or would reasonably be expected
to prevent or impede, (A) the Merger qualifying for the Intended Tax
Treatment, and (B) in the case of Parent, the Domestication qualifying for the
Intended Tax Treatment.

 

(c) If, in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration
Statement / Proxy Statement, the SEC requests or requires that tax opinions
be prepared and submitted in such connection, Parent and the Company shall
deliver to Kirkland and Ellis and Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and
Hachigian, LLP, respectively, customary Tax representation letters
satisfactory to its counsel, dated and executed as of the date the
Registration Statement / Proxy Statement shall have been declared effective by
the SEC and such other date(s) as determined reasonably necessary by
such counsel in connection with the preparation and filing of the
Registration Statement / Proxy Statement, and, if required, Kirkland and Ellis
LLP shall furnish an opinion, subject to customary assumptions and
limitations, to the effect that the Intended Tax Treatment should apply to
the Domestication and, if required, Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve
Franklin and Hachigian, LLP shall furnish an opinion, subject to customary
assumptions and limitations, to the effect that the Intended Tax Treatment
should apply to the Merger. In the event that the foregoing tax opinions are
not required and the Company requests that a tax opinion be prepared by
Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian, LLP to the effect
that the Intended Tax Treatment should apply to the Merger and PIPE Financing,
or Parent requests that a tax opinion be prepared by Kirkland and Ellis LLP to
the effect that the Intended Tax Treatment should apply to the
Domestication, Parent and the Company shall execute and deliver customary Tax
representation letters satisfactory to Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve

 



64

    

 Franklin and Hachigian, LLP or Kirkland and Ellis LLP, as applicable, at such
time or times as may be reasonably requested by Gunderson Dettmer Stough
Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian, LLP or Kirkland and Ellis LLP, as applicable.

(d) _Tax Matters Cooperation_. Each of the Parties shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by another Party, in connection with the filing of
relevant Tax Returns, any claim for a refund of any Tax, and any audit or
Tax proceeding. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other Partys reasonable request) the provision (with the right to make
copies) of records and information reasonably relevant to any tax proceeding
or audit, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder and making available to the shareholders of Parent prior to the
Merger information reasonably necessary to compute any income of any such
holder (or its direct or indirect owners) arising (i) if applicable, as a
result of Parents status as a "passive foreign investment company" within the
meaning of Section 1297(a) of the Code or a "controlled foreign corporation"
within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code for any taxable period ending
on or prior to the Closing, including timely providing (A) a PFIC Annual
Information Statement to enable such holders to make a "Qualifying Electing
Fund" election under Section 1295 of the Code for such taxable period, and (B)
information to enable applicable holders to report their allocable share of
"subpart F" income under Section 951 of the Code for such taxable period and
(ii) under Section 367(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder as a result of the Domestication. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parties agree that the cooperation contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
5.9(d)_ shall be done in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of business of the Parties.

 

(e) _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne by the
Company, and the Parties will cooperate in filing all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees.

requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2).

 

(g) _Withholding Certificates_. (i) Each Equity Holder that is a "United
States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall
deliver to the Exchange Agent a duly executed IRS Form W-9 certifying that
such Equity Holder, as the case may be, is not subject to backup
withholding; (ii) each Equity Holder that is not a "United States person"
shall deliver to Parent a duly executed applicable IRS Form W-8.

65

    

(a) Parent and the Surviving Company shall ensure, and the Surviving
Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to ensure, that (i) all rights
to indemnification now existing in favor of any individual who, at or prior to
the Effective Time, was a director or officer of Parent, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (collectively, with such individuals heirs, executors or
administrators, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") solely to the extent as
provided in the respective Governing Documents and indemnification agreements
to which Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or bound as
of the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time
and (ii) the indemnification agreements and the provisions with respect to
indemnification and limitations on liability set forth in such Governing
Documents shall not, except as required by applicable Law, be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights of the Indemnified Persons thereunder; _provided_ , that in the event
any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six (6) year period, all
rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until final disposition of any and all such claims.

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase, through a
broker mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company, and maintain in effect
for a period of six (6) years thereafter, a tail policy to the current policy
of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Parent and any
Group Company, in each case, which tail policy shall be effective for a period
from the Closing through and including the date six (6) years after the
Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred before the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain
substantially the same coverage and limits as, and contain terms and
conditions no less advantageous than, but not materially more advantageous
than, in the aggregate, the coverage currently provided by such current
policy, covering those Persons who are covered on the date hereof by such
policy and with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less advantageous than, but not materially more advantageous than, the
coverage provided under Parents or any Group Companys existing policies,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the tail premium shall not exceed 300% of the
aggregate annual premiums currently payable by Parent and the Group
Companies, as applicable, with respect to such current policies of directors
and officers liability insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premium exceeds such amount, then any such tail policy shall contain the
maximum coverage available at a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall defend and hold harmless,
as set forth as of the date hereof in the Parent Governing Documents and to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, all Indemnified Persons
with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of such individuals
services as officers or directors of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
occurring prior to the Effective Time, including the execution of, and the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. Without limitation of the
foregoing, in the event any such Indemnified Person is or becomes involved, in
any capacity, in any Action in connection with any matter, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, occurring prior to, on or after
the Effective Time, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall pay, as
incurred, such Indemnified Persons legal and other expenses (including the

66

    

 preparation) incurred in connection therewith. Parent shall pay, within
thirty (30) days after any reasonable request for advancement, all expenses,
including attorneys fees, which may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in

the Outside Date;  _provided_ , that the Company has not waived such
Terminating Parent Breach and the Company is not then in material breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other obligations under
this Agreement, which breach would give rise to a failure of a condition set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_;

 

(e) by either Parent or the Company by written notice to the other Party if
the Closing has not occurred on or prior to March 30, 2021 (the " _Outside

action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or primarily resulted
in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date and such action
or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

 

(f) by the Company by giving written notice to Parent if there has been a
Change in Recommendation;

All such notices, requests, demands, waivers and communications shall be
deemed received upon (i) actual receipt thereof by the addressee, or (ii)
actual delivery thereof to the appropriate address.

Section 9.3  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.4 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned, directly or indirectly, including by operation of law, by any Party
without the prior written consent of the other Parties.

 

Section 9.5 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.16_, this Agreement is
exclusively for the benefit of the Company, and its respective successors and
permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
under this Agreement, and for the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations
of the Company under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not be deemed to
confer upon or give to any other third party any remedy, claim, liability,
reimbursement, cause of action or other right.

Section 9.6 _Section Headings_ _; Defined Terms_. The Article and Section
headings and the words used for defined terms themselves (but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, the express definitions thereof) contained in this
Agreement are exclusively for the purpose of reference, are not part of
the agreement of the Parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 9.7 _Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc_ _._. Each Party hereby and any
Person asserting rights as a third party beneficiary may do so only if he, she
or it irrevocably agrees that any Legal Dispute shall be brought only to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or the federal
courts located in the State of Delaware, and each Party hereby consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding that
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
During the period a Legal Dispute that is filed in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 9.7_ is pending before a court, all actions, suits or
proceedings with respect to such Legal Dispute or any other Legal Dispute,
including any counterclaim, cross-claim or interpleader, shall be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such

 



83

    

 court. Each Party and any Person asserting rights as a third party
beneficiary may do so only if he, she or it hereby waives, and shall not
assert as a defense in any Legal Dispute, that (a) such Party is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason, (b) such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in such court, (c) such Partys property is exempt or immune
from execution, (d) such action, suit or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, or (e) the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is
improper. A final judgment in any action, suit or proceeding described in
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ following the expiration of any period permitted
for appeal and subject to any stay during appeal shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Laws. EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON
ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY MAY DO SO ONLY IF HE, SHE OR IT
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY
CLAIMS OR COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM
RELATING THERETO. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN
WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON
ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL
DISPUTE A NONCOMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY NOR
ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL SEEK TO
CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH A SEPARATE ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL
PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.

 

Section 9.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto) and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, in entering into this
Agreement, such Party has not relied on any promises or assurances, written or
oral, that are not reflected in this Agreement (including the Schedules
and Exhibits attached hereto) or the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 9.9 _No Strict Construction_. Notwithstanding the fact that
this Agreement has been drafted or prepared by one of the Parties, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company confirm that they and their respective
counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the joint
agreement and understanding of the Parties and the language used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express
their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied
against any Person. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises with respect to this Agreement, the terms and provisions
of the execution version of this Agreement shall control and prior drafts of
this Agreement shall not be considered or analyzed for any purpose (including
in support of parol evidence proffered by any Person in connection with this
Agreement).

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (regardless of
the laws that might otherwise

 



84

    

 govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof) as to all
matters (including Actions related hereto), including matters of validity,
construction, effect, performance and remedies.

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties agrees that
irreparable damage may occur for which monetary damages, even if available,
may not be an adequate remedy in the event that the Parties do not perform
their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Each of the Parties
acknowledges and agrees that Parent and the Company shall therefore be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any
court in the United States or in any state or province having jurisdiction
over the Parties and the matter in addition to any other remedy to which they
may be entitled pursuant hereto, and that such explicit rights of specific
enforcement are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without such rights, none of Parent, Merger Sub, nor the Company
would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate monetary
or other remedy at law. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that if
either Parent or the Company seeks an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

Section 9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or e-mail shall
be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of the
Agreement. Minor variations in the form of the signature page, including
footers from earlier versions of this Agreement or any such other document,
will be disregarded in determining a Partys intent or the effectiveness of
such signature.

Section 9.13  _Amendment; Modification_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented at any time only by written agreement of the Parties.

 

Section 9.14 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

 

Section 9.15 _Schedules_. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule
hereto referenced by a particular Section in this Agreement shall be deemed
to have been disclosed with respect to every other Schedule or Section or
subsection of any other Schedule in respect of which the applicability of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. The specification of any
dollar amount in the representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedules is not
intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use
the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in
any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not
described herein or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes
of this Agreement.

 



85

    

Section 9.16 _No Recourse_. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in
the Ancillary Agreements, all claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of
action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and such representations and
warranties are those solely of) the Parties. No Person who is not a Party,
including any current, former or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any Party, or any current, former or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall
have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach (other than
as set forth in the Ancillary Agreements), and, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, each Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities,
claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such Nonparty
Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted
by Law (other than as set forth in the Ancillary Agreements), (a) each Party
hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of
action that may otherwise be available at law or in equity, or granted by
statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a Party or otherwise impose
liability of a Party on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or
based on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego,
domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness,
undercapitalization, or otherwise, and (b) each Party disclaims any reliance
upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance of this
Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to this Agreement.

The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of
Delaware is []. The name of the registered agent of the Corporation in the
State of Delaware at such address is [].

ARTICLE III

 

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for

ARTICLE IV

_Capital Stock_

The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the
Corporation is authorized to issue is [] shares, consisting of (i) []
shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class A
Common Stock"), (ii) [] shares of Class V common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share (the "Class V Common Stock" and together with Class A Common Stock,
"Common Stock"), and (iii) [] shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001
per share ("Preferred Stock"). Subject to the rights of the holders of any
series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of any of the
Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below
the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority in voting power of the capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2)
of the DGCL, and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or
Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.

A. _Class A Common Stock and Class_ __ _ V Common Stock_. The powers,
preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights, and
the qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the Class A Common Stock
and Class V Common Stock are as follows:

1\. _Equal Status; Ranking_. Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate
of Incorporation (as amended from time to time, including the terms of any
Preferred Stock Designation (as defined below), this "Certificate of
Incorporation") or required by applicable law, shares of Class A Common Stock
and Class V Common Stock will have the same rights and powers, rank equally
(including as to dividends and distributions, and upon any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation), share ratably and be identical
in all respects and as to all matters. The voting, dividend and liquidation
rights

   

of the holders of the Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights
of the holders of the Preferred Stock of any series as may be designated by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") upon any issuance of
the Preferred Stock of any series.

 

2\. _Voting_.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Certificate of
Incorporation, as provided by law or by the resolution(s) or any Preferred
Stock Designation providing for the issue of any series of Preferred Stock,
the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock will
(i) at all times vote together as a single class on all matters (including the
election of directors) submitted to a vote or to be acted upon by written
consent (if action by written consent of the stockholders is not prohibited
at such time under this Certificate of Incorporation) of the stockholders of
the Corporation, (ii) be entitled to notice of any stockholders meeting in
accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation (as amended from time to time,
the "Bylaws"), and (iii) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such
manner as may be provided by applicable law. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein or required by applicable law, each holder of Class A Common
Stock will have the right to one (1) vote per share of Class A Common Stock
held of record by such holder and each holder of Class V Common Stock will
have the right to []1 votes per share of Class V Common Stock held of record
by such holder.

(b) Except as otherwise provided by law or by the resolution(s) or any
Preferred Stock Designation providing for the issue of any series of Preferred
Stock, the holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have the
exclusive right to vote for the election and removal of directors and for all
other purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation to the contrary, the holders of Common Stock shall not be
entitled to vote or act by written consent (if action by written consent of
the stockholders is not prohibited at such time under this Certificate of
Incorporation) on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation
(including any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms
of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock unless the holders of
such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class
with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to
this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation)
or the DGCL.

3\. _Dividends_. Subject to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock, the
holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive such dividends and distributions and other distributions
in cash, stock or property of the Corporation when, as and if declared
thereon by the Board from time to time, out of assets or funds of the
Corporation legally available therefor. The holders of shares of Class A
Common Stock and Class V Common Stock will be treated equally, identically and
ratably, on a per share basis, with respect to any dividends or distributions
as may be declared and paid from time to time by the Board out of any assets
of the Corporation legally available therefor; _ provided_, _ however_, that
in the event a dividend is paid in the form of shares of Class A Common Stock
or Class V Common Stock (or rights to acquire such shares), then the holders
of Class A Common Stock will receive shares of Class A Common Stock (or rights
to acquire such shares, as the case may be) and the holders of Class V Common
Stock will receive shares of Class V Common Stock (or rights to acquire such
shares, as the case may be), with the holders of shares of Class A Common
Stock and Class V Common Stock receiving, on a per share basis, the same
number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class V Common Stock, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may pay or make a
disparate dividend or distribution per share of Class A Common Stock or Class
V Common Stock (whether in the amount of such dividend or distribution payable
per share, the form in which such dividend or distribution is payable, the
timing of the payment, or otherwise) if such disparate dividend or
distribution is approved in advance by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock

_Note to Draft_ : High vote ratio to be updated in order to provide the CEO
Group with no greater than 90% of the voting power immediately following the
Closing; provided that the final vote ratio must be finalized and included in
the charter prior to the filing of the definitive proxy.

 and the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class V Common
Stock, each voting separately as a class.

 

4\. _Subdivisions or Combinations_. Shares of Class A Common Stock or Class V
Common Stock may not be subdivided, combined or reclassified unless the
shares of the other class are concurrently therewith proportionately
subdivided, combined or reclassified in a manner that maintains the same
proportionate equity ownership and voting rights between the holders of
the outstanding Class A Common Stock and the holders of the outstanding Class
V Common Stock on the record date for such subdivision, combination or
reclassification; _ provided_, _ however_, that shares of one such class
may be subdivided, combined or reclassified in a different or
disproportionate manner if such subdivision, combination or reclassification
is approved in advance by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Class A Common Stock and the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Class V Common Stock, each voting separately as a class.

5\. _No Preemptive or Subscription Rights_. No holder of shares of Common
Stock shall be entitled to preemptive or subscription rights.

6.  _Liquidation_. Subject to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock,
holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive ratably the assets and funds of the Corporation available
for distribution in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, unless
disparate or different treatment of the shares of each such class with respect
to distributions upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up is
approved in advance by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Class A Common Stock and the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Class V Common Stock, each voting separately as a class.

7\. _Issuance of Class_ __ _ V Common Stock_. Shares of Class V Common Stock
may be issued only to, and registered in the name of, (i) Andrew Dudum (the "
_Founder_ ") and/or (ii) any Permitted Class V Owner.

 

8\. _Mandatory Conversion of Class_ __ _ V Common Stock_.

 

(a) All shares of Class V Common Stock shall (1) automatically and without
further action on the part of the Corporation or any holder of Class V Common
Stock be converted into an equal number of fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Class A Common Stock upon any Transfer of such shares of Class V Common
Stock, except for a Permitted Transfer; and (2) be subject to conversion into
an equal number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class A Common Stock
upon adoption of a resolution by the Board at any time on or after the one-
year anniversary of the date (the " _Founder_ _Termination Anniversary Date_
") that both of the following conditions (the " _Trigger Conditions_ ") are
satisfied:

 

(i) the earliest to occur of (A) the Founders employment as Chief Executive
Officer being terminated for Cause or due to death or Permanent Disability
and (B) the Founder resigns (other than for Good Reason) as the Chief
Executive Officer of the Corporation; and

 

(ii) either (A) the Founder no longer serves as a member of the Board or (B)
the Founder serves as a member of the Board, but his service to the
Corporation is not his primary business occupation;

   

_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Founder is reinstated as the Chief
Executive Officer of the Corporation or is reelected or appointed to serve as
a member of the Board prior to the Founder Termination Anniversary Date (each
a " _Reset Event_ "), then the shares of Class V Common Stock may not be
converted pursuant to clause (2) of Section A.8(a) of this Article IV unless
and until the one-year anniversary of the date that both Trigger Conditions
are subsequently met (such date, the " _Next Founder Termination Anniversary
Date_ "); _ provided_, _ further_, that in the event of a subsequent Reset
Event, the Next Founder Termination Anniversary Date will extend until the
one-year anniversary of the date that both Trigger Conditions are
subsequently met without a Reset Event occurring prior to such anniversary.
Upon a Transfer of Class V Common Stock upon divorce by settlement, order or
decree, or as required by a domestic relations settlement, order or decree,
then any shares of Class V Common Stock Transferred thereby shall
automatically and without further action on the part of the Company or any
holder of Class V Common Stock be converted into an equal number of fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Class A Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_
, that any other outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock not so Transferred
shall not be automatically converted into Class A Common Stock and shall
remain outstanding irrespective of such automatic conversion and such Transfer
in accordance with the terms hereof.

(b) Each outstanding stock certificate that, immediately prior to such
conversion, represented one or more shares of Class V Common Stock subject to
such conversion will, upon such conversion, be deemed to represent an equal
number of shares of Class A Common Stock, without the need for surrender or
exchange thereof. The Corporation will, upon the request of any holder whose
shares of Class V Common Stock have been converted into shares of Class A
Common Stock as a result of such conversion and upon surrender by such holder
to the Corporation of the outstanding certificate(s) formerly representing
such holders shares of Class V Common Stock (if any), issue and deliver to
such holder certificate(s) representing the shares of Class A Common Stock
into which such holders shares of Class V Common Stock were converted as a
result of such conversion (if such shares are certificated) or, if such shares
are uncertificated or the stockholder otherwise consents, register such
shares in book-entry form.

(c) Following any such conversion, the reissuance of shares of Class V Common
Stock shall be prohibited, and such shares of Class V Common Stock will be
retired by the Corporation and cancelled in accordance with the DGCL and the
filing with the Delaware Secretary of State required thereby. Upon
such retirement and filing, all references herein to Class A Common Stock
will be deemed to be references to Common Stock. Each outstanding stock
certificate that, immediately prior to such retirement and filing, represented
one or more shares of Class A Common Stock will, following such retirement
and filing, be deemed to represent an equal number of shares Common Stock,
without the need for surrender or exchange thereof.

 

(d) If the Corporation has reason to believe that a Transfer giving rise to a
conversion of shares of Class V Common Stock into Class A Common Stock has
occurred but has not theretofore been reflected on the books of the
Corporation, the Corporation may request that the holder of such shares
furnish affidavits or other evidence to the Corporation as the
Corporation deems necessary to determine whether a conversion of shares of
Class V Common Stock to Class A Common Stock has occurred, and if such holder
does not within twenty-five (25) days after the date of such request furnish
sufficient evidence to the Corporation (in the manner provided in the
request) to enable the Corporation to determine that no such conversion has
occurred, any such shares of Class V Common Stock, to the extent not
previously converted, shall be automatically converted into shares of Class A
Common Stock as of the date of the transfer in question and the same will
thereupon be registered on the books, records and stock ledger of the
Corporation. In connection with any action of stockholders taken at a meeting
or by written consent (if action by written consent of the stockholders is not
prohibited at such time under this Certificate

   

of Incorporation), the stock ledger of the Corporation shall be presumptive
evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to vote in person or by
proxy at any meeting of stockholders and the class or classes or series of
shares held by each such stockholder and the number of shares of each class or
classes or series held by such stockholder.

 

9\. _Definitions_. For purposes of this Article IV of this Certificate of
Incorporation,

 

(a) "Cause" means (i) an unauthorized use or disclosure by the Founder of the

Board; or (vii) a failure by the Founder to cooperate in good faith with a
governmental or internal investigation of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers or employees, if the
Corporation has requested the Founders cooperation. A condition shall not be
considered "Cause" unless the Corporation gives the Founder written notice of
such condition within 90 days after such condition becomes known to the Board
and the Founder fails to remedy such condition within 30 days after receiving
the Corporations written notice2.

 

(b) "Good Reason" means the occurrence of any of the following events, without
the express written consent of the Founder: (i) a reduction in the Founders
base salary by more than 10% (other than across-the-board reductions affecting
similarly situated senior executives of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries); (ii) a material diminution of the Founders authority, duties
or responsibilities; or (iii) a relocation of the Founders principal
workplace by more than 30 miles. A condition shall not be considered "Good

Founders written notice.

(c) "Permanent Disability" means a permanent and total disability such
that the Founder is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by
reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which would
reasonably be expected to result in death within twelve (12) months or which

not less than twelve (12) months as determined by a licensed medical
practitioner.

 

(d) "Permitted Class V Owner" means any corporation, limited liability
company, partnership, foundation or similar entity wholly-owned (directly or
indirectly) by the Founder (including all subsequent successors and assigns),
or any trust for the benefit of the Founder, or of which the Founder is a

Control over the shares held therein; _provided_ _that_ , in each case, the
Founder has sole dispositive power and the exclusive right to direct the
voting of all of the shares of Class V Common Stock held by such entity and
the Transfer to the transferee does not involve any payment of cash,
securities, property or other consideration (other than an interest in such
entity) to the Founder.

 

(e) "Permitted Transfer" means any Transfer of a share of Class V Common
Stock:

 

(i) by the Founder to a Permitted Class V Owner; or



   2  |

_Note to Draft_ : Cause and Good Reason definitions based on the Founders
existing agreement. Each of Cause, Good Reason and Permanent Disability
should be updated to reflect the terms of any updated employment agreement to
be entered into concurrently with the Closing; provided that final definitions
of Cause, Good Reason and Permanent Disability must be finalized and included
in the charter prior to the filing of the definitive proxy.

value and whether voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law (including
by merger, consolidation or otherwise), including, without limitation, a
transfer of a share of Class V Common Stock to a broker or other nominee
(regardless of whether there is a corresponding change in beneficial
ownership), or the transfer of, or entering into a binding agreement with
respect to, Voting Control over such share by proxy or otherwise (other than
proxy(ies), voting instruction(s) or voting agreement(s) solicited on
behalf of the Board). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the pledge of shares of
Class V Common Stock by a stockholder that creates a mere security interest in
such shares pursuant to a bona fide loan or indebtedness transaction for so
long as such stockholder continues to exercise Voting Control over such
pledged shares shall not be considered a "Transfer" within the meaning of this
Article IV; _provided_ , _however_ , that a foreclosure on such shares
or other similar action by the pledgee shall constitute a "Transfer" unless
such foreclosure or similar action independently qualifies as a "Permitted
Transfer" at such time. A "Transfer" shall also be deemed to have occurred
with respect to a share of Class V Common Stock beneficially held by the
transferor, if there occurs any act or circumstance that causes such transfer
to not be a Permitted Transfer.

 

(g) "Voting Control" with respect to a share of Class V Common Stock means the
power (whether exclusive or shared) to vote or direct the voting of such
share of Class V Common Stock by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise.

(h) "Voting Threshold Date" means the date on which shares of Class V Common
Stock shall be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to
clause (1) or (2) set forth in Section A.8(a) of this Article IV.

 

10\. _Reservation of Stock_. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and
keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common
Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of
Class V Common Stock, such number of shares of Class A Common Stock as will
from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding
shares of Class V Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock.

11\. _Protective Provisions_. So long as any shares of Class V Common Stock
remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, whether by merger,
consolidation, reclassification of capital stock or otherwise, amend, alter,
change, repeal or waive any provision in Section A of this Article IV (or
adopt any provision inconsistent therewith) that would adversely affect the
rights of holders of Class V Common Stock, without first obtaining the
approval of the Founder, in addition to any other vote required by applicable
law, this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws.

B. _Preferred Stock_

 

Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more
series. The Board is hereby authorized to provide by resolution
or resolutions from time to time for the issuance, out of the unissued shares
of Preferred Stock, of one or more series of Preferred Stock, without
stockholder approval, by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law
of the State of Delaware (the "Preferred Stock Designation"), setting forth
such resolution and, with respect to each such series, establishing the number
of shares to be included in such series, and fixing the voting powers, full or
limited, or no voting power of

   

the shares of such series, and the designation, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, if any, of the shares of
each such series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof.
The powers, designation, preferences and relative, participating, optional and
other special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, and the
qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, if any, may differ from
those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. The authority of
the Board with respect to each series of Preferred Stock shall include, but
not be limited to, the determination of the following, all as may be
determined from time to time by the Board and stated in the resolution(s) or
any Preferred Stock Designation providing for the issuance of such Preferred
Stock:

 

(a) the designation of the series, which may be by distinguishing number,
letter or title;

 

(b) the number of shares of the series, which number the Board may thereafter
(except where otherwise provided in the Preferred Stock Designation) increase
or decrease (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding);

(c) the amounts or rates at which dividends shall be payable on, and the
preferences, if any, of shares of the series in respect of dividends, and
whether such dividends, if any, shall be cumulative or noncumulative;

 

(d) the dates on which dividends, if any, shall be payable;

 

(e) the redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of the
series;

 

(f) the terms and amount of any sinking fund, if any, provided for the
purchase or redemption of shares of the series;

 

(g) the amounts payable on, and the preferences, if any, of shares of the
series in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation;

(h) whether the shares of the series shall be convertible into
or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series, or any other
security, of the Corporation or any other corporation, and, if so, the
specification of such other class or series or such other security, the
conversion or exchange price or prices or rate or rates, any adjustments
thereof, the date or dates at which such shares shall be convertible or
exchangeable and all other terms and conditions upon which such conversion or
exchange may be made;

 

(i) restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same series or any other
class or series;

 

(j) the voting rights, if any, of the holders of shares of the series
generally or upon specified events; and

 

(k) any other powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or
other special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, and
any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such shares.

   

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the resolution(s) or any
Preferred Stock Designation providing for issuance of any series of Preferred
Stock may provide that such series shall be superior or rank equally or be
junior to any other series of Preferred Stock to the extent permitted by law.

 

C. _Rights and Options_. The Corporation has the authority to create and issue
rights, warrants and options entitling the holders thereof to acquire from
the Corporation any shares of its capital stock of any class or classes, with
such rights, warrants and options to be evidenced by or in instrument(s)
approved by the Board. The Board is empowered to set the exercise price,
duration, times for exercise and other terms and conditions of such rights,
warrants or options; _provided_ , _however_ , that the consideration to be
received for any shares of capital stock issuable upon exercise thereof may
not be less than the par value thereof. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class
A Common Stock a number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Preferred Stock
in respect of such rights, warrants and options outstanding from time to
time.

ARTICLE V

 

 _Directors_

A.  _General Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
managed by or under the direction of the Board, except as otherwise provided
herein or required by law.

 

B. _Election of Directors_. Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws
shall so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by
written ballot.

C. _Number of Directors_. Subject to the rights of holders of any series of
Preferred Stock to elect directors, the number of directors of the
Corporation shall be fixed solely and exclusively by resolution duly adopted
from time to time by the Board. No decrease in the number of directors
constituting the Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

D. _Classified Board_. Subject to the special rights of the holders of one or
more series of Preferred Stock to elect directors, immediately following the
Voting Threshold Date, the directors shall be divided, with respect to the
time for which they severally hold office, into three classes designated as
Class I, Class II and Class III, respectively (the "Classified Board"). The
Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office
immediately prior to the Voting Threshold Date to such classes of the
Classified Board. The number of directors in each class shall be divided as
nearly equally as is practicable. The initial term of office of the Class I
directors shall expire at the Corporations first annual meeting of
stockholders following the Voting Threshold Date, the initial term of office
of the Class II directors shall expire at the Corporations second annual
meeting of stockholders following the Voting Threshold Date, and the initial
term of office of the Class III directors shall expire at the Corporations
third annual meeting of stockholders following the Voting Threshold Date. At
each annual meeting of stockholders following the Voting Threshold Date,
directors elected to succeed those directors of the class whose terms
then expire shall be elected for a term of office expiring at the third
succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election.

E.  _Term and Removal_. Each director shall hold office until the annual
meeting at which such directors term expires and until such directors
successor is duly elected and qualified, or until such directors earlier
death, resignation, disqualification or removal. Any director may resign at
any time upon notice to the Corporation given in writing or by any electronic
transmission. Prior to the Voting Threshold Date, subject to the special
rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors,
directors may be removed with or without cause by the affirmative vote or act
by written consent (if action by written

   

consent of the stockholders is not prohibited at such time under this
Certificate of Incorporation) of the holders of a majority of the voting
power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a
single class. From and after the Voting Threshold Date, subject to the
special rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect
directors, no director may be removed from the Board except for cause and only
by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding voting stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting
together as a single class. Subject to the special rights of the holders of
any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors, in the event of any increase
or decrease in the authorized number of directors occurring after the Voting
Threshold Date, (a) each director then serving as such shall nevertheless
continue as a director of the class of which he or she is a member and (b) the
newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from such increase or
decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes of directors so
as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as is practicable.

 

F. _Vacancies_. Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred
Stock, any newly created directorship that results from an increase in the
number of directors or any vacancy on the Board that results from the death,
disability, resignation, disqualification or removal of any director or from
any other cause shall be filled solely and exclusively by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the total number of directors then in office, even if
less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director and shall not be filled by
the stockholders. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an
increase in the number of directors shall hold office for the remaining term
of his or her predecessor and until such directors successor shall have been
duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation, death or
removal. In the event of a vacancy in the Board, the remaining directors,
except as otherwise provided by law, shall exercise the powers of the full
Board until the vacancy is filled.

 

G. _Removal_. Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred
Stock, any director (including persons elected by directors to fill vacancies
in the Board) or the entire Board may be removed from office at any time, but
only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66
2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote thereon.

H. _Committees_. Pursuant to the Bylaws, the Board may establish one or more
committees to which may be delegated any or all of the powers and duties of
the Board to the full extent permitted by law.

I. _Stockholder Nominations and Introduction of Business_. Advance notice of
stockholder nominations for election of directors and other business to be
brought by stockholders before a meeting of stockholders shall be given in the
manner provided by the Bylaws. Business transacted at special meetings
of stockholders shall be limited to the purpose or purposes stated in the
notice of meeting.

To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it now exists and as it may
hereafter be amended, no current or former director of the Corporation shall
be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the
extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted
under the DGCL as the same exists or hereafter may be amended. No repeal or
modification of this Article VI shall apply to or have any adverse effect on
any right or protection of, or any limitation of the liability of, a current
or former director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal
or modification. For purposes of this Article VI, Article VII, Article IX and
Article XII, references to "director" or "officer" shall include, for the
avoidance of doubt, any person who has served as a director or officer of
Oaktree Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company.

   

ARTICLE VII

 

The Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL,
shall indemnify, advance expenses and hold harmless all persons whom it may
indemnify pursuant thereto (including current and former directors). The
Corporation may, by action of the Board, provide rights to indemnification and
to advancement of expenses to such other employees or agents of
the Corporation or its subsidiaries to such extent and to such effect as the
Board shall determine to be appropriate and authorized by the DGCL. Expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by a current or former officer or
director of the Corporation in defending any civil, criminal, administrative,
or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which such officer or director
may be entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be paid by the Corporation
in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized hereby. Any
amendment, repeal or modification of this Article VII shall not adversely
affect any rights or protection existing hereunder immediately prior to such
repeal or modification.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _Stockholder Action_

 

A. _Action without Meeting_. Subject to the terms of any series of Preferred
Stock then outstanding, from and after the time that the Founder beneficially
owns less than a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at an annual or
special meeting duly noticed and called in accordance with this
Certificate of Incorporation, (i) no action shall be taken by the
stockholders of the Corporation except at a duly called annual or special
meeting of stockholders and (ii) no action shall be taken by the stockholders
of the Corporation by written consent in lieu of a meeting.

B. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or
purposes may be called at any time by the majority of the Board, the Chairman
of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, and may not be
called by any other person or persons. Only those matters set forth in the
notice of the special meeting may be considered or acted upon at a special
meeting of stockholders of the Corporation.

ARTICLE IX

 

If any provision or provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation shall be
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance
for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of
such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of
this Certificate of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each
portion of any paragraph of this Certificate of Incorporation containing any
such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions
of this Certificate of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each such
portion of any paragraph of this Certificate of Incorporation containing any
such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be
construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect its current or former
directors, officers, employees and agents from personal liability in respect
of their good faith service or for the benefit of the Corporation to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

   

ARTICLE X

 

 _Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation_

 

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, and any other
provisions authorized by the DGCL may be added or inserted, in the manner now
or hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of
whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other
persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in
its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right
reserved in this Article X. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise
permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of
the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this
Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter,
change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, or
to adopt any new provision of this Certificate of Incorporation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in
voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall
be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision
inconsistent with, any of Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII,
Article XI, Article XII, Article XIII, Article XIV and this sentence of this
Certificate of Incorporation, or in each case, the definition of any
capitalized terms used therein or any successor provision (including, without
limitation, any such article or section as renumbered as a result of any
amendment, alteration, change, repeal or adoption of any provision (other
than such article or section as renumbered, or this sentence), in each case,
of this Certificate of Incorporation). Any amendment, repeal or modification
of any of Article VI, Article VII, and this sentence shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of any person existing thereunder
with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or
modification.

 

ARTICLE XI

 

 _Amendment of Bylaws_

 

A. _Amendment by Directors_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
powers conferred upon it by law, the Board is expressly authorized and
empowered to adopt, amend and repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Board.

B. _Amendment by Stockholders_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise
permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of
the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this
Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the Bylaws
may also be amended, altered or repealed and new Bylaws may be adopted by the
affirmative vote or written consent (if action by written consent of the
stockholders is not prohibited at such time under this Certificate of
Incorporation) of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock
of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon; provided, however, that if the
Board recommends that stockholders approve such amendment or repeal at such
meeting of stockholders, such amendment or repeal shall only require the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on such amendment, alteration or
repeal.

   

ARTICLE XII

 

A. _Forum Selection_. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and
exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring
(i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the
Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty
owed by any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any
action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers,
employees or agents arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this
Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as either may be amended from time
to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim asserting a claim against the
Corporation, its directors, officers, employees or agents governed by the
internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above,
any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an
indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
(and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is
vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court
of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter
jurisdiction. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought
to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or any other claim for which the federal
courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

 

To the fullest extent permitted by law, unless the Corporation consents in
writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts
of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the
resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").

 

B. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. If any action the subject matter of which is
within the scope of Section A of this Article XII is filed in a court other
than the applicable court specified in Section A of this Article XII (a
"Foreign Action") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be
deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the applicable
courts specified in Section A of this Article XII in connection with any
action brought in any such court to enforce Section A of this Article XII
above (an "FSC Enforcement Action") and (ii) having service of process made
upon such stockholder in any such FSC Enforcement Action by service upon such
stockholders counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

 

C. _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this Article XII shall be
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or
entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions
in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article
XII (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of this
Article XII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable)
and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and
circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. Any person
or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital
stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to
the provisions of this Article XII.

ARTICLE XIII

 

The Corporation renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or
in being offered an opportunity to participate in, an Excluded Opportunity.
An "Excluded Opportunity" is any matter, transaction or interest that is
presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or which otherwise comes

   

into the possession of, any director of the Corporation who is not an employee
of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, "Covered
Persons"), unless such matter, transaction or interest is presented to, or
acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes into the possession of,
a Covered Person expressly and solely in such Covered Persons capacity as a
director of the Corporation.

ARTICLE XIV

 

A. _Opt Out of DGCL 203_. The Corporation shall not be governed by Section 203
of the DGCL.

 

B. _Limitations on Business Combinations_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Corporation shall not engage in any business combination, at any point in
time at which the Common Stock is registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of
the Exchange Act, with any interested stockholder for a period of three (3)
years following the time that such stockholder became an
interested stockholder, unless:

1\. prior to such time, the Board approved either the business combination or
the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested
stockholder; or

2\. upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder
becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least
85% of the voting stock of the Corporation outstanding at the time the
transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock
outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested
stockholder) those shares owned by: (i) persons who are directors and also
officers; or (ii) employee stock plans in which employee participants do not
have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the
plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or

3\. at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by
the Board and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and
not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding voting stock of the Corporation which is not owned by the
interested stockholder.

C. _Definitions_. For purposes of this Article XIV, the term:

 

1\. "Affiliate" means, with respect to any person, any other person that
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with such person.

2\. "associate," when used to indicate a relationship with any person, means:
(i) any corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity
of which such person is a director, officer or partner or is, directly or
indirectly, the owner of 20% or more of any class of voting stock; (ii) any
trust or other estate in which such person has at least a 20% beneficial
interest or as to which such person serves as trustee or in a similar
fiduciary capacity; and (iii) any relative or spouse of such person, or any
relative of such spouse, who has the same residence as such person.

3\. "business combination," when used in reference to the Corporation and any
interested stockholder of the Corporation, means:

(a) any merger or consolidation of the Corporation (other than a merger
effected pursuant to Sections 253 or 267 the DGCL) or any direct or indirect
majority-owned subsidiary of the Corporation: (i) with the interested
stockholder; or (ii) with any other corporation, partnership,

   

unincorporated association or other entity if the merger or consolidation is
caused by the interested stockholder and as a result of such merger or
consolidation Section B of this Article XIV is not applicable to the surviving
entity;

(b) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other
disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions), except
proportionately as a stockholder of the Corporation, to or with the interested
stockholder, whether as part of a dissolution or otherwise, of assets of the
Corporation or of any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the
Corporation which assets have an aggregate market value equal to 10% or more
of either the aggregate market value of all the assets of the Corporation
determined on a consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all the
outstanding stock of the Corporation;

(c) any transaction which results in the issuance or transfer by the
Corporation or by any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the
Corporation of any stock of the Corporation or of such subsidiary to the
interested stockholder, except: (i) pursuant to the exercise, exchange or
conversion of securities exercisable for, exchangeable for or convertible into
stock of the Corporation or any such subsidiary which securities were
outstanding prior to the time that the interested stockholder became such;
(ii) pursuant to a merger under Section 251(g), 253 or 267 of the DGCL; (iii)
pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made, or the exercise, exchange
or conversion of securities exercisable for, exchangeable for or convertible
into stock of the Corporation or any such subsidiary which security is
distributed, pro rata to all holders of a class or series of stock of the
Corporation subsequent to the time the interested stockholder became such;
(iv) pursuant to an exchange offer by the Corporation to purchase stock made
on the same terms to all holders of said stock; or (v) any issuance or
transfer of stock by the Corporation; provided, however, that in no
case under items (iii)  (v) of this subsection (c) shall there be an
increase in the interested stockholders proportionate share of the stock of
any class or series of the Corporation or of the voting stock of the
Corporation (except as a result of immaterial changes due to fractional share
adjustments);

(d) any transaction involving the Corporation or any direct or indirect
majority-owned subsidiary of the Corporation which has the effect, directly or
indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or
series, or securities convertible into the stock of any class or series, of
the Corporation or of any such subsidiary which is owned by the interested
stockholder, except as a result of immaterial changes due to fractional share
adjustments or as a result of any purchase or redemption of any shares of
stock not caused, directly or indirectly, by the interested stockholder; or

(e) any receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit, directly or
indirectly (except proportionately as a stockholder of the Corporation), of
any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges, or other financial benefits (other
than those expressly permitted in subsections (a)-(d) above) provided by or
through the Corporation or any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary.

4\. "control," including the terms "controlling," "controlled by" and "under
common control with," means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the
power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a
person, whether through the ownership of voting stock, by contract, or
otherwise. A person who is the owner of 20% or more of the outstanding voting
stock of the Corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other
entity shall be presumed to have control of such entity, in the absence of
proof by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a presumption of control shall not apply where such person holds
voting stock, in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this
Article XIV, as an agent, bank, broker, nominee, custodian or trustee for one
or more owners who do not individually or as a group have control of such
entity.

   

5\. "interested stockholder" means any person (other than the Corporation
or any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the Corporation) that:
(i) is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the
Corporation; or (ii) is an Affiliate or associate of the Corporation and was
the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation
at any time within the three (3) year period immediately prior to the date on
which it is sought to be determined whether such person is an interested
stockholder; or (iii) an Affiliate or associate of any such person described
in clauses (i) and (ii); provided, however, that the term "interested
stockholder" shall _ not_ include: any person whose ownership of shares in
excess of the 15% limitation set forth herein is the result of any action
taken solely by the Corporation; provided, that such person shall be an
interested stockholder if thereafter such person acquires additional shares of
voting stock of the Corporation, except as a result of further corporate
action not caused, directly or indirectly, by such person. For the purpose of
determining whether a person is an interested stockholder, the voting stock of
the Corporation deemed to be outstanding shall include stock deemed to be
owned by the person through application of the definition of "owner" below but
shall not include any other unissued stock of the Corporation which may be
issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon
exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or otherwise.

6\. "owner," including the terms "own" and "owned," when used with respect to
any stock, means a person that individually or with or through any of its
Affiliates or associates:

 

(a) beneficially owns such stock, directly or indirectly; or

 

(b) has: (i) the right to acquire such stock (whether such right is
exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion
rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise; provided, however,
that a person shall not be deemed the owner of stock tendered pursuant to
a tender or exchange offer made by such person or any of such persons
Affiliates or associates until such tendered stock is accepted for purchase or
exchange; or (ii) the right to vote such stock pursuant to any agreement,
arrangement or understanding; provided, however, that a person shall not be
deemed the owner of any stock because of such persons right to vote such
stock if the agreement, arrangement or understanding to vote such stock arises
solely from a revocable proxy or consent given in response to a proxy or
consent solicitation made to ten (10) or more persons; or

(c) has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, voting (except voting pursuant to a revocable proxy or
consent as described in item (ii) of subsection (b) above), or disposing of
such stock with any other person that beneficially owns, or whose Affiliates
or associates beneficially own, directly or indirectly, such stock.

7. "person" means any individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated
association or other entity.

8. "stock" means, with respect to any corporation, capital stock and, with
respect to any other entity, any equity interest.

 

9\. "voting stock" means stock of any class or series entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors. Every reference to a percentage of
voting stock in this Article XIV shall refer to such percentage of the votes
of such voting stock.

Article I

 

Stockholders

1.1 Place of Meetings. All meetings of stockholders shall be held at such
place, if any, as may be designated from time to time by the Board of
Directors (the "Board") of Hims and Hers Health, Inc. (the "Corporation"), the
Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President or, if not
so designated, at the principal executive office of the Corporation. The Board
may, in its sole discretion, determine that a meeting shall not be held at
any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication in
accordance with Section 211(a) of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware or any applicable successor act thereto, as the same may be amended
from time to time (the "DGCL").

1.2 Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of stockholders for the election of
directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such
other business as may properly be brought before the meeting shall be held on
a date and at a time designated by the Board, the Chairman of the Board,
the Chief Executive Officer or the President (which date shall not be a legal
holiday in the place, if any, where the meeting is to be held). The Board may
postpone, reschedule or cancel any previously scheduled annual meeting of
stockholders, before or after the notice for such meeting has been sent to
the stockholders.

1.3 Special Meetings. Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or
purposes may be called at any time by a resolution adopted by the majority of
the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or, until
the Voting Threshold Date (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation),
by holders of a majority of the voting power of the Corporation acting by
written consent, and may not be called by any other person or persons. The
Board acting pursuant to a resolution may postpone, reschedule or cancel any
previously scheduled special meeting of stockholders (other than, until the
Voting Threshold Date, any such meeting called by holders of a majority of the
voting power of the Corporation), before or after the notice for such meeting
has been sent to the stockholders. Business transacted at any special meeting
of stockholders shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or
purposes stated in the notice of meeting.

 

1.4 Notice of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by law, notice of each
meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not less
than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to
each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. Without
limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given to stockholders,
any notice shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission
consented to (in a manner consistent with the DGCL) by the stockholder to whom
the notice is given. The notices of all meetings shall state the place, if
any, date and time of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any,
by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person
and vote at such meeting, and the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (if such date is different from
the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting). The
notice of a special meeting shall state, in addition, the purpose or purposes
for which the meeting is called. If notice is given by mail, such notice shall
be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
directed to the stockholder at

 



1

    

 such stockholders address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
If notice is given by electronic transmission, such notice shall be deemed
given at the time specified in Section 232 of the DGCL.

1.5 Voting List. The Secretary shall prepare, at least ten (10) days before
every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled
to vote at the meeting ( _provided_ , _however_ , if the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days
before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders
entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open
to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,
for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting: (a) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, _provided_ that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the
meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of
business of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the
list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication,
then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during
the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network,
and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the
notice of the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the list shall
presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at
the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.

 

1.6 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, the holders of a majority in voting power of
the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person, present by means of remote
communication in a manner, if any, authorized by the Board in its sole
discretion, or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business; _provided_ , _however_ , that where a separate vote
by a class or classes or series of capital stock is required by law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority in voting power of
the shares of such class or classes or series of the capital stock of the
Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on such matter,
present in person, present by means of remote communication in a manner, if
any, authorized by the Board in its sole discretion, or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to the vote on
such matter. A quorum, once established at a meeting, shall not be broken by
the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum.

If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the
stockholders, then either (i) the chairperson of the meeting, or (ii) the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented
by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or
represented.

1.7 Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may be
adjourned from time to time to any other time and to any other place at which
a meeting of stockholders may be held under these Bylaws by the chairman of
the meeting or by the 

 



2

    

 stockholders present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote
thereon, although less than a quorum. If the adjournment is for more than
thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to
vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix as the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned
meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of
stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice
of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date
so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. At the adjourned meeting, the
Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the
original meeting.

 

1.8 Voting and Proxies. Each stockholder shall have such number of votes, if
any, for each share of stock entitled to vote and held of record by such
stockholder as may be fixed in the Certificate of Incorporation and a
proportionate vote for each fractional share so held, unless otherwise
provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. Each stockholder of
record entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may vote in person
(including by means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders
may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting) or may
authorize another person or persons to vote for such stockholder by a proxy
executed or transmitted in a manner permitted by applicable law. No such proxy
shall be voted upon after three years from the date of its execution, unless
the proxy expressly provides for a longer period.

 

1.9 Action at Meeting. When a quorum is present at any meeting, any matter
other than the election of directors to be voted upon by the stockholders at
such meeting shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the
votes cast (or if there are two or more classes or series of stock entitled to
vote as separate classes, then in the case of each such class or series,
the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shares of such class
or series), except when a different vote is required by applicable law,
regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, the rules or
regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither abstentions nor broker non-votes will be counted as votes cast for or
against such matter. Other than directors who may be elected by the holders
of shares of any series of Preferred Stock or pursuant to any resolution or
resolutions providing for the issuance of such stock adopted by the Board,
each director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in respect of
the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote on the election of directors. Voting at meetings of
stockholders need not be by written ballot.

 

1.10 Stockholder Action by Written Consent. If stockholders are permitted to
act by written consent pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, in order
that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record
date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date
shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been
fixed by the Board pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 1.10, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting (if stockholders are permitted to act by
written consent pursuant to the 

 



3

    

 Certificate of Incorporation), when no prior action by the Board is required
by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent
setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of
business, or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the
book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no
record date has been fixed by the Board pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 1.10, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting if prior action by the Board
is required by applicable law shall be at the close of business on the date on
which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

 

1.11 Stockholder Action by Written Consent. Until the Voting Threshold Date
and subject to any other restrictions in the Certificate of Incorporation,
any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting
of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent or consents setting forth the action so
taken shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation to its registered
office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an
officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
minutes of proceedings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the
Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate
action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall, to the
extent required by law, be given to those stockholders who have not consented
in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been
entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of
such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient
number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation.

 

1.12 Nomination of Directors.

 

(a) Except for (1) any directors entitled to be elected by the holders of
Preferred Stock, (2) any directors elected in accordance with Section 2.7
hereof by the Board to fill a vacancy or newly-created directorship or (3) as
otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange regulation, at any
meeting of stockholders, only persons who are nominated in accordance with
the procedures in this Section 1.12 shall be eligible for election or re-
election as directors. Nomination for election to the Board at a meeting of
stockholders may be made (i) by or at the direction of the Board (or any
committee thereof) or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who (x)
timely complies with the notice procedures in Section 1.12(b), (y) is a
stockholder of record on the date of the giving of such notice and on the
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting and (z) is entitled to vote at such meeting.

on May 15 of such year); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the
date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than thirty (30) days, or
delayed by more than seventy (70) days, from the first anniversary of the
preceding years annual meeting, a stockholders notice must be so received

the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting and (B) the tenth (10th)

whichever first occurs; or (ii) in the case of an election of directors at a
special meeting of stockholders, _provided_ that the majority of the Board,
the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer has determined, in
accordance with Section 1.3, that directors shall be elected at such special
meeting and _provided_ _further_ that the nomination made by the stockholder
is for one of the director positions that the Board, the Chairman of the Board
or the Chief Executive Officer, as the case may be, has determined will be
filled at such special meeting, not earlier than the one hundred
and twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than
the close of business on the later of (x) the ninetieth (90th) day prior to
such special meeting and (y) the tenth (10th) day following the day on which
notice of the date of such special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of
the date of such special meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event
shall the adjournment or postponement of a meeting (or the public disclosure
thereof) commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the
giving of a stockholders notice.

The stockholders notice to the Secretary shall set forth: (A) as to each
proposed nominee (1) such persons name, age, business address and, if known,

nominee, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or
benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power
of, such proposed nominee with respect to shares of stock of the Corporation,
and (6) any other information

 



5

    

 concerning such person that must be disclosed as to nominees in proxy
solicitations pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); and (B) as to the stockholder giving
the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is
being made (1) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the
Corporations books, of such beneficial owner, and any Stockholder Associated

of electing such nominee(s), (4) a description of any agreement, arrangement
or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, swaps, profit

been entered into by, or on behalf of, such stockholder, such beneficial
owner or any Stockholder Associated Person, the effect or intent of which is
to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or

the Corporation, (5) any other information relating to such stockholder, such
beneficial owner and any Stockholder Associated Person that would be required

connection with solicitations of proxies for the election of directors in a
contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, (6) a representation that such
stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate
the person(s) named in its notice and (7) a representation whether
such stockholder, such beneficial owner and/or such Stockholder Associated
Person intends or is part of a group which intends (x) to deliver a proxy
statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the
Corporations outstanding capital stock reasonably believed by such
stockholder, such beneficial owner or such Stockholder Associated Person to be
sufficient to elect the nominee and/or (y) otherwise to solicit proxies or
votes from stockholders in support of such nomination. Such information
provided and statements made as required by clauses (A) and (B) above or
otherwise by this Section 1.12 are hereinafter referred to as a "Nominee
Solicitation Statement." Not later than ten (10) days after the record date
for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, the
information required by Items (A)(1)-(5) and (B)(1)-(5) of the prior sentence
shall be supplemented by the stockholder giving the notice to provide updated

stockholders notice must be accompanied by the written consent of the
proposed nominee to serve as a director if elected and a written statement
executed by the proposed nominee acknowledging that as a director of the
Corporation, the nominee will owe a fiduciary duty under Delaware law with
respect to the Corporation and its stockholders. The Corporation may require
any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as the Corporation may
reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to
serve as a director of the Corporation or whether such nominee would be
independent under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission and stock
exchange rules and the Corporations publicly disclosed corporate governance
guidelines. A stockholder shall not have complied with this Section

 



6

    

 1.12(b) if the stockholder (or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
nomination is made) solicits or does not solicit, as the case may be, proxies
or votes in support of such stockholders nominee in contravention of the
representations with respect thereto required by this Section 1.12. For
purposes of these Bylaws, a "Stockholder Associated Person" of any stockholder
shall mean (i) any person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in
concert with, such stockholder, (ii) any beneficial owner of shares of stock
of the corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and on
whose behalf the proposal or nomination, as the case may be, is being made,
or (iii) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with
such person referred to in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii).

 

(c) Without exception, no person shall be eligible for election or re-election
as a director of the Corporation at a meeting of stockholders unless
nominated in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 1.12. In
addition, a nominee shall not be eligible for election or re-election if
a stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes action
contrary to the representations made in the Nominee Solicitation Statement
applicable to such nominee or if the Nominee Solicitation Statement applicable
to such nominee contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
The chairman of any meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether
a nomination was made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.12
(including the previous sentence of this Section 1.12(c)), and if the chairman
should determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 1.12, the chairman shall so declare to the meeting
and such nomination shall not be brought before the meeting.

(d) Except as otherwise required by law, nothing in this Section 1.12 shall
obligate the Corporation or the Board to include in any proxy statement or
other stockholder communication distributed on behalf of the Corporation or
the Board information with respect to any nominee for director submitted by a
stockholder.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.12, unless
otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative
of the stockholder) does not appear at the meeting to present a nomination,
such nomination shall not be brought before the meeting, notwithstanding that
proxies in respect of such nominee may have been received by the Corporation.
For purposes of this Section 1.12, to be considered a "qualified
representative of the stockholder", a person must be authorized by a written
instrument executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission
delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the
meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such written instrument
or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the
written instrument or electronic transmission, at the meeting of
stockholders.

(f) For purposes of this Section 1.12, "public disclosure" shall include
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



7

    

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.12, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect
to the matters set forth in this Section 1.12; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any
requirements applicable to nominations to be considered pursuant to this
Section 1.12 (including paragraph (a)(ii) hereof), and compliance with
paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 1.12 shall be the exclusive means for a
stockholder to make nominations. Nothing in this Section 1.12 shall be deemed
to affect any rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect
directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation.

the information required by Items (A)(3) and (B)(1)-(6) of the prior sentence
shall be supplemented by the stockholder giving the notice to provide updated

to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting of
stockholders except in accordance with the procedures in this Section 1.13;.
A stockholder shall not have complied with this Section 1.13(b) if the
stockholder (or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is
made) solicits or does not solicit, as the case may be, proxies or votes in
support of such stockholders proposal in contravention of the representations
with respect thereto required by this Section 1.13.

 



9

    

(c) Without exception, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting
except in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 1.13. In
addition, business proposed to be brought by a stockholder may not be brought
before the annual meeting if such stockholder or a Stockholder Associated
Person, as applicable, takes action contrary to the representations made in
the Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business or if the
Business Solicitation Statement applicable to such business contains an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading. The chairman of any annual meeting
shall have the power and duty to determine whether business was properly
brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 1.13 (including the previous sentence of this Section 1.13(c)), and if
the chairman should determine that business was not properly brought before
the annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.13,
the chairman shall so declare to the meeting and such business shall not be
brought before the annual meeting.

(d) Except as otherwise required by law, nothing in this Section 1.13 shall
obligate the Corporation or the Board to include in any proxy statement or
other stockholder communication distributed on behalf of the Corporation or
the Board information with respect to any proposal submitted by a
stockholder.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.13,
unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified
representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual meeting to
present business, such business shall not be considered, notwithstanding that
proxies in respect of such business may have been received by the
Corporation.

(f) For purposes of this Section 1.13, the terms "qualified representative of
the stockholder" and "public disclosure" shall have the same meaning as in
Section 1.2.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.13, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section 1.13; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any
requirements applicable to proposals as to any business to be considered

reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such
chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules,
regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the

present, ready and willing to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman
of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting.
Unless otherwise required by law, inspectors may be officers, employees or
agents of the Corporation. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge
of such inspectors duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to
execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the
best of such inspectors ability. The inspector shall have the duties
prescribed by law and, when the vote is completed, shall make a certificate of

Directors

2.1 General Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
managed by or under the direction of a Board, who may exercise all of the
powers of the Corporation except as otherwise provided by law or the
Certificate of Incorporation.

 

2.2 Number, Election and Qualification. Subject to the rights of holders of
any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors, the number of directors of
the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by the Board. Election of
directors need not be by written ballot. Directors need not be stockholders of
the Corporation. Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate
of Incorporation and subject to the special rights of holders of any series
of Preferred Stock to elect directors, immediately following the Voting
Threshold Date, the Board shall be divided into three classes, designated as
Class I, Class II and Class III. The number of directors in each class shall
be divided as nearly equally as is practicable.

2.3 Chairman of the Board; Vice Chairman of the Board. The Board may appoint
from its members a Chairman of the Board and a Vice Chairman of the Board,
neither of whom need be an employee or officer of the Corporation. If the
Board appoints a Chairman of the Board, such Chairman shall perform such
duties and possess such powers as are assigned by the Board and, if the
Chairman of the Board is also designated as the Corporations Chief Executive
Officer, shall have the powers and duties of the Chief Executive Officer
prescribed in Section 3.7 of these Bylaws. If the Board appoints a Vice
Chairman of the Board, such Vice Chairman shall perform such duties and
possess such powers as are assigned by the Board. Unless otherwise provided by
the Board, the Chairman of the Board or, in the Chairmans absence, the Vice
Chairman of the Board, if any, shall preside at all meetings of the Board.

 

2.4 Quorum. A majority of the total number of directors shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business. If at any meeting of the Board there
shall be less than a quorum, a majority of the directors present may adjourn
the meeting from time to time without further notice other than announcement
at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. A meeting at which a quorum
is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the
withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a
majority of the required quorum for that meeting.

 

2.5 Action at Meeting. Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the
directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present shall
be regarded as the act of the Board, unless a greater number is required by
law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

 

2.6 Removal. Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred
Stock, directors of the Corporation may be removed only as expressly provided
in the Certificate of Incorporation.

2.7 Vacancies. Subject to the rights of holders of any series of
Preferred Stock, any newly created directorship that results from an increase
in the number of directors or any

 



12

    

 vacancy on the Board that results from the death, disability, resignation,
disqualification or removal of any director or from any other cause shall be
filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of
directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director and shall not be filled by the stockholders. Any director elected to
fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors
shall hold office for the remaining term of his or her predecessor.

2.8 Resignation. Any director may resign only by delivering a resignation in
writing or by electronic transmission to the Chairman of the Board or the
Chief Executive Officer. Such resignation shall be effective upon delivery
unless it is specified to be effective at some later time or upon
the happening of some later event.

2.9 Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board may be held without notice
at such time and place as shall be determined from time to time by the Board;
_provided_ that any director who is absent when such a determination is made
shall be given notice of the determination. A regular meeting of the Board may
be held without notice immediately after and at the same place as the annual
meeting of stockholders.

2.10 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board may be held at any time
and place designated in a call by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief
Executive Officer, the President, two or more directors, or by one director in
the event that there is only a single director in office.

 

2.11 Notice of Special Meetings. Notice of the date, place and time of any
special meeting of the Board shall be given to each director by the Chairman
of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Secretary or by the officer or
one of the directors calling the meeting. Notice shall be duly given to each
director (a) in person or by telephone at least twenty-four (24) hours in
advance of the meeting, (b) by sending written notice by reputable overnight
courier, telecopy, facsimile or other means of electronic transmission, or
delivering written notice by hand, to such directors last known business,
home or means of electronic transmission address at least twenty-four (24)
hours in advance of the meeting, or (c) by sending written notice by first-
class mail to such directors last known business or home address at
least seventy-two (72) hours in advance of the meeting. A notice or waiver of
notice of a meeting of the Board need not specify the purposes of the meeting.

 

2.12 Meetings by Conference Communications Equipment. Directors may
participate in meetings of the Board or any committee thereof by means of
conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation by
such means shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

 

2.13 Action by Consent. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any
meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof may be taken without a
meeting, if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent
to the action in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or
writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the
minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee thereof. Such filing shall
be in paper

 



13

    

 form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic
form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.

 

2.14 Committees. The Board may designate one or more committees, each
committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation with
such lawfully delegable powers and duties as the Board thereby confers, to
serve at the pleasure of the Board. The Board may designate one or more
directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent
or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or
disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members of the
committee present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or
not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint
another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of any such
absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in
the resolution of the Board and subject to the provisions of law, shall have
and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the management
of the business and affairs of the Corporation and may authorize the seal of
the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such
committee shall have the power or authority to (i) approve or adopt, or
recommend to the stockholders, any action or matter (other than the election
or removal of directors) expressly required by the DGCL to be submitted
to stockholders for approval, or (ii) adopt, amend or repeal any bylaw of the
Corporation. Each such committee shall keep minutes and make such reports as
the Board may from time to time request. Except as the Board may otherwise
determine, any committee may make rules for the conduct of its business, but
unless otherwise provided by the directors or in such rules, its business
shall be conducted as nearly as possible in the same manner as is provided in
these Bylaws for the Board. Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate
of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or the resolution of the Board designating the
committee, a committee may create one or more subcommittees, each subcommittee
to consist of one or more members of the committee, and delegate to a
subcommittee any or all of the powers and authority of the committee.

2.15 Compensation of Directors. Directors may be paid such compensation for
their services and such reimbursement for expenses of attendance at meetings
as the Board may from time to time determine. No such payment shall preclude
any director from serving the Corporation or any of its parent or subsidiary
entities in any other capacity and receiving compensation for such service.

shares of the authorized capital stock of the Corporation held in the

of by vote of the Board in such manner, for such lawful consideration and on
such terms as the Board may determine.

 



16

    

4.2 Uncertificated Shares; Stock Certificates. The shares of the Corporation
shall not be represented by certificates, _provided_ that the Board may
provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or
series of the Corporations stock shall be certificated shares. Any such
resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such
certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Each such certificate shall be
signed in a manner that complies with Section 158 of the DGCL. Such signatures
may be facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has
signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed on such certificate shall
have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the

written assignment or power of attorney properly executed, and with such
proof of authority or the authenticity of signature as the Corporation or its
transfer agent may reasonably require. Except as may be otherwise required by
law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, the Corporation
shall be entitled to treat the record holder of stock as shown on its books as
the owner of such stock for all purposes, including the payment of dividends
and the right to vote with respect to such stock, regardless of any transfer,
pledge or other disposition of such stock until the shares have been
transferred on the books of the Corporation in accordance with the
requirements of these Bylaws.

 

4.4 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. The Corporation may issue a new

which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than
sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the
Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board
determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or
before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such
determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of 

 



17

    

 business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board may
fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at
the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for
stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an
earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote
in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board may fix a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days
prior to such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating
thereto.

for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice required
to be given to such person. Neither the business nor the purpose of any
meeting need be specified in any such waiver. Attendance of a person at a
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the
person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning
of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened.

of the Corporation, and act as, or appoint any person or persons to act as,
proxy or attorney-in-fact for this Corporation (with or without power of
substitution) with respect to, the securities of any other entity which may be
held by this Corporation.

 

5.5 Evidence of Authority. A certificate by the Secretary, or an Assistant
Secretary, or a temporary Secretary, as to any action taken by the
stockholders, directors, a committee or any officer or representative of the
Corporation shall as to all persons who rely on the certificate in good faith
be conclusive evidence of such action.

Certificate of Incorporation shall be deemed to refer to the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended and/or restated and in effect
from time to time.

directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated
process.

Article VII

 

Indemnification and Advancement

 

7.1 Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings other than Those by or
in the Right of the Corporation. Subject to Section 7.3, the Corporation
shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the
fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or,
while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee

 



19

    

 or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea or nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not,
of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and
in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such persons
conduct was unlawful.

7.2 Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of
the Corporation. Subject to Section 7.3, the Corporation shall indemnify, to
the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in
the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of
the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation,
or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that
the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability
but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery
or such other court shall deem proper.

 

7.3 Authorization of Indemnification. Any indemnification under this Article
VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of
the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 7.1 or Section
7.2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a
person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by
a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit
or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such
directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less
than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors
so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the
stockholders. Such determination shall be made, with respect to former
directors and officer, by any person or persons having the authority to act on
the matter on behalf of the Corporation. To the extent, however, that a
present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful
on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding set
forth in Section 7.1 or 

 



20

    

 Section 7.2 or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person
shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the
necessity of authorization in the specific case.

7.4 Good Faith Defined. For purposes of any determination under Section 7.3,
a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such
person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to
have had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful, if
such persons action is based on good faith reliance on the records or books
of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information
supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another
enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel
for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given
or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent
certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with
reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another
enterprise" as used in this Section 7.4 shall mean any other corporation or
any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this
Section 7.4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the
circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.2, as the case may be.

7.5 Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. Notwithstanding any contrary
determination in the specific case under Section 7.3, and notwithstanding the
absence of any determination thereunder, if a claim under Sections 7.1 or 7.2
of the Article VII is not paid in full by the Corporation within (i) ninety
(90) days after a written claim for indemnification has been received by the
Corporation, or (ii) thirty (30) days after a written claim for an advancement
of expenses has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time
thereafter (but not before) bring suit against the Corporation in the Court
of Chancery in the State of Delaware to recover the unpaid amount of the
claim, together with interest thereon, or to obtain advancement of expenses,
as applicable. It shall be a defense to any such action brought to enforce a
right to indemnification (but not in an action brought to enforce a right to
an advancement of expenses) that the claimant has not met the standards of
conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL (or other applicable
law) for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed,
but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither a
contrary determination in the specific case under Section 7.3 nor the absence
of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met any applicable standard of
conduct. If successful, in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be
entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim, including
reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection therewith, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law.

 

7.6 Expenses Payable in Advance. Expenses, including without limitation
attorneys fees, incurred by a current or former director or officer in
defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or
proceeding shall be paid, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law as
the same exists or may hereafter be amended, by the Corporation in advance
of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of
an undertaking by or on behalf of such current or former director or officer
to repay such amount

 



21

    

 if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VII.

 

7.7 Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. The rights
to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted
pursuant to this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, any agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that, subject
to Section 7.11, indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 7.1 and
7.2 shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of
this Article VII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any
person who is not specified in Section 7.1 or 7.2 but whom the Corporation
has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or
otherwise.

 

7.8 Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf
of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any
such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not
the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such
person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VII.

7.9 Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Article VII, references to
"the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation,
any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent)
absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had
continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors,
officers, employees or agents so that any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same
position under the provisions of this Article VII with respect to
the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect
to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For
purposes of this Article VII, references to "director" or "officer"
shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, any person who has served as a
director or officer of Oaktree Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted
company. For purposes of this Article VII, references to "fines" shall include
any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect of any employee benefit
plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall
include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director,
officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its
participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation"
as referred to in this Article VII.

 



22

    

7.10 Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant
to, this Article VII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer
and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such a person.

7.11 Limitation on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Article VII to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights
to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 7.5), the Corporation
shall not be obligated to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent
in connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof):

(a) for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of such person
under any statute, insurance policy, indemnity provision, vote or otherwise,
except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid;

(b) for an accounting or disgorgement of profits pursuant to Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act, or similar provisions of federal, state or local statutory
law or common law, if such person is held liable therefor (including pursuant
to any settlement arrangements);

(c) for any reimbursement of the Corporation by such person of any bonus or
other incentive-based or equity-based compensation or of any profits realized
by such person from the sale of securities of the corporation, as required in
each case under the Exchange Act (including any such reimbursements that arise
from an accounting restatement of the Corporation pursuant to Section 304 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), or the payment to
the Corporation of profits arising from the purchase and sale by such person
of securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), if such
person is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement
arrangements);

(d) initiated by such person, including any action, suit or proceeding (or
part thereof) initiated by such person against the Corporation or its
directors, officers, employees, agents or other indemnitees, unless (i) the
Board authorized the action, suit or proceeding (or relevant part thereof)
prior to its initiation, (ii) the Corporation provides the indemnification, in
its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Corporation under
applicable law, (iii) otherwise required to be made under Section 7.5 or (iv)
otherwise required by applicable law; or

(e) if prohibited by applicable law.

 

7.12 Contract Rights. The obligations of the Corporation under this Article
VII to indemnify, and advance expenses to, a person who is or was a director
or officer of the Corporation shall be considered a contract between the
Corporation and such person, and no modification or repeal of any provision of
this Article VII shall affect, to the detriment of such person,
such obligations of the Corporation in connection with a claim based on any
act or failure to act occurring before such modification or repeal.

class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) members of the Board at each meeting
or pursuant to each consent of the Companys stockholders for the election of
directors, and to remove from office such directors in accordance with
applicable law and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or
removal of such directors.

 

(ii) For so long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding,
the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be
entitled to elect one (1) member of the Board (the " _Series B Director_ ") at
each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Companys stockholders for the
election of directors, and to remove from office such director in accordance
with applicable law and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death
or removal of such directors.

 

(iii) The holders of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an
as-if-converted basis, shall be entitled to elect one (1) member of the Board
(the " _Preferred Director_ ") at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of
the Companys stockholders for the election of directors, and to remove from
office such directors in accordance with applicable law and to fill any
vacancy caused by the resignation, death or removal of such directors.

 

(iv) The holders of Preferred Stock, Class A Common, Class F Common, and Class
V Common voting together as a single class on an as-if-converted basis, shall
be entitled to elect all remaining members of the Board at each meeting or
pursuant to each consent of the Companys stockholders for the election of
directors, and to remove from office such directors in accordance with
applicable law and to fill any vacancy caused by the resignation, death or
removal of such directors.

 

(v) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and 223(a)(2) of the
DGCL, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors, and vacancies created by
removal or resignation of a director, may be filled by a majority of the
directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual
election and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless
sooner displaced; provided, however, that where such vacancy occurs among
the directors elected by the holders of a class or series of stock, the
holders of shares of such class or series may override the Boards action to
fill such vacancy by (A) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at
a meeting of the Companys stockholders or (B) written consent, if the
consenting stockholders hold a sufficient number of shares to elect their
designee at a meeting of the stockholders in which all members of such class
or series are present and voted. Any director may be removed during his or
her term of office without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the

 



9

    

 holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such
director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders
duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of
stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the holders of
that class or series of stock represented at the meeting or pursuant to
written consent. At any meeting held for the purpose of electing a director,
the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of the class or series entitled to elect such director
shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing such director.

 

(vi) No person entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate
votes to which such person is entitled unless required by applicable law at
the time of such election. During such time or times that applicable law
requires cumulative voting, every stockholder entitled to vote at an election
for directors may cumulate such stockholders votes and give one candidate a
number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by
the number of votes to which such stockholders shares are otherwise entitled,
or distribute the stockholders votes on the same principle among as
many candidates as such stockholder desires. No stockholder, however, shall
be entitled to so cumulate such stockholders votes unless (A) the names of
such candidate or candidates have been placed in nomination prior to the
voting and (B) the stockholder has given notice at the meeting, prior to the
voting, of such stockholders intention to cumulate such stockholders votes.
If any stockholder has given proper notice to cumulate votes, all stockholders
may cumulate their votes for any candidates who have been properly placed in
nomination. Under cumulative voting, the candidates receiving the highest
number of votes, up to the number of directors to be elected, are elected.

 

4\. LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.

 

a. Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, whether
voluntary or involuntary (a " _Liquidation Event_ "), before any distribution
or payment shall be made to the holders of any Common Stock, the holders of

greater per share liquidation payment if converted into Class A Common than
if remaining Preferred Stock, (e) with respect to the Series B Preferred
Stock, the greater of (i) the Series B Original Issue Price plus all declared
and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock and (ii) such amount per

unpaid dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and (ii) such amount per
share as would have been payable had all shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock
been converted into Class A Common pursuant to Section 5 immediately prior to
such Liquidation Event assuming the conversion into Class A Common of all
shares of each series of Preferred Stock that would receive a greater per

share liquidation payment if converted into Class A Common than if remaining
Preferred Stock. If, upon any such Liquidation Event, the assets of the
Company shall be insufficient to make payment in full to all holders of
Preferred Stock of the liquidation preference set forth in this Section 4(a),
then such assets (or consideration) shall be distributed among the holders of
Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full
amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. 

b. After the payment of the full liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock
as set forth in Section 4(a) above, the remaining assets of the Company
legally available for distribution (or the consideration received by the
Company or its stockholders in an Acquisition), if any, shall be distributed
ratably to the holders of the Common Stock.

 



11

    

c. An Asset Transfer or Acquisition (each as defined below) shall be deemed
a Liquidation Event for purposes of this Section 4\.

(i) For the purposes of this Section 4: (i) " _Acquisition_ " shall mean (A)
any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation
or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, other than
any such consolidation, merger or reorganization in which the shares of
capital stock of the Company immediately prior to such consolidation, merger
or reorganization, continue to represent a majority of the voting power of the
surviving entity (or, if the surviving entity is a wholly owned subsidiary,
its parent) immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization
(provided that, for the purpose of this Section 4(c), all shares of Class A
Common issuable upon exercise of options outstanding immediately prior to
such consolidation or merger or upon conversion of any other stock, options,
warrants, purchase rights or other securities exercisable for or convertible
into Class A Common outstanding immediately prior to such merger
or consolidation shall be deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such
merger or consolidation and, if applicable, converted or exchanged in such
merger or consolidation on the same terms as the actual outstanding shares of
capital stock are converted or exchanged) or (B) the closing of the transfer
(whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons
(other than an underwriter of the Companys securities), of the Companys
securities if, after such closing, such person or group of affiliated persons
would hold 50% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the Company (or the
surviving or acquiring entity); provided that an Acquisition shall not
include any transaction or series of transactions principally for bona fide
equity financing purposes in which cash is received by the Company or any
successor or indebtedness of the Company is cancelled or converted or a
combination thereof; and (ii) " _Asset Transfer_ " shall mean a sale, lease,
exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company in one transaction or a series of related transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the approval, adoption,
filing, consummation and/or implementation of the AandR Dual Class Company
Charter, the Dual Class Structure, the Company Recapitalization (each
as defined in the Merger Agreement) or pursuant to any related exchange
agreement as contemplated in the Merger Agreement shall not be deemed to be a
Liquidation Event, a deemed Liquidation Event or an Acquisition or Asset
Transfer hereunder.

 

(ii) In any Acquisition or Asset Transfer, if the consideration to be received
is in the form of securities of an entity or other property other than cash,
its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined in good faith by
the Board on the date such determination is made.

 

d. The Company shall not have the power to effect any Liquidation Event unless
the plan of liquidation or definitive agreement for such transaction (the "
_Agreement_ ") provides that the consideration payable to the stockholders of
the Company in connection therewith shall be allocated among the holders of
capital stock of the Company in accordance with this Section 4\. In the event
of an Acquisition or Asset Transfer, if any portion of the consideration
payable to the stockholders of the Company is placed into escrow and/or is
payable to the stockholders of the Company subject to contingencies, then the
Agreement shall provide that (i) the portion of such consideration that is not
placed in escrow and not subject to any contingencies (the " _Initial
Consideration_ ") shall be allocated among the holders of capital 

 



12

    

 stock of the Company in accordance with this Section 4 as if the Initial
Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection with such
Liquidation Event and (ii) any additional consideration that becomes payable
to the stockholders of the Company upon release from escrow or satisfaction of
contingencies shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the
Company in accordance with this Section 4 after taking into account the
previous payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same transaction.

5. CONVERSION AND TRANSFER RIGHTS. The holders of each of the Class F Common
and Preferred Stock (together, the " _Convertible Stock_ ") and the Class V
Common Stock shall have the following rights with respect to the conversion of
Convertible Stock and Class V Common Stock into shares of Class A Common:

 

a. Class F Common.

 

(i) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of
this Section 5, any shares of Class F Common may, at the option of the
holder, be converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of
Class A Common. The number of shares of Class A Common to which a holder of
Class F Common shall be entitled upon conversion shall be the product
obtained by multiplying the Class F Common Conversion Rate then in effect
(determined as provided in Section 5(a)(ii)) by the number of shares of Class
F Common being converted.

 

(ii) Class F Common Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect at any time
for conversion of the Class F Common (the " _Class_ __ _ F Common Conversion
Rate_") shall be the quotient obtained by dividing $0.000001 (the " _Class_ __
_ F Original Issue Price_") by the Class F Common Conversion Price,
calculated as provided in Section 5(a)(iii).

(iii) Class F Common Conversion Price. The conversion price for the Class F
Common shall initially be the Class F Original Issue Price (the " _Class_ __ _
F Common Conversion Price_"). Such initial Class F Common Conversion Price
shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 5\. All
references to the Class F Common Conversion Price herein shall mean the Class
F Common Conversion Price as so adjusted.

 

b. _Issuance of Class_ __ _ V Common Stock_. Shares of Class V Common Stock
may be issued only to, and registered in the name of, (i) Andrew Dudum (the "
_ _Founder__ ") and/or (ii) any Permitted Class V Owner.

 

c. _Mandatory Conversion of Class_ __ _ V Common Stock_.

 

(i) All shares of Class V Common Stock shall (1) automatically and without
further action on the part of the Company or any holder of Class V Common
Stock be converted into an equal number of fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Class A Common Stock upon any Transfer of such shares of Class V Common
Stock, except for a Permitted Transfer; and (2) be subject to conversion into
an equal number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class A Common Stock
upon adoption of a resolution by the Board at any time on or after the one-
year anniversary of the date (the " _Founder Termination Anniversary Date_ ")
that both of the following conditions (the " _Trigger Conditions_ ") are
satisfied:

 



13

    

(a) the earliest to occur of (A) the Founders employment as Chief Executive
Officer being terminated for Cause or due to death or Permanent Disability and
(B) the Founder resigns (other than for Good Reason) as the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company; and

 

(b) either (A) the Founder no longer serves as a member of the Board or (B)
the Founder serves as a member of the Board, but his service to the Company
is not his primary business occupation;

_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Founder is reinstated as the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company or is reelected or appointed to serve as a
member of the Board prior to the Founder Termination Anniversary Date (each a
" _Reset Event_ "), then the shares of Class V Common Stock may not be
converted pursuant to clause (2) of Section 5.c(i) of this Article IV unless
and until the one-year anniversary of the date that both Trigger Conditions
are subsequently met (such date, the " _Next Founder Termination Anniversary
Date_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event of a subsequent Reset
Event, the Next Founder Termination Anniversary Date will extend until the
one-year anniversary of the date that both Trigger Conditions are subsequently
met without a Reset Event occurring prior to such anniversary. Upon a Transfer
of Class V Common Stock upon divorce by settlement, order or decree, or as
required by a domestic relations settlement, order or decree, then any shares
of Class V Common Stock Transferred thereby shall automatically and without
further action on the part of the Company or any holder of Class V Common
Stock be converted into an equal number of fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Class A Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that any other outstanding
shares of Class V Common Stock not so Transferred shall not be automatically
converted into Class A Common Stock and shall remain outstanding irrespective
of such automatic conversion and such Transfer in accordance with the terms
hereof.

 

(ii) Each outstanding stock certificate that, immediately prior to such
conversion, represented one or more shares of Class V Common Stock subject to
such conversion will, upon such conversion, be deemed to represent an equal
number of shares of Class A Common Stock, without the need for surrender or
exchange thereof. The Company will, upon the request of any holder whose
shares of Class V Common Stock have been converted into shares of Class A
Common Stock as a result of such conversion and upon surrender by such holder
to the Company of the outstanding certificate(s) formerly representing
such holders shares of Class V Common Stock (if any), issue and deliver to
such holder certificate(s) representing the shares of Class A Common Stock
into which such holders shares of Class V Common Stock were converted as
a result of such conversion (if such shares are certificated) or, if such
shares are uncertificated or the stockholder otherwise consents, register such
shares in book-entry form.

 

(iii) Following any such conversion, the reissuance of shares of Class V
Common Stock shall be prohibited, and such shares of Class V Common Stock
will be retired by the Company and cancelled in accordance with the DGCL and
the filing with the Delaware Secretary of State required thereby. Upon such
retirement and filing, all references herein to Class A Common Stock will be
deemed to be references to Common Stock. Each outstanding stock certificate
that, immediately prior to such retirement and filing, represented one or more
shares of Class A Common Stock will, following such retirement and filing, be

 



14

    

 deemed to represent an equal number of shares Common Stock, without the need
for surrender or exchange thereof.

 

(iv) If the Company has reason to believe that a Transfer giving rise to a
conversion of shares of Class V Common Stock into Class A Common Stock has
occurred but has not theretofore been reflected on the books of the Company,
the Company may request that the holder of such shares furnish affidavits or
other evidence to the Company as the Company deems necessary to determine
whether a conversion of shares of Class V Common Stock to Class A Common Stock
has occurred, and if such holder does not within twenty-five (25) days after
the date of such request furnish sufficient evidence to the Company (in the
manner provided in the request) to enable the Company to determine that no
such conversion has occurred, any such shares of Class V Common Stock, to the
extent not previously converted, shall be automatically converted into shares
of Class A Common Stock as of the date of the transfer in question and the
same will thereupon be registered on the books, records and stock ledger of
the Company. In connection with any action of stockholders taken at a meeting
or by written consent (if action by written consent of the stockholders is
not prohibited at such time under this Restated Certificate of Incorporation),
the stock ledger of the Company shall be presumptive evidence as to who are
the stockholders entitled to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of
stockholders and the class or classes or series of shares held by each such
stockholder and the number of shares of each class or classes or series held
by such stockholder.

 

(v) Definitions. For purposes of this Article IV of this Restated Certificate
of Incorporation,

 

(a) " _Cause_ " means (i) an unauthorized use or disclosure by the Founder of
the Companys or any of its subsidiaries confidential information or trade
secrets, which use or disclosure causes material harm to the Company or any

receiving written notification of such failure from the Board; or (vii) a
failure by the Founder to cooperate in good faith with a governmental or
internal investigation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their
respective directors, officers or employees, if the Company has requested the
Founders cooperation. A condition shall not be considered "Cause" unless the
Company gives the Founder written notice of such condition within 90 days
after such condition becomes known to the Board and the Founder fails to
remedy such condition within 30 days after receiving the Companys written
notice3.

 

(b) " _Good Reason_ " means the occurrence of any of the following events,
without the express written consent of the Founder: (i) a reduction in the
Founders base salary by more than 10% (other than across-the-board reductions
affecting similarly situated senior executives of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries); (ii) a material diminution of the Founders authority, duties
or responsibilities; or (iii) a relocation of the Founders principal

existing agreement. Each of Cause, Good Reason and Permanent Disability
should be updated to reflect the terms of any updated employment agreement to
be entered into concurrently with the Closing. 

---|--- 
 



15

    

 90 days after such condition comes into existence and the Company fails to
remedy such condition within 30 days after receiving the Founders written
notice.

 

(c) " _Permanent Disability_ " means a permanent and total disability such
that the Founder is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by
reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which would
reasonably be expected to result in death within twelve (12) months or which
has lasted or would reasonably be expected to last for a continuous period of
not less than twelve (12) months as determined by a licensed medical
practitioner.

(d) " _Permitted Class_ __ _ V Owner_" means any corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, foundation or similar entity wholly-owned
(directly or indirectly) by the Founder (including all subsequent successors
and assigns), or any trust for the benefit of the Founder, or of which the
Founder is a trustee or has sole or shared voting power such that the Founder
has Voting Control over the shares held therein; provided that, in each case,
the Founder has sole dispositive power and the exclusive right to direct the
voting of all of the shares of Class V Common Stock held by such entity and
the Transfer to the transferee does not involve any payment of
cash, securities, property or other consideration (other than an interest in
such entity) to the Founder.

(e) " _Permitted Transfer_ " means any Transfer of a share of Class V Common
Stock:

(i) by the Founder to a Permitted Class V Owner; or

(ii) by a Permitted Class V Owner to the Founder or any other Permitted Class

of law (including by merger, consolidation or otherwise), including, without
limitation, a transfer of a share of Class V Common Stock to a broker or other
nominee (regardless of whether there is a corresponding change in beneficial
ownership), or the transfer of, or entering into a binding agreement with
respect to, Voting Control over such share by proxy or otherwise (other than
proxy(ies), voting instruction(s) or voting agreement(s) solicited on
behalf of the Board). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the pledge of shares of
Class V Common Stock by a stockholder that creates a mere security interest in
such shares pursuant to a bona fide loan or indebtedness transaction for so
long as such stockholder continues to exercise Voting Control over such
pledged shares shall not be considered a "Transfer" within the meaning of this
Article IV; provided, however, that a foreclosure on such shares or other
similar action by the pledgee shall constitute a "Transfer" unless such
foreclosure or similar action independently qualifies as a "Permitted
Transfer" at such time. A "Transfer" shall also be deemed to have occurred
with respect to a share of Class V Common Stock beneficially held by the
transferor, if there occurs any act or circumstance that causes such transfer
to not be a Permitted Transfer.

 



16

    

(g) " _Voting Control_ " with respect to a share of Class V Common Stock
means the power (whether exclusive or shared) to vote or direct the voting of
such share of Class V Common Stock by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise.

 

d. Preferred Stock.

 

(i) Optional Conversion. Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of
this Section 5, any shares of Preferred Stock may, at the option of the
holder, be converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of
Class A Common. The number of shares of Class A Common to which a holder of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled upon conversion shall be the product
obtained by multiplying the Preferred Stock Conversion Rate then in effect
(determined as provided in Section 5(b)(ii)) by the number of shares of
Preferred Stock being converted.

 

(ii) Preferred Stock Conversion Rate. The conversion rate in effect at any
time for conversion of the Preferred Stock (the " _Preferred Stock Conversion
Rate_ " and, each of the Preferred Stock Conversion Rate and the Class F
Common Conversion Rate, a " _Conversion Rate_ ") shall be the quotient
obtained by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price by the Preferred
Stock Conversion Price, calculated as provided in Section 5(b)(iii).

(iii) Preferred Stock Conversion Price. The conversion price for the
Preferred Stock shall initially be the applicable Original Issue Price (the "
_Preferred Stock Conversion Price_ " and, each of the Preferred Stock
Conversion Price and the Class F Common Conversion Price, a " _Conversion
Price_ "). Such initial Preferred Stock Conversion Price shall be adjusted
from time to time in accordance with this Section 5\. All references to
the Preferred Stock Conversion Price herein shall mean the Preferred Stock
Conversion Price as so adjusted.

e. Mechanics of Optional Conversion. Each holder of Convertible Stock who
desires to convert the same into shares of Class A Common pursuant to this
Section 5 shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly
endorsed, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Convertible Stock and shall give written notice to the Company at such office
that such holder elects to convert the same. Such notice shall state the
number of shares of each class of Convertible Stock being converted.
Thereupon, the Company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such
holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Class A
Common to which such holder is entitled. Such conversion shall be deemed
to have been made at the close of business on the date of such surrender of
the certificates representing the shares of Convertible Stock to be converted,
and the person entitled to receive the shares of Class A Common issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of
such shares of Class A Common on such date.

f. Conversion Price Adjustments of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series
B-2 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock for
Certain Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of
the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, respectively, shall be subject
to adjustment from time to time as follows:

 



17

    

(i) If the Company shall issue, on or after the date upon which this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Filing Date_ "), any Additional
Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per
share that is less than the Conversion Price applicable to the Series A
Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series
B-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock
and/or Series D Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of
such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock,
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred
Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock Series C Preferred Stock and/or Series D
Preferred Stock, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to each such
issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be
adjusted to a price (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth of a cent)
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator
of which shall be the number of shares of Class A Common Outstanding (as
defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares
of Class A Common that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for
such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares of Class A Common Outstanding immediately
prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. For
purposes of this Section 5(d)(i), the term " _Common Stock Outstanding_ "
shall mean and include the following: (1) outstanding Class A Common, (2)
Class A Common issuable upon conversion of outstanding Class F Common and
Preferred Stock, (3) Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock
options and (4) Common Stock issuable upon exercise (and, in the case of
warrants to purchase Preferred Stock, conversion) of outstanding warrants.
Shares described in (1) through (4) above shall be included whether vested or
unvested, whether contingent or non-contingent and whether exercisable or not
yet exercisable. In the event that the Company issues or sells, or is deemed
to have issued or sold, shares of Additional Stock that results in
an adjustment to a Conversion Price pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 5(d) (the " _First Dilutive Issuance_ "), and the Company then issues
or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold, shares of Additional Stock
in one or more subsequent issuances other than the First Dilutive Issuance
that would result in further adjustment to a Conversion Price (each, a "
_Subsequent Dilutive Issuance_ ") pursuant to the same instruments as the
First Dilutive Issuance, then, and in each such case upon a Subsequent
Dilutive Issuance, the applicable Conversion Price for each series of
Preferred Stock shall be reduced to the applicable Conversion Price that would
have been in effect had the First Dilutive Issuance and each Subsequent
Dilutive Issuance all occurred on the closing date of the First Dilutive
Issuance.

(a) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be
made in an amount less than one-tenth of one cent ($0.001) per share. Except
to the limited extent provided for in subsections 5(d)(i)(d)(iii) and
5(d)(i)(d)(iv), no adjustment of such Conversion Price pursuant to this
subsection 5(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price
above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

 

(b) In the case of the issuance of Additional Stock for cash, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before
deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed,
paid or incurred by the Company for any underwriting or otherwise in
connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

 



18

    

(c) In the case of the issuance of the Additional Stock for a consideration in
whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the
Board irrespective of any accounting treatment.

 

(d) In the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights to subscribe
for Common Stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable
for Common Stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such
convertible or exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply
for purposes of determining the number of shares of Additional Stock issued
and the consideration paid therefor:

(i) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or
rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at
the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to
the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections 5(d)(i)(c)
and 5(d)(i)(d)), if any, received by the Company upon the issuance of such
options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided for in such options
or rights (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for
the Common Stock covered thereby.

 

(ii) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion of, or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage
of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments)
for, any such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise
of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be
deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such
options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the
consideration, if any, received by the Company for any such securities and
related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued
interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by the Company (without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities
or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each
case to be determined in the manner provided in subsections 5(d)(i)(c) and
5(d)(i)(d)).

(iii) In the event of any change in the number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Company upon exercise of
such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such
convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price of the Series A
Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series
B-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock Series C Preferred Stock
and/or Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, to the extent in any way
affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made
for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration
upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange
of such securities.

 



19

    

(iv) Upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the termination of any
such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights
related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price
of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock Series
C Preferred Stock and/or Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, to the
extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or
securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of Common
Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect)
actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the
conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options
or rights related to such securities.

 

(v) The number of shares of Additional Stock deemed issued and the
consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Subsections 5(d)(i)(d)(i) and
(ii) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or
expiration of the type described in either Subsection 5(d)(i)(d)(iii) or (iv).

 

(ii) " _Additional Stock_ " shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Subsection 5(d)(i)(d)) by the Company
on or after the Filing Date other than:

(a) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described in Subsection
5(d)(i)(d)(iii) hereof.

(b) Common Stock issued to employees, directors, consultants and other
service providers for the primary purpose of soliciting or retaining their
services pursuant to plans or agreements approved by the Board.

or exercisable securities outstanding on the Filing Date. 

(e) Common Stock issued in connection with a bona fide business acquisition by
the Company, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets, sale or
exchange of stock or otherwise; provided that such issuances are approved by
the Board.

(f) Common Stock issued or deemed issued pursuant to Subsection 5(d)(i)(d) as
a result of a decrease in the Conversion Price of Class F Common or Preferred
Stock resulting from the operation of Sections 5(e), 5(f) and 5(g).

 

(g) Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Class F Common or Preferred
Stock.

 

(h) Common Stock issued pursuant to any equipment leasing arrangement or debt
financing arrangement with a commercial bank or nationally

 



20

    

 recognized institutional debt lender, which arrangement is approved by the
Board and is primarily for non-equity financing purposes.

 

(i) Class V Common Stock issued or exchanged pursuant to the consummation or
implementation of the Dual Class Structure and the Company Recapitalization
(each as defined in that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among
Oaktree Acquisition Corp., Rx Merger Sub, Inc. and the Company, dated as of
September [], 2020 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ")) or pursuant to any related
exchange agreement as contemplated in the Merger Agreement.

g. Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time or from time
to time on or after the date that the first share of Class F Common is issued
(the " _Original Issue Date_ ") the Company effects a subdivision of
the outstanding Class A Common, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately
before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. Conversely, if at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Company
combines the outstanding shares of Class A Common into a smaller number of
shares, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately before the combination
shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this Section 5(e)
shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision
or combination becomes effective.

h. Adjustment for Class A Common Dividends and Distributions. If at any time
or from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date the Company pays to
holders of Class A Common a dividend or other distribution in additional
shares of Class A Common, each Conversion Price then in effect shall be
decreased as of the time of such issuance, as provided below:

 

(i) Each Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the applicable
Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction equal to:

 

(a) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Class A Common
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and

(b) the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Class A Common
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance plus
the number of shares of Class A Common issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

 

(ii) If the Company fixes a record date to determine which holders of Class A
Common are entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, the
Conversion Prices shall be fixed as of the close of business on such record
date and the number of shares of Class A Common shall be calculated
immediately prior to the close of business on such record date; and

 

(iii) If such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if
such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the
Conversion Prices shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business
on such record date and thereafter the Conversion Prices shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Section 5(f) to reflect the actual payment of such
dividend or distribution.

 



21

    

i. Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution,
Reorganization, Merger or Consolidation. If at any time or from time to time
on or after the Original Issue Date the Class A Common issuable upon the
conversion of the Convertible Stock is changed into the same or a different
number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by
recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise, in any
such event each share of Convertible Stock shall thereafter be convertible in
lieu of the Class A Common into which it was convertible prior to such event
into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that a holder
of the number of shares of Class A Common issuable upon conversion of one
share of such class of Convertible Stock immediately prior to such
recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or other transaction
would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction, all subject
to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other
securities or property by the terms thereof and in any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section
5 with respect to the rights of the holders of applicable class of Convertible
Stock after the capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of this
Section 5 (including adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price then in
effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible
Stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as
practicable.

j. Notices of Record Date. Upon (i) any taking by the Company of a record of
the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the
holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other
distribution, (ii) any merger or consolidation or any sale or disposition, by
the Company or any subsidiary, of substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or other capital reorganization
of the Company, (iii) any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital
stock of the Company, or (iv) any voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company shall mail to each
holder of Convertible Stock at least twenty (20) days prior to (x) the record
date, if any, specified therein, or (y) if no record date is specified, the
date upon which such action is to take effect a notice specifying (A) the date
on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or
distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (B) the date
on which any such reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation,
merger, sale of substantially all assets, dissolution, liquidation or winding
up is expected to become effective, and (C) the date, if any, that is to be
fixed as to when the holders of record of Class A Common (or other securities)
shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Class A Common (or other
securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, sale of
substantially all assets, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

 

k. Automatic Conversion.

 

(i) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares
of Class A Common, based on the applicable then-effective Conversion Price,
immediately upon the earlier of (a) the closing of the Companys sale of its
Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to a
registration statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, that results in at least $30,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Company
(a " _Qualified Public Offering_ ") or (b) the date, or the occurrence of an
event, specified by vote or written consent or agreement of the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting as a single
class on an as-converted basis); 

 



22

    

 provided, however, that (1) if such automatic conversion is in connection
with or in contemplation of a Liquidation Event in which the proceeds to which
the holders of Series D Preferred Stock would be entitled pursuant to Section
2 hereof in respect of their shares of Series D Preferred Stock would be
greater than the proceeds such holders would receive if all such shares of
Series D Preferred Stock were converted to Class A Common immediately prior
to such Liquidation Event, the Series D Preferred Stock shall not be so
converted unless the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Series D Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall have approved
such conversion, (2) if such automatic conversion is in connection with or in
contemplation of a Liquidation Event in which the proceeds to which the
holders of Series C Preferred Stock would be entitled pursuant to Section 2
hereof in respect of their shares of Series C Preferred Stock would be greater
than the proceeds such holders would receive if all such shares of Series C
Preferred Stock were converted to Class A Common immediately prior to
such Liquidation Event, the Series C Preferred Stock shall not be so
converted unless the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Series C Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall have approved
such conversion, (3) if such automatic conversion is in connection with or in
contemplation of a Liquidation Event in which the proceeds to which the
holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock would be entitled pursuant to Section
2 hereof in respect of their shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock would be
greater than the proceeds such holders would receive if all such shares of
Series B-2 Preferred Stock were converted to Class A Common immediately prior
to such Liquidation Event, the Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall not be so
converted unless the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Series B-2 Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall have approved
such conversion, (4) if such automatic conversion is in connection with or in
contemplation of a Liquidation Event in which the proceeds to which the
holders of Series B-1 Preferred Stock would be entitled pursuant to Section 2
hereof in respect of their shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock would be
greater than the proceeds such holders would receive if all such shares of
Series B-1 Preferred Stock were converted to Class A Common immediately prior
to such Liquidation Event, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall not be so
converted unless the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall have
approved such conversion, (5) if such automatic conversion is in connection
with or in contemplation of a Liquidation Event in which the proceeds to which
the holders of Series B Preferred Stock would be entitled pursuant to Section
2 hereof in respect of their shares of Series B Preferred Stock would be
greater than the proceeds such holders would receive if all such shares of
Series B Preferred Stock were converted to Class A Common immediately prior
to such Liquidation Event, the Series B Preferred Stock shall not be so
converted unless the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall have approved
such conversion, and (6) if such automatic conversion is in connection with
or in contemplation of a Liquidation Event in which the proceeds to which the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock would be entitled pursuant to Section 2
hereof in respect of their shares of Series A Preferred Stock would be
greater than the proceeds such holders would receive if all such shares of
Series A Preferred Stock were converted to Class A Common immediately prior to
such Liquidation Event, the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be so
converted unless the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall have approved
such conversion. Each share of Class F Common shall automatically be
converted into shares of Class A Common, based on the applicable then-
effective Conversion Price, immediately upon the date, or the occurrence of an
event, specified by vote or written

 



23

    

 consent or agreement of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Class F Common.

 

(ii) Any shares of Class F Common purchased by an investor of the Company in
connection with an Equity Financing (as defined below) shall, subject to the
approval of the Board, automatically be converted immediately prior to such
transfer into shares of the series of Preferred Stock of the Company sold in
the Equity Financing at the then-effective Class F Common Conversion Rate;
provided that such investor must purchase such shares of Class F Common for
the same price as the shares of Preferred Stock sold in such Equity Financing.
Unless waived by all holders of Class F Common then outstanding, the Company
shall provide a notice to each holder of Class F Common of an expected closing
of an Equity Financing summarizing the material terms of such Equity Financing
at least five (5) business days prior to the initial closing of such Equity
Financing. For purposes of this Section, " _Equity Financing_ " shall mean an
equity financing of the Company in which the Company sells at least $1,000,000
worth of a newly created series of Preferred Stock of the Company.

(iii) Any share of Class F Common transferred, other than pursuant to Section
5(i)(ii) above, shall automatically be converted immediately prior to such
transfer into shares of Class A Common at the then-effective Class F Common
Conversion Rate.

 

(iv) (A) Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Sections
5(i)(i), 5(i)(ii) or 5(i)(iii) above, the outstanding shares of Class F
Common shall be converted automatically without any further action by the
holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such
shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent and (B) upon
the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 5(i)(i) above, the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without
any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Company or its
transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to
issue certificates evidencing the shares of Class A Common issuable upon such
conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock
or Class F Common, as applicable, are either delivered to the Company or its
transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Company or its
transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the
occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock or Class F
Common, the holders of Preferred Stock or Class F Common, as applicable, shall
surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of the
Company or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or Class F Common, as
applicable. Thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder
promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such surrendered
certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number
of shares of Class A Common into which the shares of Preferred Stock or Class
F Common surrendered were convertible on the date on which such automatic
conversion occurred.

 

l. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Class A Common shall be issued
upon conversion of Convertible Stock. All shares of Class A Common (including
fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of
Convertible Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of
determining whether the conversion would 

 



24

    

 result in the issuance of any fractional share. If after the aforementioned
aggregation the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional
share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay cash
equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of
one share of Preferred Stock or Class F Common, as applicable, (as determined
in good faith by the Board) on the date of conversion. 

m. Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of
Class A Common, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the
shares of the Convertible Stock, such number of its shares of Class A Common
as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of the Convertible Stock. If at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common shall not be sufficient to
effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the
Convertible Stock, the Company will take such corporate action as may be
necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common to
such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

 

n. Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5 shall be
in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery
to the party to be notified, (ii) when sent by electronic transmission in
compliance with the provisions of the DGCL if sent during normal business
hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) five (5)
days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) one (1) day after deposit with a
nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with
verification of receipt. All notices shall be addressed to each holder of
record at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the Company.

 

o. Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all taxes (other than taxes based
upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect
to the issue or delivery of shares of Class A Common upon conversion of shares
of Convertible Stock, excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection
with any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Class A
Common in a name other than that in which the shares of Convertible Stock so
converted were registered.

 

p. Implementation of Dual Class Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the approval, adoption, filing, consummation and/or
implementation of the AandR Dual Class Company Charter, the Dual Class
Structure, the Company Recapitalization (each as defined in the Merger
Agreement) or pursuant to any related exchange agreement as contemplated in
the Merger Agreement shall not be deemed to be an issuance of Additional Stock
or a First Dilutive Issuance or Subsequent Dilutive Issuance and shall not
result in the adjustment of any Conversion Rate or Conversion
Price hereunder.

6\. NO REISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE STOCK. Any shares of Convertible Stock
redeemed, purchased, converted or exchanged by the Company shall be cancelled
and retired and shall not be reissued or transferred.

 



25

    

V.

 

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the
Company, and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers
of the Company, of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof,
as the case may be, it is further provided that:

 

A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the
Company shall be vested in its Board. The number of directors that shall
constitute the whole Board shall be fixed by the Board in the manner provided
in the Bylaws, subject to any restrictions which may be set forth in this

applicable law permits the Company to provide indemnification) through Bylaw
provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the indemnification and
advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law. If applicable law is
amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a director to the Company shall be eliminated
or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so amended.

C. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall only be prospective
and shall not affect the rights or protections or increase the liability of
any director under this Article VI in effect at the time of the alleged
occurrence of any act or omission to act giving rise to liability
or indemnification.

VII.

 

The Company renounces, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any interest or
expectancy of the Company in, or in being offered an opportunity to
participate in, any Excluded Opportunity. An " _Excluded Opportunity_ " is any
matter, transaction or interest that is presented to, or acquired, created or
developed by, or which otherwise comes into the possession of (i) any
director of the Company who is not an employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or (ii) any holder of Preferred Stock (or any affiliate thereof)
or any partner, member, director, stockholder, employee or agent of any
such holder (or such affiliate), other than someone who is

 



26

    

 an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, "
_Covered Persons_ "), unless such matter, transaction or interest is presented
to, or acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes into the
possession of, a Covered Person expressly and solely in such Covered Persons
capacity as a director of the Company.

THIRD: The foregoing amendment and restatement was approved by the holders of
the requisite number of shares of the Company in accordance with Section 228
of the DGCL.

 

FOURTH: That said Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which restates and
integrates and further amends the provisions of the Companys Restated

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been
executed by a duly authorized officer of this corporation on this []th day of

disposition of all the Registrable Securities during the Effectiveness Period.

 

2.1.4 _Notice of Certain Events_. The Company shall promptly notify the
Investors in writing of any request by the Commission for any amendment or

holders of Registrable Securities with an estimated market value of at least
$25,000,000 that the Company effect a Underwritten Takedown of all or any

shall promptly give notice of such requested Underwritten Takedown at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the anticipated filing date of the prospectus
or supplement relating to such Underwritten Takedown to the other Investors
and

 thereupon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect, as
expeditiously as possible, the offering in such Underwritten Takedown of:

 

(i) subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, all
Registrable Securities for which the requesting holder has requested such
offering under _Section_ __ _ 2.1.5_, and

(ii) subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, all other
Registrable Securities that any holders of Registrable Securities have
requested the Company to offer by request received by the Company within one
(1) Business Day after such holders receive the Companys notice of the
Underwritten Takedown Notice, all to the extent necessary to permit the
disposition (in accordance with the intended methods thereof as aforesaid) of
the Registrable Securities so to be offered.

(a) Promptly after the expiration of the one-Business Day-period referred to
in _Section_ __ _ 2.1.5(ii)_, the Company will notify all selling holders of
the identities of the other selling holders and the number of shares of
Registrable Securities requested to be included therein.

(b) the Company shall only be required to effectuate one Underwritten Takedown
pursuant to this Agreement within any six-month period.

2.1.6 _Block Trade_. If the Company shall receive a request from the holders

2.1.7 _Withdrawal_. Holders of majority-in-interest of the Registrable
Securities included in an Underwritten Takedown may elect to withdraw from
such Underwritten Takedown by giving written notice to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters of their request to withdraw prior to the public
announcement of such Underwritten Takedown, in which case, such withdrawn
Underwritten Takedown will count as an Underwritten Takedown for the
purposes of _Section_ __ _ 2.1.5(b)_ unless the withdrawing Holders
reimburse the Company for all Registration Expenses with respect to such
Underwritten Takedown; _provided_ , _however_ , that if at the time of such
withdrawal, the withdrawing Holders have learned of a material adverse change
in the condition, business or prospects of the Company from that known to the
Holders at the time of their request and have withdrawn the request with
reasonable promptness following disclosure by the Company of such material
adverse change, then the withdrawing Holders shall not be required to pay any
of such expenses and shall retain their rights pursuant to _Sections_ __ _
2.1.5(b)_. Following the receipt of a notice of withdrawal, the Company shall
promptly forward such notice to any other Holders that had elected to
participate in such Underwritten Takedown. The Company shall be responsible
for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with an Underwritten
Takedown prior to its withdrawal under this _ Section_ __ _ 2.1.7_, other
than if a Holder elects to pay such Registration Expenses pursuant to this _
Section_ __ _ 2.1.7_.

 



6

    

2.1.8 _Selection of Underwriters_. Selling holders holding a majority in
interest of the Registrable Securities requested to be sold in an
Underwritten Takedown shall have the right to select an Underwriter or
Underwriters in connection with such Underwritten Takedown, which Underwriter
or Underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. In connection
with an Underwritten Takedown, the Company shall enter into customary
agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take
such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite
or facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities in such
Underwritten Takedown, including, if necessary, the engagement of a "qualified
independent underwriter" in connection with the qualification of the
underwriting arrangements with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
Inc. No holder participating in an Underwritten Takedown shall be required to
make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or
the Underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements
regarding such holders authority to enter into such underwriting agreement
and to sell, and its ownership of, the securities being registered on its
behalf, its intended method of distribution and any other representation
required by law.

2.1.9 Underwritten Takedowns effected pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.1_
shall be counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2_.

2.2 _Demand Registration_.

 

2.2.1 _Request for Registration_. At any time and from time to time, subject
to compliance by the Investors with  _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, and provided that
there is not an effective Resale Shelf Registration Statement available for
the resale of the Registerable Securities pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_,
Investors who hold a majority of the Registrable Securities held by all
Investors may make a written demand for Registration under the Securities Act
of all or any portion of their Registrable Securities on Form S-1 or any
similar long-form Registration or, if then available, on Form S-3. Each
registration requested pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2.1_ is referred to
herein as a "Demand Registration." Any demand for a Demand Registration shall
specify the number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and
the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. The Company will notify all
Investors that are holders of Registrable Securities of the demand, and each
such holder of Registrable Securities who wishes to include all or a portion
of such holders Registrable Securities in the Demand Registration (each such
holder including shares of Registrable Securities in such registration, a
"Demanding Holder") shall so notify the Company within twenty (20) days after
the receipt by the holder of the notice from the Company. Upon any such
request, the Demanding Holders shall be entitled to have their Registrable
Securities included in the Demand Registration, subject to _Section_ __ _
2.2.4_ and the provisos set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1.1_. The Company shall
not be obligated pursuant to this Agreement to effect more than one (1)
Demand Registration during any six-month period or any Demand Registration at
any time there is an effective Resale Shelf Registration Statement on file
with the Commission pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_.

2.2.2 _Effective Registration_. A Registration will not count as a Demand
Registration until the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Demand Registration has been declared effective and the
Company has complied with all of its obligations under this Agreement with
respect thereto; provided, however, that if, after such Registration
Statement has been declared effective, the offering of Registrable Securities

 



7

    

 pursuant to a Demand Registration is interfered with by any stop order or
injunction of the Commission or any other governmental agency or court, the
Registration Statement with respect to such Demand Registration will be
deemed not to have been declared effective, unless and until, (i) such stop
order or injunction is removed, rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a
majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders thereafter elect to continue the
offering; provided, further, that the Company shall not be obligated to file a
second Registration Statement until a Registration Statement that has been
filed is counted as a Demand Registration or is terminated.

2.2.3 _Underwritten Demand Registration_. If the Demanding Holders so elect
and such holders so advise the Company as part of their written demand for a
Demand Registration, the offering of such Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Demand Registration shall be in the form of an Underwritten Demand
Registration. In such event, the right of any holder to include its
Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such
holders participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such
holders Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided
herein. All Demanding Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable
Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected for
such underwriting by the holders initiating the Demand Registration, and
subject to the approval of the Company. The parties agree that, in order to be
effected, any Underwritten Demand Registration must result in either
aggregate proceeds to the selling shareholders of at least $25,000,000.

2.2.4 _Withdrawal_. A majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders may elect
to withdraw from such Demand Registration by giving written notice to the
Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters of their request to withdraw
prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the
Commission with respect to such Demand Registration, in which case, such
withdrawn Demand Registration will count as a Demand Registration for
the purposes of _Section_ __ _ 2.2.1_ unless the withdrawing Holders
reimburse the Company for all Registration Expenses with respect to such
Demand Registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that if at the time of such
withdrawal, the withdrawing Holders have learned of a material adverse change
in the condition, business or prospects of the Company from that known to the
Holders at the time of their request and have withdrawn the request with
reasonable promptness following disclosure by the Company of such material
adverse change, then the withdrawing Holders shall not be required to pay any
of such expenses and shall retain their rights pursuant to _Sections_ __ _
2.1.5(b)_. Following the receipt of a notice of withdrawal, the Company shall
promptly forward such notice to any other Holders that had elected to
participate in such Demand Registration. The Company shall be responsible for
the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with a Demand Registration
prior to its withdrawal under this _ Section_ __ _ 2.2.4_, other than if a
Holder elects to pay such Registration Expenses pursuant to this _ Section_
__ _ 2.2.4_.

 

2.3 _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters for an underwritten offering conducted pursuant to this
Agreement advises the Company and the Investors requesting to include
Registrable Securities in such underwritten offering in writing that, in such
Underwriters or Underwriters opinion, the dollar amount or number of shares
of Registrable Securities which the Investors have requested to include in
such underwritten offering, taken together with all other shares of Common
Stock or other securities which the Company desires to sell and the Common
Stock or other securities, if any, as to which

 



8

    

 registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back
registration rights held by other equityholders of the Company who desire to
sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of securities that
can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering
price, the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of
such offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares, as
applicable, the "Maximum Number of Shares"), then the Company shall include in
such registration: (i) first, the Registrable Securities requested to be
included by Investors pursuant to this Agreement and any securities requested
to be included by equityholders of the Company pursuant to the Investor Rights
Agreement (pro rata in accordance with the number of shares that each such
person has requested be included in such registration, regardless of
the number of shares held by each such person (such proportion is referred to
herein as "Pro Rata")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number
of Shares; (ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares
has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i), the securities of the
Company that the Company desires to sell for its own account; and (iii) any
securities of the Company for the account of other persons that the Company is
obligated to register pursuant to written contractual arrangements with such
persons, other than pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, as to which
"piggy-back" registration has been requested by the holders thereof that can
be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

2.4 _Piggy-Back Registration_.

 

2.4.1 _Piggy-Back Rights_. If at any time, subject to compliance by the
Investors with _Section_ __ _ 3.4,_ the Company proposes to file a
Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of
equity securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or
exchangeable for, or convertible into, equity securities, by the Company for
its own account or for equityholders of the Company for their account, other

option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of
securities solely to the Companys existing stockholders, (iii) for an
offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the Company,
(iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, or (v) for a corporate reorganization
or transaction under Rule 145 of the Securities Act, then the Company shall
(x) give written notice of such proposed filing to the holders of Registrable
Securities as soon as practicable but in no event less than five (5) days
before the anticipated filing date, which notice shall describe the amount
and type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s)
of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter or
Underwriters, if any, of the offering, and (y) offer to the holders of
Registrable Securities in such notice the opportunity to register the sale of
such number of shares of Registrable Securities as such holders may request in
writing within three (3) days following receipt of such notice (a "Piggy-Back
Registration"). The Company shall cause such Registrable Securities to be
included in such registration and shall use its best efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested to be included in a Piggy-Back
Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of the
Company and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.
All holders of Registrable Securities proposing to distribute their securities
through a Piggy-Back Registration that involves an Underwriter or
Underwriters shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form
with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such Piggy-Back
Registration.

2.4.2 _Reduction of Piggy-Back Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or

desires to sell for its own account, taken together with securities of the
Company, if any, as to which registration has been demanded pursuant to
written contractual arrangements with persons other than the holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder and the Registrable Securities as to which

such holders request for inclusion of Registrable Securities in any Piggy-
Back Registration by giving written notice to the Company of such request to

public announcement of the offering, if such offering is pursuant to an
Underwritten Takedown, or similar transaction. The Company (whether on its own
determination or as the result of a withdrawal by persons making a demand

amendment to such Registration Statement becomes effective; (iii) the issuance
or threatened issuance by the Commission of any stop order (and the Company
shall take all actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to
remove it if entered); and (iv) any request by the Commission for any
amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or any prospectus
relating thereto or for additional information or of the occurrence of an
event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such
prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
securities covered by such Registration Statement, such prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of 

 



12

    

 a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
promptly make available to the holders of Registrable Securities included in
such Registration Statement any such supplement or amendment; except that
before filing with the Commission a Registration Statement or prospectus or
any amendment or supplement thereto, excluding documents incorporated by
reference, the Company shall furnish to the holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement and to the legal counsel for any such
holders, copies of all such documents proposed to be filed sufficiently
in advance of filing to provide such holders and legal counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review such documents and comment thereon.

 

3.1.5 _Securities Laws Compliance_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities
covered by the Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws
of such jurisdictions in the United States as the holders of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement (in light of
their intended plan of distribution) may reasonably request and (ii) take
such action necessary to cause such Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other
governmental authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Company and do any and all other acts and things that may be
necessary or advisable to enable the holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement to consummate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for
this paragraph or subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction.

expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities.

Underwritten Demand Registration, the Company shall obtain a "cold comfort"
letter from the Companys independent registered public accountants in the
event of an underwritten offering, and a customary "bring-down" thereof, in
customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by
"cold comfort" letters, as the managing Underwriter may reasonably request,
and, if addressed to the participating holders, reasonably satisfactory to
a majority-in-interest of the participating holders. For the avoidance of
doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 3.1.7_ shall not apply to Block Trades.

 

3.1.8 _Opinions and Negative Assurance Letters_. In the event of an
Underwritten Takedown or an Underwritten Demand Registration, on the date the
Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant to any Registration,
the Company shall obtain an opinion and negative assurances letter, each dated

such Registration, including an opinion of local counsel if applicable,
addressed to the holders, the placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the
Underwriters, if any, covering such legal matters with respect to such
Registration in respect of which such opinion is being given as the holders,
placement agent, sales agent, or Underwriter may reasonably request and as are
customarily included in such opinions, and, if addressed to the participating
holders, 

 



13

    

 reasonably satisfactory to a majority in interest of the participating
holders. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 3.1.8_ shall not
apply to Block Trades.

 

3.1.9 _Cooperation_. The principal executive officer of the Company, the
principal financial officer of the Company, the principal accounting officer
of the Company (if different from the principal financial officer) and all
other officers and members of the management of the Company shall cooperate
fully in any offering of Registrable Securities hereunder, which
cooperation shall include, without limitation, the preparation of the
Registration Statement with respect to such offering and all other offering
materials and related documents, and participation in meetings with
Underwriters, attorneys, accountants and potential investors.

3.1.10 _Transfer Agent_. The Company shall provide and maintain a transfer
agent and registrar for the Registrable Securities.

3.1.11 _Records_. Upon execution of confidentiality agreements, the Company
shall make available for inspection by the holders of Registrable Securities

disposition pursuant to such registration statement and any attorney,
accountant or other professional retained by any holder of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement or any Underwriter, all
financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of
the Company, as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to
exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the Companys
officers, directors and employees to supply all information requested by any
of them in connection with such Registration Statement.

 

3.1.12 _Earnings Statement_. The Company shall comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the Commission and the Securities Act, and make
available to its stockholders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement
covering a period of twelve (12) months, which earnings statement shall
satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule
158 thereunder.

3.1.13 _Road Show_. If an offering pursuant to this Agreement is conducted as
an Underwritten Takedown or Underwritten Demand Registration and involves
Registrable Securities with an aggregate offering price (before deduction of
underwriting discounts) exceeds $50,000,000, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make available senior executives of the
Company to participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be
reasonably requested by the Underwriter in such offering.

 

3.1.14 _Listing_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement to be
listed on such exchanges or otherwise designated for trading in the same
manner as similar securities issued by the Company are then listed or
designated.

 

3.2 _Obligation to Suspend Distribution_. Upon receipt of any written notice
from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
_Section_ __ _ 3.1.4(iv)_, or, upon any suspension by the Company, pursuant
to a written insider trading compliance program adopted by the Board, of the
ability of all "insiders" covered by such program to transact in the

 



14

    

 Companys securities because of the existence of material non-public
information, each holder of Registrable Securities included in any
registration shall immediately discontinue disposition of such Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable
Securities until such holder receives the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 3.1.4(iv)_ or the restriction on the ability
of "insiders" to transact in the Companys securities is removed, as
applicable, and, if so directed by the Company, each such holder will deliver
to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such
holders possession, of the most recent prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities at the time of receipt of such notice. The foregoing right to delay
or suspend may be exercised by the Company for no longer than 120 days in any
consecutive 12-month period. Any suspension by the Company pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 3.2_ shall only apply to an Investor hereunder to the extent
that such suspension also applies to all stockholders of the Company party to
the Investor Rights Agreement.

3.3  _Registration Expenses_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.1.7_ and _Section_
__ _ 2.2.4_, the Company shall bear all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Resale Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.1_, any Demand Registration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2.1_, any
Underwritten Takedown pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1.5_, any Block Trade
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1.6 _(other than expenses set forth below in
clause (ix) of this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_), any Piggy-Back Registration
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4.1_, and all expenses incurred in performing
or complying with its other obligations under this Agreement, whether or not
the Registration Statement becomes effective, including, without limitation:
(i) all registration and filing fees; (ii) fees and expenses of compliance
with securities or "blue sky" laws (including fees and disbursements of
counsel in connection with blue sky qualifications of the Registrable
Securities); (iii) printing expenses; (iv) the Companys internal expenses
(including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and
employees); (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing
of the Registrable Securities as required by  _Section_ __ _ 3.1.14_; (vi)
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. fees; (vii) fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company and fees and expenses for independent
certified public accountants retained by the Company; (viii) the fees and
expenses of any special experts retained by the Company in connection with
such registration; and (ix) the reasonable fees and expenses of one legal
counsel selected by the holders of a majority-in-interest of the Registrable
Securities included in such registration not to exceed $75,000. The Company
shall have no obligation to pay any underwriting discounts or selling
commissions attributable to the Registrable Securities being sold by the
holders thereof, which underwriting discounts or selling commissions shall be
borne by such holders, but the Company shall pay any underwriting discounts or
selling commissions attributable to the securities it sells for its own
account.

3.4 _Information_. The holders of Registrable Securities shall promptly
provide such information as may reasonably be requested by the Company, or the
managing Underwriter, if any, in connection with the preparation of any
Registration Statement, including amendments and supplements thereto, in order
to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities
Act and in connection with the Companys obligation to comply with Federal and
applicable state securities laws.

 

3.5 _Other Obligations_. At any time and from time to time in connection with
a sale or transfer of Registrable Securities exempt from registration under
the Securities Act or through

 



15

    

 any broker-dealer transactions described in the plan of distribution set
forth within any prospectus and pursuant to the Registration Statement of
which such prospectus forms a part, the Company shall, subject to the receipt
of customary documentation required from the applicable holders in connection
therewith and compliance with applicable laws, (i) promptly instruct its
transfer agent to remove any restrictive legends applicable to the
Registrable Securities being sold or transferred and (ii) cause its legal
counsel to deliver the necessary legal opinions, if any, to the transfer agent
in connection with the instruction under subclause (i). In addition, the
Company shall cooperate reasonably with, and take such customary actions as
may reasonably be requested by such holders in connection with the
aforementioned sales or transfers.

 

4\. _INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION_.

4.1  _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities,
and each of their respective affiliates and each of their respective officers,
employees, directors, partners, members, attorneys and agents, and each
person, if any, who controls an Investor and each other holder of Registrable
Securities (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act) (each, an "Investor Indemnified Party"), from and
against any expenses, losses, judgments, claims, damages or liabilities,
whether joint or several, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement
(or allegedly untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement under which the sale of such Registrable Securities was
registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus or summary prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, or
any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement, or arising out of
or based upon any omission (or alleged omission) to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, or any violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any rule
or regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to
action or inaction required of the Company in connection with any
such registration; and the Company shall promptly reimburse the Investor
Indemnified Party for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by
such Investor Indemnified Party in connection with investigating and defending
any such expense, loss, judgment, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the
extent that any such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of
or is based upon any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus, or summary prospectus, or any such amendment or
supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to
the Company, in writing, by such selling holder expressly for use therein, or
is based on any selling holders violation of the federal securities laws
(including Regulation M) or failure to sell the Registrable Securities
in accordance with the plan of distribution contained in the prospectus.

4.2 _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Each selling
holder of Registrable Securities will, in the event that any Registration is
being effected under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement of any
Registrable Securities held by such selling holder, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, each of its directors and officers, and each other
selling holder and each other person, if any, who controls another selling
holder within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims,
judgments, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several, insofar as such
losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities (or

 



16

    

 actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement under which the sale of such Registrable Securities
was registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus or summary prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, or
any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, or arise out of or
are based upon any omission or the alleged omission to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not
misleading, if the statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such
selling holder expressly for use therein, or is based on any selling holders
violation of the federal securities laws (including Regulation M) or failure
to sell the Registrable Securities in accordance with the plan of
distribution contained in the prospectus, and shall reimburse the Company, its
directors and officers, and each other selling holder or controlling person
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in
connection with investigation or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action. Each selling holders indemnification obligations
hereunder shall be several and not joint and shall be limited to the amount of
any net proceeds actually received by such selling holder.

4.3 _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Promptly after receipt by
any person of any notice of any loss, claim, damage or liability or any
action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Sections 4.1_
or _4.2_ , such person (the "Indemnified Party") shall, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against any other person for indemnification
hereunder, notify such other person (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of
the loss, claim, judgment, damage, liability or action; provided, however,
that the failure by the Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability which the
Indemnifying Party may have to such Indemnified Party hereunder, except and
solely to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such
failure. If the Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification with respect to
any claim or action brought against the Indemnified Party, then the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in such claim or action,
and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with all other Indemnifying
Parties, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party. After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume control of the defense of such
claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified
Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; provided, however, that in any action in which both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are named as defendants, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (but no
more than one such separate counsel, which counsel is reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnifying Party) to represent the Indemnified Party and its controlling
persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in
respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Indemnified Party against the
Indemnifying Party, with the fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by
such Indemnifying Party if, based upon the written opinion of counsel of such
Indemnified Party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would
be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.
No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, consent to entry of judgment or effect any settlement of
any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the
Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been
sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such 

 



17

    

 judgment or settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding.

 

4.4 _Contribution_.

4.4.1 If the indemnification provided for in the foregoing _Sections 4.1_ ,
_4.2_ and/or _4.3_ is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in respect of any
loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein, then each such
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnified Parties and the
Indemnifying Parties in connection with the actions or omissions which
resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of any
Indemnified Party and any Indemnifying Party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by such Indemnified Party or such
Indemnifying Party and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

 

4.4.2 The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in _Section_ __ _ 4.4.1_.

 

4.4.3 The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of any
loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth above in _Section_ __ _ 4.4.1_, any legal or other expenses incurred by
such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_,
no holder of Registrable Securities shall be required to contribute any amount
in excess of the dollar amount of the net proceeds (after payment of any
underwriting fees, discounts, commissions or taxes) actually received by such
holder from the sale of Registrable Securities which gave rise to such
contribution obligation. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

5\. _UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION_.

5.1  _Rule 144_. The Company covenants that it shall file any reports
required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
shall take such further action as the holders of Registrable Securities may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable
such holders to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144
under the Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or
any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission.

 



18

    

6\. _MISCELLANEOUS_.

 

6.1 _Other Registration Rights and Arrangements_. Other than with respect to
the Investor Rights Agreement and the Subscription Agreements, the Company
represents and warrants that no person, other than a holder of the Registrable
Securities has any right to require the Company to register any of the
Companys share capital or capital stock for sale or to include the Companys
share capital or capital stock in any registration filed by the Company for
the sale of shares for its own account or for the account of any other person.
The parties hereby terminate the Original RRA, which shall be of no
further force and effect and is hereby superseded and replaced in its
entirety by this Agreement. The Company shall not hereafter enter into any
agreement with respect to its securities which is inconsistent with or
violates the rights granted to the holders of Registrable Securities in this
Agreement and in the event of any conflict between any such agreement or
agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Investor Rights Agreement shall not be deemed
inconsistent with or to violate this Agreement.

6.2 _Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
rights, duties and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be assigned or
delegated by the Company in whole or in part. This Agreement and any of the
rights, duties and obligations of the holders of Registrable Securities
hereunder may be freely assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by such
holder of Registrable Securities in conjunction with and to the extent of any
transfer of any Registrable Security by any such holder to a Permitted
Transferee(s). This Agreement and the provisions hereof shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns and the holders of Registrable Securities
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement is not
intended to confer any rights or benefits on any persons that are not party
hereto other than as expressly set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4_ and this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_. The rights of a holder of Registrable Securities under
this Agreement may be transferred, in whole or in part, by such a holder to a
transferee who acquires or holds any Registrable Security; provided, however,
that such transferee has executed and delivered to the Company a properly
completed agreement to be bound by the terms of this Agreement substantially
in form attached hereto as Exhibit A (a "Joinder"), and the transferor shall
have delivered to the Company no later than five (5) business days following
the date of the transfer, written notification of such transfer setting forth
the name of the transferor, the name and address of the transferee, and the
number of Registrable Securities so transferred. The execution of a
Joinder shall constitute a permitted amendment of this Agreement.

6.3 _Amendments and Modifications_. Upon the written consent of the
Company and the holders of at least a majority in interest of the Registrable
Securities at the time in question, compliance with any of the provisions,
covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement may be waived, or any of
such provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended or modified;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or
waiver hereof that adversely affects an Investor, solely in his, her or its
capacity as a holder of the securities of the Company, in a manner that is
materially different from other Investors (in such capacity) shall require the
consent of such Investor so affected. No course of dealing between any
Investor or the Company and any other party hereto or any failure or delay on
the part of an Investor or the Company in exercising any rights or remedies
under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies of
any Investor or the Company. No single or partial exercise of any 

 



19

    

 rights or remedies under this Agreement by a party shall operate as a waiver
or preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or
thereunder by such party.

 

6.4 _Term_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the tenth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement or (ii) the date as of which there
shall be no Registrable Securities outstanding; provided further that with
respect to any Investor, such Investor will have no rights under this
Agreement and all obligations of the Company to such Investor under this
Agreement shall terminate upon the date that such Investor no longer holds
Registrable Securities.

6.5 _Notices_. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals or other
communications (collectively, "Notices") required or permitted to be given
hereunder or which are given with respect to this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be personally served, delivered by reputable air courier
service with charges prepaid, or transmitted by facsimile or email, addressed
as set forth below, or to such other address as such party shall have
specified most recently by written notice. Notice shall be deemed given (i)
on the date of service or transmission if personally served or transmitted by
telegram, telex, email or facsimile; provided, that if such service or
transmission is not on a Business Day or is after normal business hours,
then such notice shall be deemed given on the next Business Day or (ii) one
Business Day after being deposited with a reputable courier service with an
order for next-day delivery, to the parties as follows:

affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or of any other term
or provision hereof. Furthermore, in lieu of any such invalid or unenforceable

maintenance of the executed agreement electronically.

 



21

    

6.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all agreements entered into
pursuant hereto and all certificates and instruments delivered pursuant

respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and

discussions between the parties, whether oral or written, including, without
limitation the Original RRA.

 

6.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the rights of the parties under or in
connection herewith or in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and all actions arising in whole or in part under or in
connection herewith or therewith (whether at law or in equity, whether
sounding in contract, tort, statute or otherwise), shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic substantive laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or
rule that would cause the application of the domestic substantive laws of any
other jurisdiction.

 

6.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue; Service_. Each party to this Agreement,
by its execution hereof, (i) hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
located in Wilmington, Delaware, or if (but only if) such court does not have
subject matter jurisdiction, the state or federal courts located in the State
of Delaware for the purpose of any suit, action or other proceeding described
in _Section_ __ _ 6.9_; (ii) hereby waives to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, and agrees not to assert, and agrees not to allow any of
its subsidiaries to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in
any such suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is
exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in one of the above-named courts is improper, or that this
Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such
court; and (iii) hereby agrees not to commence or maintain any such action
other than before one of the above-named courts nor to make any motion or take
any other action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or removal of any
such action to any court other than one of the above-named courts whether on
the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise. Each party to this Agreement
hereby also (x) consents to service of process in any action described in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_ in any manner permitted by Delaware law, (y) agrees
that service of process made in accordance with clause (x) or made by
overnight delivery by a nationally recognized courier service addressed to a
partys address specified pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ shall constitute
good and valid service of process in any such action and (z) waives and agrees
not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise) in any such action
any claim that service of process made in accordance with clause (x) or (y)
does not constitute good and valid service of process. Notwithstanding the
foregoing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, a party may commence any action in a
court other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing
an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named courts.

6.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW

other transfer of such Registrable Securities pursuant to the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement to its members, partners, stockholders, as the case

the Company reasonably acceptable to such transfer agent and registrar, that
any legend referring to the Act may be removed in connection with such
proposed distribution or other transfer of such Registrable Securities
pursuant to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement, _provided_ a distributee
or transferee of such Registrable Securities is not and has not been for the
preceding ninety (90) days an affiliate of Parent (as defined in Rule 405
promulgated under the Act). Parents obligations hereunder are conditioned
upon the receipt of representation letter reasonably acceptable to Parent
from such Holder regarding such proposed distribution or other transfer of
such Registrable Securities.

 



5

    

2.2 _Request for Registration_.

 

(a) Subject to the conditions of this Section 2.2, if Parent shall receive at
any time after the earlier of (i) four (4) years after the date of this
Agreement or (ii) one hundred and eighty (180) days after the closing of the
Merger, a written request from the Holders of at least 30% of the Registrable
Securities then outstanding (for purposes of this Section 2.2, the "
_Initiating Holders_ ") that Parent file a registration statement under the
Act covering the registration of Registrable Securities with an anticipated
aggregate offering price of at least $10,000,000, then Parent shall,
within twenty (20) days of the receipt thereof, give written notice of such
request to all Holders and, subject to the limitations of this Section 2.2,
use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect, as soon as practicable, the
registration under the Act of all Registrable Securities that the Holders
request to be registered in a written request received by the Company within
twenty (20) days of the mailing of Parents notice pursuant to this Section
2.2(a).

 

(b) If the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities
covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise
Parent as a part of their request made pursuant to this Section 2.2, and
Parent shall include such information in the written notice referred to in
Section 2.2(a). In such event the right of any Holder to include its
Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such
Holders participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holders
Registrable Securities in the underwriting (unless otherwise mutually agreed
by a majority in interest of the Initiating Holders and such Holder) to the
extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their securities
through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such
underwriting by those Initiating Holders holding a majority of the Registrable
Securities then held by all Initiating Holders (which underwriter or
underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent). Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Section 2.2, if the underwriter advises Parent that
marketing factors require a limitation on the number of securities
underwritten (including Registrable Securities), then Parent shall so advise
all Holders of Registrable Securities that would otherwise be underwritten
pursuant hereto, and the number of shares that may be included in the
underwriting shall be allocated to the Holders of such Registrable Securities
and the equityholders of Parent who request to have securities registered
pursuant to the exercise of contractual piggyback registration rights under
the Registration Rights Agreement pro rata based on the number of Registrable
Securities each such Holder and each such participating equityholder party to
the Registration Rights Agreement has requested to be included in such
underwriting (including the Initiating Holders). In no event shall any
Registrable Securities be excluded from such underwriting unless all other
securities (other than those subject to the Registration Rights Agreement) are
first excluded. Any Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from such
underwriting shall be withdrawn from the registration.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to effect a
registration pursuant to this Section 2.2:

 

(i) in any particular jurisdiction in which Parent would be required to
execute a general consent to service of process in effecting
such registration, unless

 



6

    

 Parent is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may
be required under the Act; or

 

(ii) after Parent has effected two (2) registrations pursuant to this Section
2.2, and such registrations have been declared or ordered effective; or

(iii) during the period starting with the date sixty (60) days prior to
Parents good faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on the
date one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of, a Parent-
initiated registration subject to Section 2.3 below, _provided_ that Parent is
actively employing in good faith its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such registration statement to become effective; or

(iv) if the Initiating Holders propose to dispose of Registrable Securities
that may be registered on Form S-3 pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof; or

 

(v) if Parent shall furnish to Holders requesting a registration statement
pursuant to this Section 2.2 a certificate signed by Parents Chief Executive
Officer or Chairman of the Board stating that in the good faith judgment of
the Board, it would be seriously detrimental to Parent and its stockholders
for such registration statement to be effected or remain effective at such
time, in which event Parent shall have the right to defer such filing for a
period of not more than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the
request of the Initiating Holders; _provided_ that such right shall be
exercised by Parent not more than once in any twelve (12) month period; and
_provided_ _further_ that Parent shall not register any securities for the
account of itself or any other stockholder during such one hundred twenty
(120) day period (other than an Excluded Registration).

2.3 _Parent Registration_.

 

(a) If (but without any obligation to do so) Parent proposes to register
(including for this purpose a registration effected by Parent
for stockholders other than the Holders) any of its stock or other securities
under the Act in connection with the public offering of such securities (other
than (i) a registration relating to a demand pursuant to Section 2.2 of
this Agreement, (ii) an Excluded Registration, (iii) a registration statement
filed during the one hundred and eighty (180) days after the closing of the
Merger), Parent shall, at such time, promptly give each Holder written notice
of such registration. Upon the written request of each Holder given within
twenty (20) days after mailing of such notice by Parent in accordance with
Section 4.6 of this Agreement, Parent shall, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.3(c), use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
registered under the Act all of the Registrable Securities that each such
Holder requests to be registered.

 

(b) _Right to Terminate Registration_. Parent shall have the right to
terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section 2.3
prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not any Holder has
elected to include securities in such registration. The expenses of such
withdrawn registration shall be borne by Parent in accordance with Section
2.7 hereof.

(c) _Underwriting Requirements_. In connection with any offering involving an
underwriting of shares of Parents capital stock, Parent shall not be
required under

 



7

    

 this Section 2.3 to include any of the Holders securities in such
underwriting unless they accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon
between Parent and the underwriters selected by Parent (or by other Persons
entitled to select the underwriters) and enter into an underwriting agreement
in customary form with such underwriters, and then only in such quantity as
the underwriters determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the
success of the offering by Parent. If the total amount of securities,
including Registrable Securities, requested by stockholders to be included in
such offering exceeds the amount of securities sold other than by Parent
that the underwriters determine in their sole discretion is compatible with
the success of the offering, then Parent shall be required to include in the
offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable
Securities, that the underwriters determine in their sole discretion will not
jeopardize the success of the offering. In the event that the underwriters
determine that less than all of the Registrable Securities requested to be
registered can be included in such offering, then the Registrable Securities
that are included in such offering shall be apportioned pro rata among the
selling Holders and the equityholders of the Company who request to have
securities registered pursuant to the exercise of contractual
piggyback registration rights under the Registration Rights Agreement based
on the number of Registrable Securities each such Holder and each such
participating equityholder party to the Registration Rights Agreement has
requested to be included in such underwriting, or in such other proportions
as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Holders and participating
equityholders party to the Registration Rights Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall (i) any Registrable Securities be excluded from
such offering unless all other stockholders securities (other than those
subject to the Registration Rights Agreement) have been first excluded from
the offering and (ii) the amount of securities of the selling Holders
included in the offering be reduced below twenty percent (20%) of the total
amount of securities included in such offering. For purposes of the preceding
sentence concerning apportionment, for any selling stockholder that is
a Holder of Registrable Securities and that is a venture capital fund,
partnership or corporation, the affiliated venture capital funds, partners,
members, retired partners and stockholders of such Holder, or the estates and
Family Members of any such partners, members and retired partners and any
trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing Persons shall be deemed to be a
single "selling Holder," and any pro rata reduction with respect to such
"selling Holder" shall be based upon the aggregate amount of Registrable
Securities owned by all such related entities and individuals.

2.4 _Form S-3 Registration_. In case Parent shall receive from the Holders of
at least twenty percent (20%) of the Registrable Securities (for purposes of
this Section 2.4, the " _S-3 Initiating Holders_") a written request or
requests that Parent effect a registration on Form S-3 and any related
qualification or compliance with respect to all or a part of the Registrable
Securities owned by such Holder or Holders, Parent shall:

(a) promptly give written notice of the proposed registration, and any
related qualification or compliance, to all other Holders; and

(b) use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect, as soon as
practicable, such registration and all such qualifications and compliances as
may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and
distribution of all or such portion of such Holders Registrable Securities
as are specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the
Registrable Securities of any other Holders joining in such request as are
specified in a written

 



8

    

 request given within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such written notice
from Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to
effect any such registration, qualification or compliance, pursuant to this
Section 2.4:

(i) if Form S-3 is not available for such offering by the Holders;

(ii) if the Holders, together with the holders of any other securities of
Parent entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell
Registrable Securities and such other securities (if any) at an aggregate
price to the public (net of any underwriters discounts or commissions) of
less than $5,000,000;

 

(iii) if Parent shall furnish to all Holders requesting a registration
statement pursuant to this Section 2.4 a certificate signed by Parents Chief
Executive Officer or Chairman of the Board stating that in the good faith
judgment of the Board, it would be seriously detrimental to Parent and its
stockholders for such registration statement to be effected at such time,
in which event Parent shall have the right to defer such filing for a period
of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request of the S-3
Initiating Holders; _provided_ that such right shall be exercised by Parent
not more than once in any twelve (12) month period;

(iv) if Parent has, within the twelve (12) month period preceding the date of
such request, already effected two (2) registrations on Form S-3 pursuant to
this Section 2.4;

 

(v) in any particular jurisdiction in which Parent would be required to
qualify to do business or to execute a general consent to service of process
in effecting such registration, qualification or compliance;

(vi) if Parent, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request of such S-3
Initiating Holders, gives notice of its bona fide intention to effect the
filing of a registration statement with the SEC within one hundred twenty
(120) days of receipt of such request (other than an Excluded Registration),
_provided_ that Parent is actively employing in good faith its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective;
or

 

(vii) during the period starting with the date thirty (30) days prior to
Parents good faith estimate of the date of the filing of and ending on the
date ninety (90) days following the effective date of a Parent-initiated
registration subject to Section 2.3 of this Agreement, _provided_ that Parent
is actively employing in good faith its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such registration statement to become effective.

(c) If the S-3 Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable
Securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so
advise Parent as a part of their request made pursuant to this Section 2.4 and
Parent shall include such information in the written notice referred to in
Section 2.4(a). The provisions of Section 2.2(b) of this

 



9

    

 Agreement shall be applicable to such request (with the substitution of
Section 2.4 for references to Section 2.2).

 

(d) Subject to the foregoing, Parent shall file a registration statement
covering the Registrable Securities and other securities so requested to be
registered as soon as practicable after receipt of the request or requests of
the S-3 Initiating Holders. Registrations effected pursuant to this Section
2.4 shall not be counted as requests for registration effected pursuant to
Section 2.2 of this Agreement.

2.5 _Obligations of_ _Parent_. Whenever required under this Section 2 to
effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, Parent shall, as
expeditiously as reasonably possible:

(a) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to
such Registrable Securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such registration statement to become effective, and, upon the request
of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities registered
thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for a period of up to
one hundred twenty (120) days (except, in the case of the Resale Registration
Statement, for such period of time specified in Section 2.1) or, if earlier,
until the distribution contemplated in the registration statement has been
completed;

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such
registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such
registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of
the Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such
registration statement;

(c) furnish to the Holders such number of copies of a prospectus, including a
preliminary prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus, in conformity with the
requirements of the Act, and such other documents as they may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities owned
by them;

(d) use its commercially reasonable efforts to register and qualify the
securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities
or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the
Holders, _provided_ that Parent shall not be required in connection therewith
or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general
consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions;

(e) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform
its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form,
with the managing underwriter of such offering;

 

(f) notify each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement at any time when a prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus (to the
extent prepared by or on behalf of Parent) relating thereto is required to be
delivered under the Act of the happening of any event as a result of which the
prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in
effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then
existing, and, at the request of any such Holder,

 



10

    

 Parent will, as soon as reasonably practicable, file and furnish to all such
Holders a supplement or amendment to such prospectus or Free Writing
Prospectus (to the extent prepared by or on behalf of Parent) so that, as
thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such
prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
light of the circumstances under which they were made;

(g) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Section
2 to be listed on a national exchange or trading system and on each securities
exchange and trading system on which similar securities issued by Parent are
then listed;

 

(h) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
registered pursuant to this Agreement and a CUSIP number for all such
Registrable Securities, in each case not later than the effective date of such
registration;

(i) promptly make available for inspection by the selling Holders, any
managing underwriter(s) participating in any disposition pursuant to such
registration statement, and any attorney or accountant or other agent retained
by any such underwriter or selected by the selling Holders, all financial and
other pertinent records, pertinent corporate documents, and properties of
Parent, and cause Parents officers, directors, employees, and independent
accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant, or agent, in each case, as
necessary or advisable to verify the accuracy of the information in such
registration statement and to conduct appropriate due diligence in connection
therewith;

 

(j) notify each selling Holder, promptly after Parent receives notice thereof,
of the time when such registration statement has been declared effective or a
supplement to any prospectus forming a part of such registration statement has
been filed; and

(k) after such registration statement becomes effective, notify each selling
Holder of any request by the SEC that Parent amend or supplement such
registration statement or prospectus.

 

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2, Parent shall be entitled to
postpone or suspend, for a reasonable period of time, the filing,
effectiveness or use of, or trading under, any registration statement if
Parent shall determine that any such filing or the sale of any securities
pursuant to such registration statement would in the good faith judgment of
the Board:

 

(i) materially impede, delay or interfere with any material pending or
proposed financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other similar
transaction involving Parent for which the Board has authorized negotiations;

(ii) materially and adversely impair the consummation of any pending or
proposed material offering or sale of any class of securities by Parent; or

(iii) require disclosure of material nonpublic information that, if disclosed
at such time, would be materially harmful to the interests of Parent and its
stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that during any such period all
executive officers and directors 

 



11

    

 of Parent are also prohibited from selling securities of Parent (or any
security of any of Parents subsidiaries or affiliates).

 

In the event of the suspension of effectiveness of any registration statement
pursuant to this Section 2.5, the applicable time period during which such
registration statement is to remain effective shall be extended by that number
of days equal to the number of days the effectiveness of such registration
statement was suspended.

 

2.6 _Information from Holder_. It shall be a condition precedent to the
obligations of Parent to take any action pursuant to this Section 2 with
respect to the Registrable Securities of any selling Holder that such Holder
shall furnish to Parent such information regarding itself, the Registrable
Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of
such securities as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of
such Holders Registrable Securities.

2.7 _Expenses of Registration_. All expenses other than underwriting
discounts and commissions incurred in connection with registrations, filings
or qualifications pursuant to Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, all registration, filing and
qualification fees, printers and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of
counsel for Parent and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel
for the selling Holders (not to exceed $50,000) shall be borne by Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to pay for any
expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to Section 2.1, Section
2.2 or Section 2.3 of this Agreement if the registration request
is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities to be registered (in which case all participating
Holders shall bear such expenses pro rata based upon the number of Registrable
Securities that were to be included in the withdrawn registration) unless, in
the case of a registration requested under Section 2.1 or Section 2.2 of this
Agreement, the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities agree to
forfeit their right to one demand registration pursuant to Section 2.1 or
Section 2.2 of this Agreement, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
at the time of such withdrawal, the Holders have learned of a material adverse
change in the condition, business or prospects of Parent from that known to
the Holders at the time of their request and have withdrawn the request with
reasonable promptness following disclosure by Parent of such material adverse
change, then the Holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses
and shall retain their rights pursuant to Sections 2.1, Section 2.2 and 2.3 of
this Agreement.

 

2.8 _Delay of Registration_. No Holder shall have any right to obtain or seek
an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any such registration as the
result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation
or implementation of this Section 2\.

 

2.9 _Indemnification_. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in
a registration statement under this Section 2:

 

(a) To the extent permitted by law, Parent will indemnify and hold harmless
each Holder, the partners, members, officers, directors, managers and
stockholders of each Holder, legal counsel and accountants for each Holder,
any underwriter (as defined in the Act) for such Holder and each Person, if
any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within the 

 



12

    

 meaning of the Act or the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the Act,
the 1934 Act, any state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated
under the Act, the 1934 Act or any state securities laws, insofar as such
losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether
commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively, a "
_Violation_ "): (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus, or Free Writing Prospectus contained therein or
any amendments or supplements thereto, any issuer information (as defined in
Rule 433 under the Act) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule
433(d) under the Act or any other document incident to such registration
prepared by or on behalf of Parent or used or referred to by Parent, (ii) the
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated in such
registration statement, or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by Parent of the Act,
the 1934 Act, any state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated
under the Act, the 1934 Act or any state securities laws, and Parent will
reimburse each such Holder, underwriter, controlling Person or other
aforementioned Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim,
damage, liability, action or proceeding as such expenses are incurred;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnity agreement contained in this
Section 2.9(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such
loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding if such settlement is
effected without the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), nor shall Parent be liable in any such case for any
such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding to the extent that
it arises out of or is based upon a Violation that occurs in reliance upon,
and in conformity with, written information furnished expressly for use in
connection with such registration by any such Holder, underwriter,
controlling Person or other aforementioned Person.

(b) To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder, severally and not
jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless Parent, each of its directors, each
of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each Person, if
any, who controls Parent within the meaning of the Act, legal counsel and
accountants for Parent, any underwriter, any other Holder selling securities
in such registration statement and any controlling Person of any such
underwriter or other Holder, against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing Persons may
become subject, under the Act, the 1934 Act, any state securities laws or any
rule or regulation promulgated under the Act, the 1934 Act or any state
securities laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the
extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder expressly
for use in connection with such registration; and each such Holder will
reimburse any Person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this Section
2.9(b) for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Person in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability, action or proceeding as such expenses are incurred; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 2.9(b)
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage,
liability, action or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the
consent of the Holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and
_provided_ that in no event shall any indemnity under this Section 2.9(b)
exceed the net

 



13

    

 proceeds from the offering received by such Holder, except in the case of
fraud or willful misconduct by such Holder.

 

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 2.9 of
notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any
governmental action or proceeding) for which a party may be entitled to
indemnification, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is
to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 2.9, deliver
to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and
the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and, to the
extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying
party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually
satisfactory to the parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that an indemnified
party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be represented
without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one (1)
separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying
party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by
the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party
represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written
notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the
commencement of any such action or proceeding, if prejudicial to its ability
to defend such action or proceeding, shall relieve such indemnifying party of
liability to the indemnified party under this Section 2.9 to the extent of
such prejudice, but the omission to so deliver written notice to the
indemnifying party will not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability
that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section
2.9.

 

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.9 is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with
respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein,
then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party
hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified
party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand in
connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no contribution by any
Holder, when combined with any amounts paid by such Holder pursuant to
Section 2.9(b), shall exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by
such Holder and (ii) no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) will be entitled to contribution
from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; and
_provided_ _further_ that in no event shall a Holders liability pursuant to
this Section 2.9(d), when combined with the amounts paid or payable by such
Holder pursuant to Section 2.9(b), exceed the proceeds from the offering
received by such Holder (net of any expenses paid by such Holder). The
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying
party or by the indemnified party and the parties relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on
indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement
entered into in

 



14

    

 connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the
foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall
control.

 

(f) The obligations of Parent and Holders under this Section 2.9 shall survive
the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration
statement under this Section 2 and otherwise.

2.10 _Reports Under the 1934 Act_. With a view to making available to the
Holders the benefits of Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the SEC
that may at any time permit a Holder to sell securities of Parent to the
public without registration or pursuant to a registration on Form S-3, Parent
agrees to:

(a) make and keep adequate current public information available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144, at all times after the
effective date of the Merger;

(b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents
required of Parent under the Act and the 1934 Act; and

(c) furnish to any Holder, so long as the Holder owns any Registrable
Securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by Parent that it
has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 (at any time
beginning ninety (90) days prior to the one year anniversary of the closing
of the Merger), the Act and the 1934 Act (at any time after it has become
subject to such reporting requirements), or that it qualifies as a registrant
whose securities may be resold pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after it so
qualifies), (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of
Parent and such other reports and documents so filed by Parent and (iii) such
other information as may be reasonably requested to avail any Holder of any
rule or regulation of the SEC that permits the selling of any such securities
without registration or pursuant to such form.

 

2.11 _Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to cause Parent to
register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2 may be assigned
(but only with all related obligations) by a Holder to a transferee or
assignee of such securities that (a) is an Affiliate, subsidiary, parent,
partner, limited partner, retired partner, member or stockholder of a
Holder, (b) is a Holders Family Member or trust for the benefit of an
individual Holder or any of such Holders Family Members, or (c) after such
assignment or transfer, holds at least 5,000,000 shares of Registrable
Securities (appropriately adjusted for any stock split, dividend, combination
or other recapitalization), _provided_ : (i) Parent is, within a reasonable
time after such transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and
address of such transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to
which such registration rights are being assigned; (ii) such transferee or
assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions
of Section 2.13 of this Agreement; and (iii) such assignment shall be
effective only if immediately following such transfer the further disposition
of such securities by the transferee or assignee is restricted under the Act.

2.12 _Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights_. From and after the date
of this Agreement, the Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Holders holding a

 



15

    

 majority of the Registrable Securities then held by all Holders, enter into
any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the
Parent other than a Permitted Registration Rights Agreement that would allow
such holder or prospective holder (a) to include any of such securities in any
registration filed under Section 2.1, Section 2.2, Section 2.3 or Section 2.4
of this Agreement, unless under the terms of such agreement, such holder or
prospective holder may include such securities in any such registration only
to the extent that the inclusion of such securities will not reduce the amount
of the Registrable Securities of the Holders that are included or (b) to
demand registration of their securities.

2.13 _"_ _Market  Stand-Off_ _"_ _Agreement_.

(a) Each Holder hereby agrees that it will not, without the prior written
consent of the Parent, during the period commencing on the date of the closing
of the Merger (the " _Closing Date_ ") and ending on the date that is one
hundred eighty (180) days after the closing of the Merger (i) lend, offer,
pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase,
purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to
purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any
shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Common Stock issued or issuable to such Holder pursuant to
the Merger Agreement (collectively, the " _Lock-Up Shares_"), or (ii) enter
into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in
part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Lock-Up Shares,
whether any such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be
settled by delivery of Common Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Holder may transfer its Lock-Up Shares
(i) as a bona fide gift or gifts, (ii) to any member of such Holders
immediate family or to any trust or other entity controlled or managed, or
under common control or management, by such Holder or the immediate family of
such Holder, of if such Holder is a trust or other similar entity, to a
trustor or beneficiary or similar person of the trust or other entity or to
the estate of a beneficiary or similar person of such trust or other entity,
(iii) upon death or by will, testamentary document or the laws of intestate
succession, (iv) if such Holder is a corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, trust or other business entity, (A) to another corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, trust or other business entity that
is an affiliate (as defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended) of such Holder, or to any investment fund or other entity
controlling, controlled by, managing or managed by or under common control
with such Holder or affiliates of such Holder (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, where such Holder is a partnership, to its general partner or a
successor partnership or fund, or any other funds managed by such
partnership), or (B) as part of a distribution, transfer or disposition
without consideration by such Holder to its stockholders, partners, members or
other equity holders, (v) to Parent in connection with the "net" or "cashless"
exercise or settlement of warrants or stock options, restricted stock units
or other equity awards (and any transfer to Parent necessary to generate such
amount of cash needed for the payment of taxes, including estimated taxes, due
as a result of such vesting, settlement or exercise whether by means of a
"net settlement" or otherwise), (vi) to Parent in connection with the
repurchase of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to equity awards granted
under a stock incentive plan or other equity award plan or pursuant to the
agreements under which such shares were issued, provided that such repurchase
of shares of Common Stock is in connection with the termination of such

 



16

    

 Holders service provider relationship with Parent, (vii) pursuant to a
final qualified domestic order or in connection with a divorce settlement or
(viii) pursuant to a _bona fide_ third-party tender offer, merger,
consolidation or other similar transaction that is approved by the Board of
Directors of Parent and made to all holders of Parents capital stock
involving a Change of Control of Parent, provided that in the event that such
tender offer, merger, consolidation or other similar transaction is not
completed, such Holders Lock-Up Shares shall remain subject to the provisions
of this Agreement; provided, however, in the case of clauses (i), (ii),
(iii), (iv) and (vii) above, it shall be a condition to the transfer or
distribution that the donee, devisee, transferee or distributee, as the case
may be, agrees in writing to be bound by the restrictions set forth in this
section (or a substantially similar written agreement), and there shall be no
further transfer of such Lock-Up Shares except in accordance with this
Agreement.

 

(c) Any discretionary waiver or termination of the restrictions herein by
Parent shall apply to all Holders subject to such agreements pro rata based
on the number of shares subject to such agreements; provided, however, that
such pro rata release shall not be required in the event that (i) a waiver or
termination is granted in connection with the registration or public
offering of securities pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, (ii) (A) the release or
waiver is effected solely to permit a transfer not for consideration and (B)
the transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by the same terms described
in this Agreement to the extent and for the duration that such terms remain in
effect at the time of the transfer or (iii) the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock subject to releases or waivers granted during the lock-up period
represent less than or equal to 1% of the total number of outstanding Common
Stock (determined as of the date of the Closing Date). Each Holder further
agrees that it will not during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date exercise any
registration rights with respect to any shares of Common Stock or any
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock;
provided however this Section 2.13(c) shall not apply to any termination
pursuant to Section 2.13(d) of the restrictions set forth in Section 2.13(a).

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time beginning 90 days after the
Closing Date (the " _Earliest Release Date_ "), the closing price of the
Common Stock equals or exceeds 133% of the closing price per share of Common
Stock on the Closing Date (as adjusted for stock splits, reverse splits,
recapitalizations, reorganizations and any similar transaction) for any 10
trading days within any 20 trading day period (with the calculation including
the 20 trading day period immediately prior to the Earliest Release Date),
then 25% of each Holders Lock-Up Shares (which, for purposes of holders of
options, shall only include options that have vested as of such date) will be
automatically released from such restrictions as of the last day of such 20
trading day period. The percentage of Lock-Up Shares to be released pursuant
to this Section 2.13(d) shall be calculated based on the number of a Holders
Lock-Up Shares as of the last day of such 20 trading day period.

(e) In order to enforce the foregoing covenant, Parent may impose stop-
transfer instructions with respect to the Registrable Securities of each
Holder (and the shares or securities of every other Person subject to the
foregoing restriction) until the end of such period.

 



17

    

(f) Each Holder agrees that a legend reading substantially as follows shall be
placed on all certificates representing all Registrable Securities of each
Holder (and the shares or securities of every other Person subject to the
restriction contained in this Section 2.13):

 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO A LOCK-UP
PERIOD, AS SET FORTH IN AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE ORIGINAL
HOLDER OF THESE SECURITIES, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED AT THE ISSUERS
PRINCIPAL OFFICE. SUCH LOCK-UP PERIOD IS BINDING ON TRANSFEREES OF THESE
SHARES. 

2.14 _Termination of Registration Rights_. No Holder shall be entitled to
exercise any right provided for in this Section 2: (a) after five (5) years
following the consummation of the Merger, (b) as to any Holder, such earlier
time after the offering at which such Holder (i) can sell all shares held by
it in compliance with Rule 144(b)(1)(i) or (ii) holds one percent (1%) or
less of Parents outstanding Common Stock and all Registrable Securities held
by such Holder (together with any Affiliate of the Holder with whom such
Holder must aggregate its sales under Rule 144) can be sold in any three (3)
month period without registration in compliance with Rule 144 or (c) after the
consummation of a Change of Control.

 

3\. _Covenants of_ _Parent_.

 

3.1 _Confidentiality_. Each Investor agrees, severally and not jointly, that
such Investor (a) will keep confidential, (b) will not disclose, divulge or
use for any purpose (other than to monitor its investment in the Company or
Parent (the "Disclosing Party") or for any other purpose contemplated by an
agreement between the Disclosing Party and such Investor or any Affiliate

jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an
ambiguity or question

 



20

will arise favoring or disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

other section or sections hereunder, the amendment or waiver of which would
adversely affect the rights of Oaktree Acquisition Holdings, L.P., shall be
effective without the written consent of Oaktree Acquisition Holdings, L.P.;
provided however that, with respect to Section 2.13, such right will expire
when Oaktree Acquisition Holdings, L.P. (or its assignees) holds less than 1%
of the shares of Common Stock held by Oaktree Acquisition Holdings, L.P.
immediately after completion of the Merger (such number of shares, the
"Requisite Shares"). Upon the dissolution of Oaktree Acquisition Holdings,
