date hereof (or such later date as the parties may mutually agree in writing), Merger Subsidiary shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act) the Offer. Merger Subsidiary&#146;s obligation to accept for payment and pay for
any Company Shares tendered in the Offer shall be subject to the condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, immediately prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended hereunder)
