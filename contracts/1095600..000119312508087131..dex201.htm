7 ARTICLE 2

THE OFFER

Section 2.01 _. The Offer._ (a) _Provided_ that nothing shall have occurred
that, had the Offer been commenced, would give rise to a right to terminate
the Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ hereto, as
promptly as practicable and in any event within ten days after the date
hereof (or such later date as the parties may mutually agree in writing),
Merger Subsidiary shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
1934 Act) the Offer. Merger Subsidiarys obligation to accept for payment and
pay for any Company Shares tendered in the Offer shall be subject to the
condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of
the Offer, immediately prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it
may be extended hereunder) and not withdrawn, a number of Company Shares
that, together with the Company Shares then directly or indirectly owned by
Parent, represents at least a majority of all Company Shares then outstanding
(the "Minimum Condition") and the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_.
Merger Subsidiary expressly reserves the right to waive any of the conditions
to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the
Offer; _provided_ that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or
previously approved by the Company in writing, (i) the Minimum Condition may
not be waived, (ii) no change may be made that changes the form of
consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer, decreases the Offer Price or
the number of Company Shares sought in the Offer or imposes conditions to the
Offer in addition to those set forth in _Annex I_ , or amends the conditions
set forth in _Annex I_ in any manner materially adverse to the holders of
Company Shares, and (iii) the Offer may not be extended except as set forth
in this Section 2.01(a). Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, unless the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
date that is 21 Business Days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with
Section 14d-1(g)(3) under the 1934 Act) after the date that the Offer is
commenced. Unless this Agreement or the Offer is terminated in accordance
with its terms, Merger Subsidiary shall extend the Offer from time to time (1)
if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, the Minimum
Condition or any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in clause (I)(B) of
the first paragraph of Annex I shall not have been satisfied or waived, from
time to time, until the earliest to occur of (x) the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions and (y) the End Date, and (2) for any period required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer or any period required by Applicable Law; _provided_
that Merger Subsidiary shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the
End Date. Following expiration of the Offer, Merger Subsidiary may, in its
sole discretion, provide a subsequent offering period ("Subsequent Offering
Period") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the 1934 Act. Subject to
the foregoing, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer,
Merger Subsidiary shall accept for payment and pay for (A) as promptly as
practicable, all Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer, promptly after the final expiration of the Offer, and (B) all
Company Shares validly tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period, promptly
after such Company Shares are validly tendered. The Offer Price payable in
respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer or validly tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period shall be paid
net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction for any applicable
withholding Taxes.

(b) As soon as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") that
shall include as exhibits or incorporated by reference thereto, the Offer to
Purchase and forms of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, if any,
in respect of the Offer (collectively, together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"), and (ii) cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares. The Company
shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Subsidiary in writing all
information concerning the Company that may be required by applicable
securities laws or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Subsidiary for
inclusion in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree to take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be  



 

8  disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time before any such document is
filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel.
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall provide the Company and its counsel with
(A) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications, and (B) a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to
which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by
participating with Parent and Merger Subsidiary or their counsel in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC.

Section 2.02. _Company Action_. (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer
and represents that at a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution
of this Agreement at which all directors of the Company were present, the
Company Board duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) declaring that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Companys
stockholders, (ii) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in
accordance with the requirements of the Delaware Law, and (iii) recommending
that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Company
Shares to Merger Subsidiary pursuant to the Offer and, if applicable, vote
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (such recommendation, the "Board
Recommendation"). The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the
foregoing determinations and approvals in the Offer Documents and, to the
extent that no Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred in
accordance with Section 7.03(b), the Company hereby consents to the inclusion
of the Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. As of the date hereof, the
Company has been advised that all of its directors and executive officers who
own Company Shares intend to tender their Company Shares pursuant to the
Offer. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with a list of its
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Company Shares and
lists of securities positions of Company Shares held in stock depositories, in
each case true and complete as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists
of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer.

(b) As soon as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, the Company
shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Company Shares, in each
case, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities
laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject to
Section 7.03(b), shall reflect the Board Recommendation. Each of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all
information concerning Parent and Merger Subsidiary that may be required by
applicable securities laws or reasonably requested by the Company for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use
in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect. The Company agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC
and to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. Parent and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel. The Company shall provide Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and their counsel with (i) any comments or
other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Subsidiary
or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications, and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
Companys response to those comments and to provide comments on that response
(to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including
by participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions or
meetings with the SEC.



 

9 Section 2.03. _Directors_. (a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment of
any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance Time"), Parent
shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, on the Company Board that equals the product of (x) the total
number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the election of
any additional directors pursuant to this Section), and (y) the percentage
that the number of Company Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger
Subsidiary (including Company Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total
number of Company Shares outstanding, and the Company shall take all action
necessary to cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the
Company Board, including increasing the number of directors, and seeking and
accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, the Company
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law take all action
necessary to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number
of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the
Company Board and (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the
Company (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage
as such individuals represent on the Company Board, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. In the event that Parents
designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board pursuant to this
Section 2.03(a), until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at
least such number of directors as may be required by the rules and regulations
of Nasdaq or the federal securities laws who are considered independent
directors within the meaning of such rules and laws (each, a "Continuing
Director", and together, the "Continuing Directors"), provided however, that
if the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below the number of
directors as may be required by such rules and laws for any reason, the
remaining Continuing Directors shall be entitled to designate persons to fill
such vacancies with persons who shall be deemed Continuing Directors for
purposes of this Agreement, or if no Continuing Director then remains, the
other directors shall designate such number of directors as may be required by
the rules and laws to fill such vacancies and who shall not be stockholders in
or Affiliates of the Parent, and such persons shall be deemed
Continuing Directors for purposes hereof.

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and
its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section. Parent shall supply to the
Company in writing any information with respect to itself and its nominees,
officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant
to Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority
of the Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize (and such
authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no
other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other
director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) (i) any amendment or
termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any decrease in or change
of form of the Merger Consideration, (iii) any extension of time for the
performance of any of the obligations of Merger Subsidiary or Parent
hereunder, (iv) any waiver of compliance with the performance of any
obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Subsidiary for the benefit
of the Company or any waiver of any right of the Company under this Agreement,
(v) any amendment to the certificate of incorporation of the Company or bylaws
of the Company or (vi) any other action or consent by the Company or the
Company Board with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated hereby.

Section 2.04 _. 90% Top-Up Option._ (a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants
to Merger Subsidiary the option (the "90% Top-Up Option"), exercisable from
time to time upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2.04, to
purchase that number of Company Shares (the "90% Top-Up Option Shares") equal
to the lowest number of Company Shares that, when added to the number of
Company Shares directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of such
exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the Company Shares then
outstanding (taking into account the issuance of the 90% Top-Up Option Shares)
at a price per share equal to the Offer Price (which price may be paid in cash
or with a promissory note issued by Parent bearing interest at the rate that
will cause the promissory note to be equal to the face value of the promissory
note and which shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution
and delivery of such promissory note);  _provided_ that in  



 

10  no event shall the 90% Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Company
Shares in excess of the Companys then authorized and unissued shares
of Company Common Stock (giving effect to Company Shares reserved for
issuance under the Company Stock Plans as if such shares were outstanding).

(b) Merger Subsidiary may exercise the 90% Top-Up Option, in whole but not in
part, at any time after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur
of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms. In the event that Merger Subsidiary wishes to
or is required to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Subsidiary shall deliver
to the Company a notice setting forth (i) the number of shares of Company
Shares that Merger Subsidiary intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up
Option, (ii) the aggregate cash consideration payable, and (iii) the place and
time at which the closing of the sale of such Company Shares shall take place.
At the closing of the purchase Merger Subsidiary shall cause to be delivered
to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the
Company Shares and the Company shall cause to be delivered to Merger
Subsidiary a certificate for the Company Shares. In the event Merger
Subsidiary exercises the Top-Up Option pursuant to this Section 2.04(b), the
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares shall occur within three
Business Days.

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge that the Company Shares which
Merger Subsidiary may acquire upon exercise of the 90% Top-Up Option will
not be registered under the 1933 Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Merger Subsidiary represent and warrant to the Company that Merger
Subsidiary is, or will be upon the purchase of the 90% Top-Up Option Shares,
an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
1933 Act. Merger Subsidiary agrees that the 90% Top-Up Option and the 90% Top-
Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the 90% Top-Up Option are
being and will be acquired by Merger Subsidiary for the purpose of investment
and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution
thereof (within the meaning of the 1933 Act). 

ARTICLE 3

THE MERGER

Section 3.01 _. The Closing._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place as
soon as practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days) after
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions
to the Merger set forth in Article 10 (excluding conditions that, by their
terms, are satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), unless this Agreement
has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the
offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 1600 El Camino Real, Menlo Park, California
94025, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

Section 3.02 _. The Merger._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, as soon as practicable after the Closing, the Company (or
Merger Subsidiary in the event that the Merger is effected pursuant to Section
253(a) of Delaware Law) shall file a certificate of merger or, if applicable,
a certificate of ownership and merger (the "Merger Certificate") with the
Delaware Secretary of State in such form as is required by, and executed in
accordance with, Delaware Law and make all other filings or recordings
required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the Merger Certificate
is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as is
specified in the Merger Certificate.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving  



 

11  Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises
and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions
and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under
Delaware Law.

Section 3.03. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) except as otherwise provided in Sections 3.03(b), 3.03(c) or 3.05, each
Company Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer
Price, without interest, less any applicable withholding Taxes (the "Merger
Consideration");

(b) each Company Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary (whether pursuant to the Offer or otherwise)
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto;

(c) each Company Share held by any wholly-owned (directly or indirectly)
Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger
Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
such number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage
of Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such
Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(d) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with
the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and (in
addition to shares referred to in Section 3.03(c)) shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.04 _. Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger
Consideration (i) certificates representing Company Shares (the
"Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated Company Shares (the
"Uncertificated Shares"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall pay to the
Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time,
but in no event later than ten days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of
Company Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or
transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such
exchange.

(b) Each holder of Company Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent
of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or
(ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be
properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment  



 

12  shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration paid to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 3.04(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon)
that remains unclaimed by holders of Company Shares twelve months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged such Company Shares for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 3.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such
Company Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any amounts
paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws.

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration paid to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 3.04(a) in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of Company Restricted Shares shall be
payable pursuant to Section 3.06 and not pursuant to this Section 3.04 and no
deposit shall be made with the Exchange Agent by the Company or Parent
pursuant to this Section 3.04, and the procedures of this Section 3.04 in
respect of holders of shares of Company Stock shall not apply, with respect to
such holders shares of unvested Company Restricted Shares.

Section 3.05 _. Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding Section 3.03, any Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares") held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has validly
demanded appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with Delaware Law
shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration,
unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to
appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such Company Shares shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. At the
Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of
Delaware Law and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Company Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

Section 3.06 _. Company Equity Awards._ (a) At the Effective Time, each option
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option")
outstanding under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and the 1996 Equity Incentive
Plan or any other stock option or equity compensation plan, program, agreement
or arrangement (the "Company Stock Plans") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall
be assumed and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option
to acquire shares of Parent Stock, on substantially the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option (including
vesting schedule) and any repurchase rights with respect to unvested shares
subject to such Company Stock Option shall be assigned to any successor
thereto, including Parent, except that (i) the number of shares of Parent
Stock subject to each such option shall be determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock  



 

13  Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction (the "Option
Exchange Ratio"), the numerator of which is the Offer Price and the
denominator of which is the average closing price of Parent Stock on Nasdaq
over the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not
including) the Closing Date (rounded down to the nearest whole share) and (ii)
the exercise price per share of Parent Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise price for the shares of Company
Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (y) the Option Exchange
Ratio; _provided,_ that in any event the Company Stock Options shall be
converted in a manner compliant with Section 409A of the Code (or an available
exemption therefrom) and Section 424(a) of the Code to the extent applicable
and the regulations thereunder. In the event that the foregoing assumption of
the Company Stock Options (together with any other event contemplated by this
Agreement) would require Parent to seek stockholder approval under applicable
Nasdaq rules and regulations, the number of Company Stock Options so assumed
shall be reduced on a prorated basis among all Company Stock Options, and such
non-assumed Company Stock Options shall become fully vested and exercisable
prior to the Effective Time and, to the extent not exercised prior to the
Effective Time, shall be converted into the right to receive a cash amount per
share equal to the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price
of such Company Stock Option.

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Restricted Stock Unit shall be
converted automatically into a substantially similar award for Parent Stock
and shall remain subject to the same vesting, settlement, forfeiture or
repurchase conditions in effect on the date hereof, except that the number of
shares of Parent Stock subject to each such assumed award shall be determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
award by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share.

(c) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Section
3.06, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.06.
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Stock subject to the assumed Company
Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units as soon as practicable, but in any
event within ten Business Days following the Effective Time.

(d) The Company shall cause the administrator of the Companys Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to promptly take all action necessary in
accordance with the ESPP to accelerate the Purchase Date (as defined in the
ESPP) with respect to the current offering period under the ESPP such that
each outstanding purchase right with respect to the current offering
period under the ESPP shall be exercisable no less than five Business Days
prior to the initial scheduled expiration of the Offer. The Company shall take
all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the ESPP in order to (i) ensure
that no purchase periods under the ESPP commence after the date hereof, and
(ii) terminate the ESPP prior to the Effective Time.

Section 3.07 _. Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a
record date during such period the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and
any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted.

Section 3.08 _. Withholding Rights._ Each of the Exchange Agent, Merger
Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to Article 2 or 3 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any Tax law. To
the extent that amounts so withheld are paid over to or deposited with the
relevant Taxing Authority by or on behalf of the Exchange Agent, Merger
Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Merger Subsidiary,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.



 

14 Section 3.09 _. Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated under this Article
3.

ARTICLE 4

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

Section 4.01 _. Certificate of Incorporation._ The certificate of

Applicable Law.

Section 4.02 _. Bylaws._ The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the

except as otherwise duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with
Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
and (ii) the officers of the Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Subject to Section 12.05, except as set forth in the disclosure schedule

(the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent that:

business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such

Companys annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,

complete and correct summary thereof.

Section 5.02 _. Corporate Authorization._ (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and, except for obtaining the Stockholder Approval (if

corporate action on the part of the Company. Assuming the facts set forth in
Section 6.07, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to approve and adopt this Agreement
and to approve the Merger (the "Stockholder  



 

15  Approval"), if required by Applicable Law, is the only vote of the holders
of any of the Companys capital stock necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other
similar Applicable Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

(b) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this Agreement
at which all directors of the Company were present, the Company Board duly and
unanimously adopted resolutions (i) declaring that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair
to and in the best interests of the Companys stockholders, (ii) approving and
declaring advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of the
Delaware Law, (iii) approving and adopting an amendment to the Company Rights
Agreement to render the Company Rights inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger,

contemplated hereby and thereby, and (iv) making the Board Recommendation.

Section 5.03. _Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the
filing of the Merger Certificate with the Delaware Secretary of State and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which
the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with applicable
requirements of (A) the HSR Act and (B) any Applicable Law analogous to the
HSR Act or otherwise regulating antitrust, competition or merger control
matters and in each case existing in foreign jurisdictions ("Foreign
Competition Laws"), (iii) compliance with applicable requirements of the 1933
Act, the 1934 Act and other applicable securities laws, whether federal, state
or foreign, (iv) compliance with applicable requirements of Nasdaq and (v)
actions or filings the absence of which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.04. _Non-contravention._ The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii) assuming compliance with
the matters referred to in Section 5.03, contravene, conflict with, or result
in a violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law or Order,
(iii) require any consent or action by another Person under, constitute a
default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default under, or cause or permit the termination,
cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled under, any provision of any Material Contract or any other Contract
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any
Governmental Authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets
or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation
or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) through
(iv), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ that in determining
whether a Company Material Adverse Effect would result, any adverse effect
otherwise excluded by clause (ii)(A) of the definition of "Company Material
Adverse Effect" shall be taken into account.

Section 5.05.  _Capitalization._ (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 85,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000

(b) Except, in the case of clauses (i)-(iv) below, (x) as set forth in this
Section 5.05, (y) for changes since March 31, 2008 resulting from the

(vii) obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Securities. No Company
Securities are owned by any subsidiary of the Company.

shares and type of capital stock for which the warrant is exercisable, (ii)

Each Company Warrant was granted in compliance with all Applicable Laws. 

(e) With respect to the Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units, (i)
each Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option"
under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies, (ii) each grant of a Company Stock
Option or Restricted Stock Unit was duly authorized no later than the date on
which the grant of such Company Stock Option was by its terms to be effective

practice to grant, Company Stock Options or Restricted Stock Units prior to,
or otherwise coordinate the grant of Company Stock Options and Restricted
Stock Units with, the release or other public announcement of material
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
financial results or prospects.

Section 5.06. _Subsidiaries._ (a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is an
organization duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all organizational
powers required to carry on its business as now conducted. Each such
Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All "significant subsidiaries" (as defined in
Regulation S-K under the 1934 Act; provided however that the 10% threshold
referred to in such definition shall be deemed to be 5% for the purposes of
this Agreement) of the Company and their respective jurisdictions of
organization are identified in the Companys annual report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other voting securities or
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company is owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any
other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to

commitments of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital
stock of or other voting securities or ownership interests in, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock of or other
voting securities or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company, or
(iii) restricted shares, stock appreciation rights, performance shares,
contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar securities or rights that
are derivative of, or provide economic benefits based, directly or indirectly,
on the value or price of, any capital stock of, or other voting securities or
ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses
(i)-(iii), in addition to all shares of capital stock or voting securities of
the Companys Subsidiaries, being referred to collectively as the "Company
Subsidiary Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of
the Company Subsidiary Securities.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly
owns any equity, ownership, profit, voting or similar interest in or
any interest convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity,
profit, voting or similar interest in, any Person (other than a Subsidiary of
the Company).



 

18 Section 5.07. _SEC Filings._ (a) The Company has timely filed with the SEC all
documents (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) required by
Applicable Law to be so filed by it since January 1, 2005. The Company has
delivered, or otherwise made available through the Companys filings with the
SEC, to Parent (i) the Companys annual reports on Form 10-K for its fiscal
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, (ii) its proxy or information
statements relating to meetings of, or actions taken without a meeting by, the
stockholders of the Company since December 31, 2006, and (iii) all of its
other reports, statements, schedules and registration statements filed with

this Agreement as the "Company SEC Documents")

(b) As of its filing date, each Company SEC Document complied, and each such
Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will comply, as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933
Act and the 1934 Act, as the case may be, each as in effect on its respective
filing date.

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each such Company SEC Document filed
subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the date
such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not, and each
such Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading.

(e) Each required form, report and document containing financial statements
that has been filed with or submitted to the SEC by the Company since August
29, 2002, was accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or
submitted by the Companys chief executive officer and/or chief financial
officer, as required, pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, at the time of
filing or submission of each such certification, such certification was true
and accurate and complied with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this
Agreement, no Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the 1934 Act. None of the Company, any current executive
officer of the Company or, to the Companys knowledge, any former executive
officer of the Company has received written notice from any Governmental
Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or
manner of filing of such certifications made with respect to the Company SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement.

Section 5.08. _Financial Statements; Internal Controls._ (a) The audited
consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim
financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents (i)
comply as to form, as of their respective filing dates with the SEC, in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except, in the case of unaudited statements, for the
absence of footnotes), and (iii) fairly present (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto) the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to
normal year-end adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial
statements).

(b) The Companys system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act) is reasonably
sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable assurance (i) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures
are executed in accordance with the authorization of management, and  



 

19  (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that would
materially affect the Companys financial statements. No significant
deficiency or material weakness was identified in managements assessment of
internal controls as of December 31, 2007 (nor has any such deficiency or
weakness been identified between that date and the date of this Agreement).

(c) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act) are reasonably designed to ensure
that (i) all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to the individuals
responsible for preparing such reports within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) all such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Companys management or to other individuals
responsible for preparing such reports as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company
required under the 1934 Act with respect to such reports.

(d) Since the date of their last certification with the SEC, neither the
chief executive officer nor the chief financial officer of the Company has
become aware of any fact, circumstance or change that is reasonably likely to
result in a "significant deficiency" or a "material weakness" in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

(e) The audit committee of the Company Board includes an Audit Committee
Financial Expert, as defined by Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

(f) The Company has adopted a code of ethics, as defined by Item 406(b) of
Regulation S-K, for senior financial officers, applicable to its principal
financial officer, comptroller or principal accounting officer, or persons
performing similar functions. The Company has promptly disclosed any change
in or waiver of the Companys code of ethics with respect to any such persons,
as required by Form 8-K. To the knowledge of the Company, there have been no
violations of provisions of the Companys code of ethics by any such persons.

Section 5.09. _Disclosure Documents._ (a) Each document required to be filed
by the Company with the SEC or required to be distributed or otherwise
disseminated to the Companys stockholders in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Documents"), including
the Schedule 14D-9, the proxy or information statement of the Company (the
"Proxy Statement"), if any, to be filed with the SEC for use in connection
with the solicitation of proxies from the Companys stockholders in connection
with the adoption of this Agreement and the Stockholder Meeting, and any
amendments or supplements thereto, when filed, distributed or disseminated, as
applicable, will comply as to form and substance in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the 1934 Act. 

(b) (i) The Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, at the
time such Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first
mailed to stockholders of the Company, at the time such stockholders vote on
adoption of this Agreement and at the Effective Time, and (ii) any Company
Disclosure Document (other than the Proxy Statement), at the time of the
filing of such Company Disclosure Document or any supplement or amendment
thereto and at the time of any distribution or dissemination thereof, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
representations and warranties contained in this Section 5.09(b) will not
apply to statements or omissions included in the Company Disclosure Documents
based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by Parent
specifically for use therein.

(c) The information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that the Company furnishes to Parent in writing specifically for use in the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, at the time of the filing of the  



 

20  Schedule TO, at the time of any distribution or dissemination of the Offer
Documents and at the time of the expiration of the Offer (as it may be
extended hereunder), will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Section 5.10. _Absence of Certain Changes._ (a) Since the Company Balance

Disclosure Schedule. Except as otherwise described in Section 5.20(g) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not (A) cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to be in material violation or material default under any such license,
sublicense or agreement, (B) result in the termination or modification of any
such license, sublicense or agreement, or entitle any other party to terminate
or modify such license, sublicense or agreement, (C) entitle any Person to

neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice or

other Person is or may be occurring or has or may have occurred, as a
consequence of the business activities of the Company or any of its

Property owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries or used by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in the operation of the Companys business and (ii) there is
no, nor has there been any, infringement, violation, disclosure or

Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent
and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will

and (ii) in the case of any Company Disclosure Document other than the Proxy
Statement, at the time of the filing of such Company Disclosure Document or

Proposal. Subject to Section 7.03(b), neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (A) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary the Board Recommendation or the Company
Compensation Approvals, (B) recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (C) fail to
recommend against acceptance of any Third Party tender offer or exchange
offer for the Company Shares within ten Business Days after the commencement
of such offer, (D) fail to confirm the Board Recommendation within ten
Business Days of a request from Parent to do so, provided that Parent shall
only be entitled to make such a request if and to the extent an Acquisition
Proposal shall be pending and not publicly withdrawn at the time of such
request, or (E) resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any of
the foregoing, an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
At the request of Parent, the Company shall promptly request that each Third
Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the
12-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration
of any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on
behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or analyzes that information),
and the Company  



 

36  shall provide to Parent all certifications of such return or destruction
from such other Persons as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
Board, acting directly or indirectly through any Representative, may (i)
engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that has made (and
not withdrawn) a _bona fide_ unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in writing that
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with the
Companys outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, constitutes, or is likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such Third Party non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the NDA and containing additional provisions that expressly
permit the Company to comply with the terms of this Section 7.03 (a copy of
which confidentiality agreement shall be promptly (in all events within 24
hours) provided for informational purposes to Parent), (iii) subject to
compliance with Section 7.03(c) and 7.03(d), make an Adverse Recommendation
Change, (iv) amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or
similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, but only to the extent required to
enable a Third Party to submit and allow the Company to consider an
Acquisition Proposal and the Company to accept a Superior Proposal, and/or (v)
take any non-appealable, final action that any court of competent jurisdiction
orders the Company to take, but in each case referred to in the foregoing
clauses (i) through (v), only if the Company Board determines in good faith by
a majority vote, after consulting with the Companys outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law. For purposes of this Section 7.03(b), each
reference to 15% or 85%, respectively, in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be 50%. Nothing contained herein shall prevent
the Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the
1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure
to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board, after consultation with outside counsel, disclosure is required under
Applicable Law.

(c) Neither the Company nor the Company Board shall take any of the actions
referred to in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 7.03(b), directly or
indirectly, unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent at least 24
hours prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
24 hours) after it obtains knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or any of
its Subsidiaries Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request
for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that is seeking to make
or has made after the date hereof an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party
making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal
or request. The Company shall keep Parent informed, on a prompt basis (but in
any event within 24 hours), of the status and material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, including any material amendments or proposed amendments
as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company shall provide
Parent with at least 48 hours prior notice of any meeting of the Company Board
(or such lesser notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board) at
which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with any non-public
information concerning the Companys business, present or future performance,
financial condition or results of operations, provided to any Third Party
that was not previously provided to Parent.

(d) In addition to the foregoing, the Company Board shall not make an
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless (i) the Company promptly notifies
Parent, in writing at least two full Business Days prior to taking that
action, of its intention to terminate this Agreement and to enter into a
binding definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal, attaching the
a copy of such proposed definitive agreement which shall be in final form in
all material respects and include all schedules, annexes and exhibits thereto,
and (ii) Parent does not make, within two full Business Days after its
receipt of such written notification, an offer that is determined by the
Company Board in good faith after considering the advice of its outside
counsel and of a financial advisor of nationally  



 

37  recognized reputation to be at least as favorable to the stockholders of the
Company as such Superior Proposal, it being understood that the Company
shall not enter into any such binding agreement during such two Business Day
period.

Section 7.04 _. Access to Information._ From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the NDA, the Company shall
(i) give to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the offices,
properties, books, records, Contracts, Governmental
Authorizations, documents, directors, officers and employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to Parent and its Representatives such
financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may
reasonably request, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause KPMG LLP to
furnish its work papers in respect of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
(iii) instruct its Representatives to cooperate with Parent and its
Representatives in its investigation; _provided _ that the Company may
restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any Applicable Law requires
the Company to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information, or such disclosure would, based on the advice of such partys
counsel, result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or any other applicable privilege applicable to such information. Any
investigation pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall be conducted in such manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. The parties hereto shall hold any information
obtained pursuant to this Section 7.04 in confidence to the extent set forth
in accordance with, and such information shall otherwise be subject to, the
provisions of the NDA, which shall continue in full force and effect. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
Section 7.04 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any party hereunder.

Section 7.05. _Notice of Certain Events._ (a) In connection with integration
planning with respect to the operation of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, subject to Applicable Law, the Company shall consult with Parent
on a regular basis to report material operational developments,
material developments with respect to the status of, including without
limitation the material adverse modification to, relationships with customers,
partners, suppliers, licensors, licensees, distributors and others having
material business relationships with the Company and other matters reasonably
requested by Parent.

(b) The Compan _y_ shall promptly notify Parent of:

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) any Proceeding commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
this Agreement as the case may be, or that relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iv) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be expected
to cause the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of _Annex I_ not to be
satisfied; and 

(v) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by the Company
hereunder.

Section 7.06 _. Termination of 401(k) Plan._ Unless otherwise directed in
writing by Parent at least five Business Days prior to the initial scheduled
expiration of the Offer, the Company will terminate any and all Employee Plans
intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section
401(k) of the Code, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the
date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations
(as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent. The Company shall  



 

38  provide Parent evidence that such resolutions to terminate the 401(k)
plan(s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been adopted by the Company
Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The form
and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval
of Parent. The Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent may reasonably request.
Immediately prior to such termination, the Company will make (or cause to be
made) all necessary payments to fund the contributions (i) necessary or
required to maintain the tax-qualified status of any such 401(k) Plan, (ii)
for elective deferrals made pursuant to any such 401(k) Plan for the period
prior to termination, and (iii) for employer matching contributions (if any)
for the period prior to termination.

Section 7.07. _Employee Information_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall provide to Parent a current schedule in the form maintained by its
human resources or stock administration department for internal record keeping
purposes that identifies as of the Effective Time with respect to each holder
of Company Stock Options, awarded Performance-Based Stock Units and Restricted
Stock Units with reasonable accuracy and detail, (i) the name of the holder,
(ii) the total number of shares subject to such Company Stock Option or award,
(iii) the Employee Plan under which such Company Stock Option or award was
issued, (iv) the exercise price (or purchase price, if applicable) of such
Company Stock Option or award, (v) the extent to which such Company Stock
Option or award is vested as of the Effective Time, (vi) the vesting schedule
of such Option or award, (vii) the grant date of such Company Stock Option or
award, and (viii) the expiration date of such Company Stock Option or award.

further actions (in addition to those referred to in Section 5.26(b))
reasonably requested by Parent in order to render the Company Rights
inapplicable to this Agreement, the Tender and Support Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

Section 7.09. _Company Compensation Arrangements._ Prior to the scheduled
expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended hereunder), the Company (acting
through its Compensation Committee) will take all such steps as may be
necessary or advisable to cause each Company Compensation Arrangement entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof to
be approved by the Compensation Committee (comprised solely of "independent
directors" determined in the manner described in the last sentence of Section
5.16(h)) as an Employment Compensation Arrangement and to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of
the 1934 Act.

COVENANTS OF PARENT

Parent agrees that:

Section 8.01 _. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary._ Parent shall cause Merger
Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Offer and the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Each of Parent and the Merger Subsidiary shall vote all Company
Shares acquired in the Offer or otherwise beneficially owned by it or any of
its respective Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law at the
Stockholder Meeting or otherwise.

Section 8.02 _. Director and Officer Liability. (a) _All rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement (copies of which have been made available
to Parent prior to the date hereof) shall be assumed by the  



 

39  Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the
Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to comply with and honor the foregoing obligations;
_provided_ that such obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed
from time to time under Applicable Law. For a period of six years from the
Effective Time the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and
exculpation as are contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights of the Indemnified Persons thereunder, unless such modification shall
be required by Applicable Law and then only to the extent so required.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy in effect on the

date hereof) (the "DandO Insurance Policy") covering each Indemnified Person
currently covered by the DandO Insurance Policy in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ that the Company,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor a prepaid "tail"
policy on the DandO Insurance Policy for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time or a policy of directors and officers liability insurance of
Parent, in either case, covering each such person currently covered by the DandO
Insurance Policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than the DandO Insurance Policy;  _provided_ that in satisfying its
obligation under this Section 8.02(b), the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums (or pay for a "tail" policy) in excess of
250% of the amount per annum the Company paid in respect of its current
fiscal year, which amount is set forth in Section 8.02(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the "Annual Premium Cap"); _provided further_ that if
such insurance cannot be so maintained or obtained at such cost, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation

obtained at an annual or prepaid cost equal to the Annual Premium Cap.

(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 8.02.

privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 12.04 _. Expenses._ (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such cost or expense; _provided_ that the Company and Parent
shall share equally all filing fees payable pursuant to the HSR Act or any
Foreign Competition Law.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.01(b)(iii),
11.01(c) or 11.01(d) then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer
of immediately available funds), simultaneously with the occurrence of such
termination, a fee in an amount equal to $6,000,000.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.01(b)(i) and (i)
after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination, an Acquisition
Proposal (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any new or
renewed Acquisition Proposal from any Third Party that had made an
Acquisition Proposal on or prior to the date of this Agreement) shall have
been publicly made or publicly disclosed, and (ii) within 12 months following
the date of such termination the Company shall have (A) entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to, (B) recommended to its stockholders, or
(C) consummated, an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent
(by wire transfer of immediately available funds), within one Business Day
after entering into such definitive agreement, making such recommendation or
the consummation of such transaction, a fee in an amount equal to $6,000,000;
_provided_ that in no event shall more than one fee be payable by the Company
pursuant to Section 12.04(b) and this Section 12.04(c). For purposes of this
Section 12.04(c), each reference to 15% in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be 30%, and the reference to 85% therein shall
be deemed to be 70%.

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
12.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Subsidiary would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay any amount
due to Parent pursuant to this Section 12.04, when due, the Company shall pay
the costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with
any action taken to collect payment (including the prosecution of any lawsuit
or other legal action), together with interest on the unpaid amount at the
publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in New York City from the date
such amount was first payable to the date it is paid.

applicable) of the Company that are contained in the corresponding Section of
this Agreement, and (ii) any other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in this Agreement,

shall be brought in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any
Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such Proceeding in any such court or
that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such Proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in Section 12.01 shall be deemed effective

Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.



 

46 Section 12.13 _. Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that monetary damages would
