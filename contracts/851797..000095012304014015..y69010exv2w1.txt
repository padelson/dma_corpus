         conditions specified therein; provided, however, that the amount to be
         paid to each Significant Stockholder shall be reduced by an amount
         equal to such Significant Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of the
         Indemnity Escrow Fund;

                           (iii) deliver to each of the Optionholders the amount
         to be paid to such Optionholder as determined in accordance with
         Section 2.1(d), but in each such case subject to the satisfaction of
         the conditions specified therein; and

                           (iv) deliver all other documents, including without
         limitation the Defeasance Cost Tax Note, required to be delivered by
         the Purchaser on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to this
         Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which the Purchaser is or is
         required to be a party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

                  (f) All payments to be made by the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 2.2(e)(ii) and (iii) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such bank account or bank accounts as designated by each

                  SECTION 2.3. SUBSEQUENT CHANGE OF CONTROL.

                  (a) The Purchaser agrees that if a Change of Control shall
occur within nine (9) months after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will pay,
within ten (10) Business Days after the Determination Date, to each Stockholder
and Optionholder with respect to the first such Change of Control an amount in
cash (the aggregate of which shall be considered to be additions to the Cash
Purchase Price) equal to:

                                       19

<PAGE>

                           (i) the quotient that results when (i) the number of
         shares of Common Stock surrendered by such Stockholder to the Purchaser
         pursuant hereto or the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the
         Options held by such Optionholder that are cancelled pursuant hereto,
         as applicable, is divided by (ii) the Fully Diluted Share Number,

                  is multiplied by

                           (ii) twenty percent (20%) of the amount, if any, by
         which (A) the Equity Value on such Change of Control Date is greater
         than (B) the sum of (1) the Initial Purchaser Stockholder Investments
         made on or prior to the Closing Date, plus (2) the amount of Additional
         Purchaser Stockholder Investments made from the Closing Date through
         such Change of Control Date, plus (3) the aggregate of the amounts,
         calculated like interest calculated utilizing an annual rate of
         interest equal to twenty percent (20%) on the daily amount, for each
         day occurring during the period from the Closing Date through such
         Change of Control Date, by which the sum of the amounts specified in
         clauses (1) and (2) above as of such date is greater than the Aggregate
         Purchaser Stockholder Distributions through such date.

                  (b) Not later than fifteen (15) days after the occurrence of
the first Change of Control Date, the Purchaser shall deliver to the
Representatives a calculation (the "Proposed Calculation") setting forth in
reasonable detail a calculation of the amount of the payments to be made to the
Stockholders and Optionholders pursuant to Section 2.3(a). Such statement shall
be accompanied by the Purchaser's most recent audited or unaudited financial
statements for the most recent period ended prior to or coinciding with such
Change of Control Date unless such financial statements are not relevant to the
determination of the amounts payable by the Purchaser under Section 2.3(a).

                  (c) The Representatives shall have thirty (30) days from the
date of their receipt of the Proposed Calculation to review the same. Upon
expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Representatives shall be deemed
to have accepted on behalf of all such Stockholders and Optionholders, and all
such Stockholders and Optionholders shall be bound by, the Proposed Calculation
and the Purchaser's calculation of the amounts due to the Stockholders and
Optionholders pursuant to Section 2.3(a) with respect to such Change of Control,
as applicable, unless the Purchaser has been advised in writing prior to the
expiration of such thirty (30) day period by the Representatives of their
disagreement with the Proposed Calculation (an "Objection"), specifying each of
the disputed items and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for each
such dispute (each, a "Disputed Item"). The Purchaser shall have twenty (20)
days from the date on which it receives the Objection (the "Objection Date") to
review and respond to such Objection. If the Purchaser and the Representatives
are able to negotiate a mutually agreeable resolution to each Disputed Item, and
sign a certificate to that effect, then the Proposed Calculation, as adjusted to
reflect such agreement, shall be deemed final and binding for purposes of this
Agreement. The Purchaser shall grant the Representatives access at reasonable
times and places to all books, records and employees of the Purchaser reasonably
requested by the Representatives in connection with (i) the Representatives'
review of the Proposed Calculation and (ii) the preparation of any Objection.

<PAGE>

                  (d) If the Purchaser and the Representatives are not able to
resolve all of their disagreements with respect to the Disputed Items within
thirty (30) days after the Objection Date, then the Disputed Items shall be
referred for final determination to the Accounting Referee (as defined below) to
make a final and non-appealable binding determination as to such Disputed Items.
The "Accounting Referee" shall be PricewaterhouseCoopers (the "First Choice").
If the First Choice notifies the parties that it is not available, the
Accounting Referee shall be such other independent accounting firm of national
reputation selected by the mutual agreement of the Purchaser and the
Representatives within ten (10) days of such notice of unavailability. If the
Purchaser and the Representatives cannot agree on an Accounting Referee within
such ten (10) day period, the parties (or either of them) shall request that it
shall be chosen by the First Choice and shall be a nationally recognized firm.
The Accounting Referee shall be directed to make a determination in accordance
with Section 2.3(e) below of the Disputed Items promptly, but no later than
thirty (30) days, after acceptance of its appointment. The Purchaser and the
Representatives shall make readily available to the Accounting Referee all
relevant books, records and employees of the Purchaser relating to the Proposed
Calculation and all other items reasonably requested by the Accounting Referee
in connection with the Accounting Referee's review of any Disputed Item.

                  (e) If Disputed Items are referred to the Accounting Referee
for resolution pursuant to Section 2.3(d) above, the Accounting Referee shall
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by the Purchaser or the Representatives or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by the Purchaser or the Representatives. Any finding by
the Accounting Referee shall be a reasoned award stating the findings of fact
and conclusions of law (if any) on which it is based, shall be final,
non-appealable and binding upon the parties and shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy between the parties regarding the Disputed Items so presented. The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by the Representatives and
the Purchaser in the same proportion that the dollar amount of Disputed Items
which are not resolved in favor of the Representatives or the Purchaser (as
applicable) bears to the total dollar amount of Disputed Items resolved by the
Accounting Referee. For illustration purposes only, (i) if the total amount of
Disputed Items by the Representatives is $1,000,000, and the Representatives are
awarded $500,000 by the Accounting Referee, the Representatives, on the one
hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall bear the Accounting Referee's
fees and expenses equally; or (ii) if the total amount of Disputed Items by the
Representatives is $1,000,000, and the Representatives are awarded $250,000 by
the Accounting Referee, the Representatives shall bear 75 percent and the
Purchaser shall bear 25 percent of the Accounting Referee's fees and expenses.
Each of the Purchaser and the Representatives shall bear the fees, costs and
expenses of their respective accountants and all of their other respective
expenses incurred in connection with the matters contemplated by this Section
2.3.

                  (f) The Proposed Calculation, as finally determined pursuant
to this Section 2.3, is referred to herein as the "Final Calculation." The date
upon which the Proposed Calculation, with respect to a Change of Control, is
finally determined is referred to herein as the "Determination Date" with
respect to such Change of Control.

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 3.7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATUTORY STATEMENTS.

                  (a) The Company has delivered or made available to the
Purchaser each form, registration statement, report and document prepared by it
(other than preliminary material) required to be filed by the Company with the
SEC, each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with
the SEC (collectively, the "Company Reports"). As of their respective dates,
each of the Company Reports complied and, in the case of filings after the date
hereof, will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as the
case may be, and the rules and regulations thereunder. None of the Company
Reports contained (as of their respective filing dates) any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstance under which they were made, not misleading. The Company has filed
with the SEC all forms, reports and documents required to be filed under
Sections 13, 14 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. None of the Subsidiaries is
required to file any forms, reports, schedules, statements or other documents
with the SEC.

                  (b) The Company has responded to all comment letters, if any,
received from the SEC since December 31, 2001 relating to the Company Reports
and the SEC has not asserted that any of such responses are inadequate,
insufficient or otherwise non-responsive. The Company has delivered to the
Purchaser correct and complete copies of all such comment letters and related
correspondence with the SEC occurring since December 31, 2001.

                  (c) The consolidated balance sheets of the Company and the
related statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders equity
(deficiency) included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports
and, in the case of annual financial statements, certified by Deloitte & Touche
LLP (the "Financial Statements"), (i) were prepared from and are in accordance
with the books and records of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries and
(ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and on a
consistent basis with prior periods (except as stated in such Financial
Statements). The Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at
the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows and stockholders equity (deficiency) of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim
Financial Statements were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments (which in the aggregate are not and will not be material in amount).
Except as reflected or reserved against in the Financial Statements included in
the most recent Company Report or as disclosed therein, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries had as of such date any liability of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which would be required in
accordance with GAAP to be disclosed in the Financial Statements and which, in
the aggregate, would be material. The reserves reflected on the balance sheet
included in the most recent Company Report have been calculated in accordance
with GAAP.

                  (d) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the
Company or any of the Stockholders specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Tender Offer Documents will, at the time the Offer to
Purchase first is mailed to holders of the Notes, at any

                                       25

time it is amended or supplemented or at any time prior to the expiration of the
Tender Offers, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Tender Offer Documents will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Tender Offer Documents based
on written information supplied by the Purchaser specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Tender Offer Documents.

                  SECTION 3.8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

                  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8:

                  (a) to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, own, free and clear of all Encumbrances and
exclusive licenses, all right, title and interest in and to, or have valid
written licenses to use, all the Intellectual Property that is material to the
conduct of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries;

                  (b) Schedule 3.8 sets forth a true, accurate and complete list

applications, domain name registrations and copyright applications and
registrations anywhere in the world owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries;

                  (c) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
infringements of the Intellectual Property by any third party;

                  (d) there are no claims pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened: (i) alleging that the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted infringes upon or constitutes an
unauthorized use or violation of any third party's intellectual property or
other proprietary rights; or (ii) challenging the ownership, validity or
enforceability of any of the Intellectual Property, except for such claims which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect,
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is there a reasonable basis for any such
claim; and

                  (e) Schedule 3.8 sets forth a true, accurate and complete list
of all material agreements relating to the Intellectual Property or to the right
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to use the intellectual property or
other proprietary rights of any third party. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.8, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is under any obligation to
pay royalties or other payments in connection with any agreement nor are any of
them restricted from assigning any of their rights respecting Intellectual
Property, nor will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries otherwise be, as a
result of the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Stockholders, in breach of any agreement relating to any of the Intellectual
Property, except for such royalties, payments, restrictions on assignment or
breach of agreement that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 3.9. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

                  The business of the Company and its Subsidiaries is not being
conducted in violation of any Applicable Law or any other requirement of any
Government Entity, except for those violations, if any, which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.9, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any outstanding or uncured written notice alleging any violation of any
such Applicable Law or directing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take
any remedial action with respect to any such Applicable Law and (ii) to the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts, events or conditions that may
constitute potential defaults or violations of any Applicable Law, except as
would, with respect to (i) or (ii), individually or in the aggregate, not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.10. PERMITS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES.

                  All permits, licenses, approvals, franchises, authorizations,
exemptions, classifications, registrations, and similar documents or instruments
issued by any Government Entity to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
loss, revocation, termination or expiration of which would, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, are listed on Schedule 3.10
(collectively, the "Permits"). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10, all Permits
are valid and in full force and effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with all terms required for the continued
effectiveness of each such Permit, and there is no pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened, revocation or involuntary non-renewal of any such
Permit.

                  SECTION 3.11. CONTRACTS.

                  Schedule 3.11 sets forth a true and complete list of all
Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any of their respective assets may be bound as of the date hereof. The Company
has delivered or made available to the Purchaser copies of all written Contracts
and written descriptions of all oral Contracts listed on Schedule 3.11. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary party to any Contract, nor, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any other party thereto, is in breach thereof or default
thereunder, or has given notice of breach or default to any other party
thereunder, except for such breaches or defaults as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Contract is in full
force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company or the relevant Subsidiary, as the case may be (and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, each other party thereto), subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,

or any ERISA Affiliate has any outstanding liability under Section 4062 of ERISA
to the PBGC or to a trustee appointed under Section 4042 of ERISA, and no events
have occurred and no circumstances exist that would result in any such liability
to the Company or any Subsidiary. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.15(c), in
respect of any Pension Plans (i) no Encumbrances have arisen under Section
412(n) of the Code or Section 302(f) of ERISA, (ii) no Liabilities for security
have arisen under Section 401(a)(29) of the Code and (iii) there have been no

received, has an application pending or remains within the remedial amendment
period for obtaining, a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
that it is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that its related trust
is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no facts or set of circumstances exist that would affect such
qualification or tax exemption.

                  (e) All contributions (including all employer contributions
and employee contributions) required to have been made under the Benefit Plans
or by law to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in connection
therewith have been made by the due date thereof (including any valid
extensions).

respect to the filing of applicable documents, notices or reports (including,
but not limited to, annual reports filed on Form 5500) relating to the Benefit
Plans with the Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service, or the
furnishing of any required documents to the participants or beneficiaries

                                       31

<PAGE>

of the Benefit Plans, other than violations which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (g) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.15(g), there are no
material pending actions, claims or lawsuits which have been asserted,
instituted or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Benefit
Plans, the assets of any of the trusts under the Benefit Plans or the sponsor or
the administrator of the Benefit Plans, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
against any fiduciary of the Benefit Plans with respect to the operation of the
Benefit Plans (other than routine benefit claims).

                  (h) The Benefit Plans have been maintained, in all material
respects, in accordance with their express terms and with all provisions of
ERISA and the Code (including rules and regulations thereunder) and other
applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to any
Benefit Plan has engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction," as defined in
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, or taken any actions, or
failed to take any actions, which could reasonably result in any material
liability to the Company or any Subsidiary under ERISA or the Code.

                  (i) The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with the notice and coverage continuation requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA, and the regulations
thereunder ("COBRA"). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.15(i), none of the
Benefit Plans provide retiree health or life insurance benefits except as may be
required by COBRA (or any applicable state law) or at the expense of the
participant or the participant's beneficiary.

                  (j) Except as required by Applicable Law or as disclosed on
Schedule 3.15(j), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries provides any
post-employment welfare benefits.

                  SECTION 3.16. LABOR RELATIONS AND EMPLOYMENT.

                  (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.16, as of the date

nor any of its Subsidiaries has any pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, any lawsuit, claim, administrative proceeding, arbitration or
governmental investigation relating to any wage and hour claim, unfair labor

Knowledge of the Company, there is no basis for such lawsuit, claim, proceeding
or investigation.

and subject to general principles of equity. Except as set forth on Schedule

estates in the Leased Real Property that is necessary for the conduct of

institution of suspension or debarment proceedings against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has, within the past
five years, been terminated for default under any Government Contract.

revocations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

                  Except as required under the HSR Act or any competition law or

their terms, do not require the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to obtain any
consent or approval of, make any filing with, or give any notice to, any
Government Entity, except for such consents, approvals, filings or notices the
failure to obtain, make or give which, as the case may be, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 5.6. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

                  Except for those violations, if any, which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, the
Purchaser is not in violation of any Applicable Law or any other requirement of
any Government Entity. The Purchaser has not received any written notice from
any Government Entity alleging any violation of any such Applicable Law or
directing the Purchaser to take any remedial action with respect to such law,
ordinance or regulation, in either case which would have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 5.7. FINANCING.

                  The Purchaser has delivered to the Company complete and
correct executed copies of the documents listed in Part I of Exhibit D and all
other letters, agreements and other documents (collectively, the "Debt Financing
Documents") issued to the Purchaser or to which the Purchaser is a party in
connection with the debt financing of the Subject Transactions (the
"Financing"). The Purchaser has also delivered to the Company complete and
correct executed

                                       41

<PAGE>

copies of the documents listed in Part II of Exhibit D and all other letters,
agreements and other documents (collectively, the "Equity Financing Documents"
and collectively with the Debt Financing Documents, the "Financing Documents")
issued to the Purchaser or to which the Purchaser is a party in connection with
the equity financing for the Subject Transactions (the "Equity Investment"). The
Financing Documents are in full force and effect, are not subject to any
conditions other than those contained therein, and have not been amended or
modified in any respect, all commitment fees required to be paid thereunder have
been paid in full or will be duly paid in full when due, and no event has
occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute
a default thereunder on the part of the Purchaser or the Finance Parties, as the
case may be. There are no facts and circumstances known to the Purchaser or its
Affiliates that any of them believes or has reason to believe is reasonably
likely to (i) prevent the conditions described in the Financing Documents from
being satisfied, (ii) prevent the Purchaser from receiving financing pursuant to
the terms of the Financing Documents or (iii) make any of the conditions or
assumptions set forth in the Financing Documents unreasonable. The Finance
Parties have not advised the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of any facts
which cause them to believe the financing contemplated by the Financing
Documents will not be consummated substantially in accordance with the terms
thereof. Assuming satisfaction of all applicable conditions set forth in the
Debt Financing Documents, at the Closing Date, the Purchaser will be capitalized
with the Equity Investment, which, together with the proceeds from the Financing
and available cash of the Purchaser, will provide sufficient funds to consummate
the Subject Transactions.

                  SECTION 5.8. SOPHISTICATED INVESTOR.

                  The Purchaser is a sophisticated investor, represented by
independent legal and investment counsel with experience in the acquisition and
valuation of ongoing businesses and acknowledges that it has received, or has
had access to, all information which it considers necessary or advisable to
enable it to make an informed investment decision concerning its purchase of the
Common Stock. The Purchaser is acquiring the Common Stock for investment
purposes only, and not with a view to, or for, any public resale or other
distribution thereof. The Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as such term is
defined in the regulations promulgated under the Securities Act.

                  SECTION 5.9. OTHER INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS.

                  The Purchaser acknowledges that (i) the Purchaser and its
employees, agents and accounting and legal representatives have been afforded
access to the books, records, key personnel, facilities and other information
related to the Common Stock and the business and affairs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (ii) the Purchaser and its employees, agents and accounting and
legal representatives have been given an opportunity to ask questions relating
to the Common Stock and the business and affairs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and to receive answers thereto; (iii) the Purchaser has performed
such due diligence as the Purchaser deemed necessary in order to review and
assess the properties, business and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in connection with its acquisition of the Common Stock (including the matters
set forth in the Schedules attached hereto); and (iv) each of the Finance
Parties has similarly been afforded access to information and conducted such due
diligence as such Finance Parties required. In completing the Subject
Transactions, the Purchaser has not and is not relying

                                       42

<PAGE>

on any representation or warranty, whether by any Stockholder, the Company or
any other Person, which is not expressly set forth in this Agreement. The
Purchaser understands that no party hereto nor any Affiliates, representatives
or agents of any party is making any representation or warranty whatsoever, oral
or written, express or implied, other than as set forth in this Agreement, and
the Purchaser is not relying on any statement, representation or warranty, oral
or written, express or implied, made by another party hereto, such other party's
Affiliates, representatives or agents, or any other Person, except as set forth
in this Agreement.

                  SECTION 5.10. BROKERS.

                  No broker, investment bank, finder, financial adviser or other
person has acted as such for, or is entitled to any compensation from, the
Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the Subject
Transactions, except as set forth on Schedule 5.10.

                  SECTION 5.11. INFORMATION SUPPLIED.

                  None of the written information supplied or to be supplied by
the Purchaser specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Tender Offer Documents will, at the time the Offer to Purchase first is mailed
to holders of the Notes, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at any
time prior to the expiration of the Tender Offers, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

                                   ARTICLE VI.

                                    COVENANTS

                  SECTION 6.1. CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS PENDING THE CLOSING.

                  The Company will not, and the Company will not permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, take any action with the purpose of causing any of the
conditions to the Purchaser's obligations set forth in Article VII hereof to not
be satisfied. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, as set forth on Schedule
6.1 or with the prior written consent of the Purchaser, during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the Closing, the Company will, and will cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, conduct their respective businesses according to their
ordinary and usual course of business and to use all commercially reasonable
efforts consistent therewith (x) to preserve intact their respective material
properties, assets and business organizations and (y) to maintain satisfactory
relationships with material customers, suppliers, distributors, regulators,
creditors and others having business relationships with the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case in the ordinary course of business; provided,
however, that none of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be required to incur
any costs or expenses or otherwise expend any monies out of the ordinary course
of business in connection with such efforts. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company
will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed):

         for payment or pay any dividend or distribution, payable in cash,

         direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary to the Company or another
         direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary;

         merger, consolidation, liquidation or business combination involving
         the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any acquisition or
         disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or securities of
         the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

                           (iv) propose or adopt any amendment to the

                  The Stockholders and the Company agree that between the date

(B) to enter into any merger, consolidation or other business combination

detail the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or
contact and the terms and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or other
contact. The Stockholders and the Company agree not to, and to cause each of the

                  SECTION 6.3. INVESTIGATIONS; PRE-CLOSING ACCESS.

                  (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, allow the Purchaser, through its employees and
representatives, to make such continuing investigation of the assets,
liabilities, business, operations, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as the Purchaser may reasonably request. Any investigation or
examination by the Purchaser of the Company and its Subsidiaries or access
pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be conducted or occur at reasonable times
during regular business hours, as approved in advance by the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company; the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
their respective employees and representatives, including, without limitation,
counsel, investment bankers and independent public accountants, to, cooperate
with the Purchaser's employees and its representatives in connection with such
review and examination; and any such investigation, examination or interview
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement
or, at the request of the Company, a separate confidentiality agreement between
the Company and each of such employees and representatives that is substantially
identical to the Confidentiality Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company shall also deliver to Purchaser and its advisors such tax returns,
supporting materials and related documents as Purchaser reasonably deems
necessary to diligence the principal amount of the Defeasance Cost Tax Note.

                  (b) Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Company shall
furnish to the Purchaser as soon as available and in any event not later than
the end of each fiscal month, an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as of the end of the preceding fiscal month and the related consolidated
statements of earnings and stockholders' equity (deficit) for such period, and,
as soon as available and in any event within twenty-five (25) Business Days
after the end of each fiscal quarter, a statement of cash flows for the quarter
then ended, each prepared in accordance with GAAP in conformity with the
practices consistently applied by the Company with respect to its monthly and
quarterly financial statements. All the foregoing shall be in accordance with
the books and records of the Company and shall fairly present its consolidated
financial position (taking into account the differences between the monthly and
quarterly statements prepared by the Company in conformity with its past
practices) as of the last day of the period then ended.

                  (c) The foregoing shall not require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to (i) permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that
in their reasonable judgment could reasonably be expected to result in (A) the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or the violation of any
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
confidentiality provided that they shall have used commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or
disclosure, (B) the waiver of any applicable attorney-client privilege, or (C)
the violation of any Applicable Law or (ii) provide access to any property for
purposes of testing or invasive sampling of soil groundwater, structural or
mechanical components, tanks or other conditions.

                  (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 6.3,
the Purchaser and each other party to this Agreement shall cooperate in
implementing the provisions of this Section 6.3 so as not to prevent or
interfere with the compliance with Section 6.1 hereof.

                  SECTION 6.4. HSR ACT FILINGS; CONSENTS.

                  (a) The Company, the Significant Stockholders and the
Purchaser shall, to the extent required by the HSR Act, as promptly as
practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, file, or cause to be filed, (i) Notification and Report Forms
under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "Antitrust
Division") in connection with the Subject Transactions and (ii) any similar
notices or filings required to be made under any competition law or similar
statute or regulation of any foreign jurisdiction in connection with the Subject
Transactions, and will use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any applicable foreign Government Entity for additional information
or documentation and to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act (and any
competition law or similar statute or regulation of any foreign jurisdiction) to
terminate or expire at the earliest possible date or to obtain any necessary
consents or approvals from any such Government Entity. Each of the Company and
the Purchaser shall inform the other promptly of any communication made by or on
behalf of such party to, or received from, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or
any applicable foreign Government Entity and shall furnish to the other such
information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of any filing, submission or other act that is necessary or
advisable under the HSR Act or similar foreign statute or regulation. The
parties hereto agree not to take any action or omit to take any action that will
have the effect of unreasonably delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of
any required authorizations, consents, orders or approvals.

                  (b) The Company, the Significant Stockholders and the
Purchaser shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to obtain all
consents, approvals and agreements of, and to give and make all notices and
filings with, any Government Entities necessary to authorize, approve or permit
the consummation of the Subject Transactions. The Company, the Significant
Stockholders and the Purchaser shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts
to obtain all other consents and approvals to the Subject Transactions,
including (i) the matters set forth on Schedule 3.6, Schedule 4.4 and Schedule
6.4, (ii) of any Person from whom consents and approvals are required under any
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and (iii)
the consents of any other third parties.

                  (c) Each party shall provide all necessary information,
documentation and communications to any Government Entities and other Persons
required to consummate the Subject Transactions. Each party shall cooperate with
the other in obtaining, as promptly as practicable, all approvals,
authorizations and clearances of Government Entities and other Persons required
to consummate the Subject Transactions. Each party hereto shall have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other
on, in each case subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information or other applicable confidentiality requirements, all the
information relating to the Significant Stockholders, the Company or its
Subsidiaries, the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, as the case
may be, that appears in any filings or other submissions with, or other written
materials submitted to, any third party or Government Entity in connection with
Subject Transactions. The Company, the Significant Stockholders and the
Purchaser agree, subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information or applicable confidentiality agreements, that they will keep the
other

                                       48

<PAGE>

apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the Subject
Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of any notice
or other communications received by any of the Significant Stockholders, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the Purchaser, as the case may be, from
any third party or Government Entity with respect to the Subject Transactions,
including, without limitation, all notices of claims, suits and actions for
which any such party receives service of process.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.4,
neither the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Securityholders nor the Purchaser and
its direct or indirect equity owners shall be obligated to: sell or otherwise
dispose of, or hold separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise), particular assets or categories of assets, or operations, of the
Company, its Subsidiaries, the Securityholders or the Purchaser or any of its
direct or indirect equity owners (as the case may be). The Purchaser covenants
that it will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, acquire at any
time prior to the Closing Date any interest in any Person (or any assets of any
Person) that competes in any material respect in any relevant market with any of
the businesses conducted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the date
hereof.

                  SECTION 6.5. FURTHER ASSURANCES.

                  (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein
provided, on and prior to the Closing Date, each of the Company, the Significant
Stockholders and the Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions or do, or cause to be done, all things or execute
any documents necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the Subject Transactions, including without limitation in the
case of the Significant Stockholders terminating without further liability on
the part of the Company the agreements set forth on Exhibit I hereto.

                  (b) The Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Financing and the Equity Investment described in the Financing Documents in
order to consummate the Subject Transactions (including, without limitation,
borrowing the Interim Loans (as defined in, and subject to the terms of, the
Debt Financing Documents (as defined in Section 5.7 hereof)). The Company agrees
to provide, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
officers, directors, agents, employees, financial advisors, counsel, accountants
and other representatives and Affiliates to provide, such cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by the Purchaser and approved by counsel for the Company
and the Stockholders (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, including without
limitation, participation in meetings, due diligence sessions, road shows, the
preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and
similar documents, the execution and delivery of any further commitment letters,
underwriting or placement agreements, pledge and security documents, other
definitive financing documents, or other requested certificates or documents,
including comfort letters of accountants and such other certificates or
documents as the Purchaser may reasonably request from time to time.

                  (c) In the event that at any time funds are not or have not
been made available pursuant to the Financing Documents so as to enable the
Purchaser to proceed with the Subject Transactions in a timely manner, the
Purchaser shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative
funding in an amount at least equal to the amount to be provided pursuant to the

                                       49

<PAGE>

Financing Documents on terms and conditions substantially comparable to those
provided in the Financing Documents, or otherwise on terms reasonably acceptable
to the Purchaser, and (ii) shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate the Subject Transactions.

                  (d) Following the date hereof, the Purchaser shall promptly
disclose to the Company any amendment or modification, or any termination or
cancellation of, the Financing, or any information that becomes known to the
Purchaser or its Affiliates and that makes it unlikely that the condition set
forth in Section 7.6 will be satisfied at the Closing. None of the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates will knowingly attempt, directly or indirectly, to induce
or encourage the Finance Parties or other Persons not to fund any of the
financing provided for in the Financing Documents.

                  (e) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date each party
hereto will promptly notify the others in writing of any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of such party or the occurrence
of any event or condition that is reasonably likely to result in the failure of
the conditions of any party to consummate the Closing; provided, however, that
the Lehman Stockholders shall have no such obligation with respect to any
information it might learn from or about Lehman Brothers Inc. or any of the
Affiliates of Lehman Brothers Inc. other than the Lehman Stockholders.

                  SECTION 6.6. TRANSACTION EXPENSES; DEFEASANCE COSTS.

                  (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, (i) the Company shall bear all Company Transaction Expenses, (ii) the
Purchaser shall bear all Purchaser Transaction Expenses and (iii) each
Stockholder shall bear its respective fees, costs and expenses incurred by such
Stockholder relating to the Subject Transactions (whether incurred prior to or
after the date hereof), including fees and disbursements of counsel, financial
advisors, consultants, accountants, actuaries and other advisors, but in the
case of each Significant Stockholder only to the extent that such do not
constitute Company Transaction Expenses.

                  (b) Each Significant Stockholder shall submit to the Company
and the Purchaser, not later than the close of business, New York, New York
time, three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a schedule setting
forth all fees, costs and expenses that such Significant Stockholder shall have
incurred in connection with the Subject Transactions, and only such fees, costs
and expenses as are on such schedule shall constitute Company Transaction
Expenses. Each Stockholder shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser, the
Company and its Subsidiaries for any and all such fees, costs and expenses
incurred by such Stockholder relating to the Subject Transactions (whether
incurred prior to or after the date hereof) to the extent that such do not
constitute Company Transaction Expenses.

                  (c) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide written notice to the Purchaser of the payment prior to the
Closing Date of any Company Transaction Expenses or Defeasance Costs, including
the amount thereof, promptly after the payment thereof; provided, however, that
the Company shall not be required to provide such

                                       50

<PAGE>

notice until the aggregate amount of all Company Transaction Expenses and
Defeasance Costs previously paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
without notice to the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.6(c) equals or
exceeds (or after giving effect to any such payment would exceed) Twenty Five
Thousand Dollars ($25,000). The Significant Stockholders and the Company hereby
covenant and agree that the Company shall cause all of the Company Transaction
Expenses and Defeasance Costs (other than any Tender Offer Consideration and any
Consent Payments that may become payable after the Closing) to be paid on or
prior to the Closing Date, and the Significant Stockholders shall, severally in
proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portions, indemnify the Purchaser and
the Company for any Company Transaction Expenses or Defeasance Costs (other than
any Tender Offer Consideration and any Consent Payments that may become payable
after the Closing) that remain unpaid after the Closing.

                  SECTION 6.7. EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

                  (a) The Purchaser acknowledges that the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing will continue to
be employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries immediately after the time
of the Closing and that the terms of employment for such employees will be the
same terms and conditions as are applicable prior to the Closing, except to the
extent any such employee becomes a party to an Employment Agreement on the
Closing Date. The Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
provide, for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, welfare,
retirement and fringe benefits to all Persons employed by the Company or any
Subsidiary (and any of their eligible dependents as of the Closing Date)
(collectively, the "Company Employees") substantially similar, in each case, to
the benefits provided to the Company Employees under the Benefit Plans
immediately before the Closing Date, except to the extent otherwise provided in
any Employment Agreement to which any Company Employee becomes a party on the
Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event
that the employment of any Company Employee is terminated by the Company or any
Subsidiary prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, such Company
Employee shall have the same rights to receive such benefits, including a
severance benefit (if one is payable under the circumstances), that are not less
than the rights to receive benefits that the Company Employee would have had in
connection with such Company Employee's termination of employment under the
terms of the Benefit Plans in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing. This Section 6.7(a) is intended to be for the
benefit of and to grant third party rights to the Company Employees whether or
not parties to this Agreement, and each of the Company Employees shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein.

                  (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to offer employment agreements to the
employees whose names are set forth on Schedule 6.7(b) hereof (the "Key
Employees"). The forms of such employment agreements are attached as part of
Exhibit E.

                  (c) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to offer employment agreements to Bernard
L. Schwartz and Kenneth M. Schwartz. The forms of such employment agreements are
attached hereto as part of Exhibit E.

                                       51

<PAGE>

                  (d) Subject to Section 6.7(a) and the terms of any Employment
Agreement (with respect to any Company Employee who becomes a party thereto on
the Closing Date), the Company may amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans
at any time following the Closing Date in accordance with their respective terms
and Applicable Law. In connection with any employee benefit plan (other than the
Benefit Plans) provided to the Company Employees after the Closing Date (i)
participants therein shall receive full credit for all service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, recognition of service for
eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any
pension or retirement plan), (ii) the Purchaser shall cause the Company to
waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to
pre-existing and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the employees under the Company's welfare
plans (except for limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect and
that have not been satisfied with respect to such employees under the Benefit
Plans), and (iii) participants therein shall receive credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid by such employees under the Benefit Plans for the year in
which such participation commences.

                  (e) The Company shall promptly notify the Purchaser of any
pre-Closing communications it or any of its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, attorneys or other representatives receive from the Department of
Labor or the PBGC relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement and permit the Purchaser to review in advance any
proposed filing or written communication by the Company to the Department of
Labor or the PBGC. The Purchaser will provide the Company and the PBGC with all
documents and information required to respond to any inquiry from the Department
of Labor or the PBGC.

                  SECTION 6.8. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS;
RELEASES.

                  (a) It is understood and agreed that the Company shall, to the
fullest extent permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law and
regardless of whether the Closing occurs, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the present and former officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company
and of the Company's Subsidiaries (each a "Company Indemnified Party" and
collectively the "Company Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, including without limitation,
liabilities arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions (other than
illegal acts or fraud), by them in their capacities as such, whether commenced,
asserted or claimed before or after the Closing Date; provided, however, that no
indemnification shall be made to (i) any Company Indemnified Person to the
extent it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (after all
rights to appeal shall have expired) that such Company Indemnified Party did
not, with the respect to the matter subject to indemnification hereunder, act in
good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Company (or any Subsidiary thereof) or (ii) any
Securityholder or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or
Affiliates of any Securityholder that, in any such case, is finally determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction (after all rights to appeal shall have
expired) to be in respect of any liabilities resulting from, relating to or
arising out of any Purchaser Indemnifiable Matter. If any indemnity is paid to
or for the benefit of any Company Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
6.8(a) or otherwise, and it is later determined that such Company Indemnified
Party was not entitled to any part of

                                       52

<PAGE>

such indemnification, such Company Indemnified Party shall pay to the Company on
demand such part of such indemnification together with interest thereon at a
rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate from the date such indemnification was
paid to or for the benefit of such Company Indemnified Party until such
indemnification is repaid to the Company.

                  (b) In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, (i) the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel selected by the Company Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, promptly as statements therefor are
received, and (ii) the Company will cooperate in the defense of any such matter;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); and provided, further, that the Company shall
not be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.8(b) to pay the fees and
disbursements of more than one counsel for all Company Indemnified Parties in
any single action except to the extent that, in the opinion of counsel for the
Company Indemnified Parties, two or more of such Company Indemnified Parties
have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action. For six years after
the Closing Date, the Company shall (x) maintain or obtain officers' and
directors' liability insurance, or purchase extension(s) of the discovery period
under the Company's existing policies for a total of six (6) years, covering the
Company Indemnified Parties who are currently covered by the Company's officers
and directors liability insurance policy with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date on terms not less favorable than those
in effect on the date of this Agreement in terms of scope of coverage and
amounts (provided that in either such case the Company and the Representatives
will work together to obtain such insurance at the lowest possible cost); and
(y) not amend the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company if the
effect of doing so would be to reduce or narrow the scope of the Company's
obligations to indemnify the Company Indemnified Parties or to reduce or narrow
the scope of any exculpatory provision in favor of the Company Indemnified
Parties. This Section 6.8 shall survive the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall
cause the Company to comply with this Section 6.8 and to reimburse all expenses,
including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, incurred by any Person to
enforce the obligations of the Purchaser and the Company under this Section 6.8.
This Section 6.8 is intended to be for the benefit of and to grant third party
rights to Company Indemnified Parties whether or not parties to this Agreement,
and each of the Company Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the
covenants contained herein.

                  (c) If the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Company assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no transfer or assignment shall
release any Person from that Person's obligations as set forth in this Section
6.8.

                  SECTION 6.9. STOCK OPTIONS.

                  Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall comply with the
terms of each Option, subject to the terms of this Agreement. To the extent any
Options are exercised in whole or in part prior to the Closing, the Company
shall cause the exercising holder to execute a joinder

                                       53

<PAGE>

to this Agreement, in the form of Exhibit F, to become a Stockholder hereunder
with respect to all of the shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to such
Option. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cause each Optionholder who
has not exercised such Optionholder's Options to enter into an Option
Termination Agreement. At the Closing, each Option then outstanding and
unexercised shall be cancelled and terminated in exchange for the cash payment
to the applicable holder as provided in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, and the Option
Plans shall be terminated.

                  SECTION 6.10. CUSTODY OF SHARE CERTIFICATES.

                  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, each of the
Stockholders and the Company shall enter into a custody agreement, in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit L (the "Custody Agreement"), with Ronald H. Kisner
(the "Custodian") and each of the Stockholders shall deliver to the Custodian
certificate(s) with appropriate transfer stamps, if any, affixed thereto,
representing the shares of Common Stock owned by such Stockholder with
appropriate stock powers duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by other duly
executed instruments of transfer. As soon as practicable after the date hereof,
but in any event no less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall, or shall cause each Optionholder to, deliver to the Custodian
all Option Termination Agreements and any other agreements pertaining to the
Options held by the Optionholders accompanied by other duly executed instruments
of transfer as the Custodian may reasonably require. The Custodian will hold
such certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock and Option Termination
Agreements in accordance with the terms of the Custody Agreement until the
Closing or the termination of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 6.11. NOTES TENDER OFFER.

                  (a) Promptly after the date of this Agreement and in any event
not later than five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, the Company will
commence (i) a cash tender offer (the "9 5/8% Notes Tender Offer") in respect of
all of the outstanding 9 5/8% Notes and (ii) a cash tender offer (the "9 1/4%
Notes Tender Offer" and, together with the 9 5/8 Notes Tender Offer, the "Tender
Offers") in respect of all of the outstanding 9 1/4% Notes. The aggregate
consideration payable to each holder of 9 5/8% Notes pursuant to the 9 5/8%
Notes Tender Offer and each holder of 9 1/4% Notes pursuant to the 9 1/4% Notes
Tender Offer, in respect of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
prior to the relevant expiration date of the relevant Tender Offer, shall be an
amount in cash (the "Tender Offer Consideration") to be mutually agreed upon by
the Purchaser and the Representatives within four (4) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement. Such Tender Offer Consideration may be increased from
time to time by the Company at any time from that set forth in the respective
drafts of the Offer to Purchase delivered to the Purchaser concurrent with the
execution of this Agreement. Each Tender Offer shall be made pursuant to the
relevant Offer to Purchase.

                  (b) As part of each of the Tender Offers, the Company shall
solicit the consent of the holders of the respective series of Notes to certain
amendments, including the elimination of the covenants set forth on Schedule
6.11 (the "Proposed Amendments"), to the respective indentures governing such
series of Notes as described in the respective Offers to Purchase (the "Notes
Consents"), and shall offer to pay an amount in cash (the "Consent Payment") to
be mutually agreed upon by the Purchaser and the Representatives within four (4)
Business Days

                                       54

<PAGE>

after the date of this Agreement (which amount shall not be less than the
amounts set forth in the respective drafts of the Offer to Purchase delivered to
the Purchaser concurrent with the execution of this Agreement), as such amount
may be increased by the Company from time to time, to each holder of a Note who
is entitled to vote on the Proposed Amendments and who validly consents to the
Proposed Amendments prior to the tenth (10th) day after the commencement of the
relevant Tender Offer (as such date may be extended, provided that the consent
of the Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld) is
required to extend more than five business days), the "Consent Date"). The
Company represents that the Proposed Amendments do not require the consent of
the holders of more than a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the 9
5/8% Notes or the 9 1/4% Notes, respectively, entitled to vote thereon and that,
to the Knowledge of the Company, the aggregate principal amount of the 9 5/8%
Notes and the 9 1/4% Notes not entitled to vote thereon does not exceed $800,000
and $3,184,000, respectively.

                  (c) The Company's obligation pursuant to each Tender Offer to
accept for payment and pay for any of the Notes tendered pursuant to such Tender
Offer shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) the consummation of the
Closing and (ii) such other conditions as are customary or appropriate for
transactions similar to the Tender Offers. Subject to the terms and conditions
of the Tender Offers, the Company agrees to accept for payment and to pay for
(at the times specified in the relevant Offer to Purchase) all Notes validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn. The Company will not waive any of the
conditions to either Tender Offer without the consent of the Purchaser, which
consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.

                  (d) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, (i) complete the preparation of the Offers to Purchase,
together with related letters of transmittal and similar ancillary agreements
(such documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being
referred to herein collectively as the "Tender Offer Documents"), relating to
each Tender Offer and (ii) disseminate to the record holders of the 9 5/8% Notes
and 9 1/4% Notes and, to the extent known by the Company, the beneficial owners
thereof (collectively, the "Noteholders"), the Tender Offer Documents relating
to the applicable Tender Offer; provided, however, that prior to the
dissemination thereof, the Company shall consult with the Purchaser with respect
to all of the Tender Offer Documents and shall afford the Purchaser reasonable
opportunity to comment thereon. The Tender Offer Documents will comply with all
Applicable Laws and the Company shall make all filings or obtain all consents
required under Applicable Law with respect thereto. The Purchaser shall provide
the Company with any information for inclusion in the Tender Offer Documents
which may be required under Applicable Laws and which is reasonably requested by
the Company. If at any time prior to the acceptance of the 9 5/8% Notes or 9
1/4% Notes pursuant to the Tender Offers, any event should occur that is
required by Applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement
to, any of the Tender Offer Documents, the Company will prepare and disseminate
such amendment or supplement; provided, however, that prior to such
dissemination, the Company shall consult with the Purchaser with respect to such
amendment or supplement and shall afford the Purchaser reasonable opportunity to
comment thereon. The Company will notify the Purchaser at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the mailing of any amendment or supplement to the Tender
Offer Documents to the Noteholders.

                                       55

<PAGE>

                  (e) With respect to each of the 9 5/8% Notes and 9 1/4% Notes,
at such time as the Company receives Note Consents from Noteholders holding at
least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of each such series entitled
to vote thereon, the Company agrees to execute, and to cause all of the
guarantors that are a party to the indenture governing such notes (the
"Applicable Indenture") to execute, and will use reasonable best efforts to
cause the trustee under the Applicable Indenture to execute, a supplemental
indenture (a "Supplemental Indenture") in order to give effect to the applicable
Proposed Amendments; provided, however, that notwithstanding the fact that any
Supplemental Indenture will become effective upon such execution, the Proposed
Amendments set forth therein will not become operative unless and until all
conditions to such Tender Offer have been satisfied or waived by the Company and
the Company accepts on the Closing Date the 9 5/8% Notes or 9 1/4% Notes, as
applicable, (and related Notes Consents) validly tendered and not theretofore
validly withdrawn for purchase and payment pursuant to such Tender Offer. In
such event, the parties hereto agree, and the Tender Offer Documents will
provide, that the Proposed Amendments will be deemed operative as of immediately
prior to such acceptance for payment on the Closing Date, and the Company will
thereafter be obligated to pay all Tender Offer Consideration and Consent
Payments in accordance with the terms of the relevant Offer to Purchase.

                  (f) If at any time prior to the Closing Date any information
should be discovered by any party hereto, which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any Tender Offer Documents mailed to any Noteholder
so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto
and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, the Company shall promptly
prepare an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information, and,
if required, file such amendment or supplement with the SEC or disseminate such
amendment or supplement to the applicable Noteholders.

                  (g) If the Notes Consent Condition shall not have been
satisfied by the Closing Date with respect to either or both of the 9 5/8% Notes
or the 9 1/4% Notes, then, at the Purchaser's election and provided the
Purchaser complies with subsection (h) of this Section 6.11, on the Closing Date
the Company (i) shall irrevocably deposit with the applicable trustee the amount
required to satisfy the applicable "covenant defeasance" condition of the 9 5/8%
Notes or the 9 1/4% Notes, as applicable, and (ii) shall comply with all other
conditions to a "covenant defeasance" that are capable of being satisfied by the
Closing Date (a "Note Defeasance").

                  (h) The Purchaser shall take any and all necessary action to
provide, or cause to be provided, to the Company at the Closing funds in an
amount equal to the Closing Date Indebtedness attributable to the 9 5/8% Notes
or 9 1/4% Notes, as applicable, validly tendered and not theretofore validly
withdrawn pursuant to the relevant Tender Offer, which funds shall be used by
the Company, together with other funds available to the Company, to consummate
the Tender Offers and/or any required Note Defeasance on the Closing Date,
provided that the conditions to the consummation of the Closing have been
satisfied or waived.

                                       56

<PAGE>

                  (i) Each of the Significant Stockholders hereby agree to
tender all of the Notes held by them in the Tender Offers and to cause each of
their respective Affiliates (provided that the Lehman Stockholders will not be
so obligated with respect to Lehman Brothers Inc. or any Affiliates of Lehman
Brothers Inc. other than the Lehman Stockholders) to tender all of the Notes
held by them in the Tender Offers.

                  SECTION 6.12. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES.

                  The Company shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver to the Purchaser at the Closing an estoppel certificate, executed by
each landlord under the Real Property Leases and substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit N or in the form required under the applicable Real
Property Lease. To the extent an estoppel certificate is delivered to the
Purchaser with respect to a Real Property Lease, any representations and
warranties of the Company or its Subsidiaries hereunder relating to such Real
Property Lease that are specifically set forth in the applicable estoppel
certificate shall no longer be required to be made by the Company or its
Subsidiaries hereunder with respect to the matters covered by such estoppel
certificate and such representations and warranties shall, to such extent (but
only to such extent), be deemed to be null and void and of no force or effect.
If obtained, such estoppel certificates shall not disclose any information
relating to the applicable Real Property Lease which would, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 6.13. CERTAIN TAX MATTERS.

                  (a) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the parties
hereto agree to cause state and local Tax periods of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to be closed at the close of business on the Closing Date. The
Purchaser agrees that, as of the day following the Closing Date, the Company
shall become a member of the "affiliated group" of corporations of which the
Purchaser is a member, as defined in Code Section 1504(a) (the "Purchaser Tax
Group"), and shall be included in a federal consolidated income Tax Return that
will be filed by such affiliated group for a taxable period that will include
the day following the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall timely file or cause to
be timely filed when due all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that are required to be filed after the Closing Date (including, without
limitation, a federal income Tax Return for the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the taxable period ending on the Closing Date) and the Purchaser shall pay or
cause to be paid all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns (subject in all
cases to Section 9.3). All Straddle Period Tax Returns and all Tax Returns
relating to periods ending on or before the Closing Date that are prepared by
the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.13 shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice. The Purchaser will not permit the Company and its
Subsidiaries to treat the Subject Transactions as being properly allocable to
the portion of the Closing Date occurring after the Closing or as occurring
after the Closing Date pursuant to the "Next Day Rule" under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). The Tax Returns described in the
second preceding sentence shall be submitted to the Representatives no later
than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the due date and filing thereof for
review and approval of the Representatives. The Representatives shall respond in
writing to the Purchaser with any comments within five (5) Business Days of
receiving the draft Tax Return(s). The Representatives and the Purchaser shall
consult with each other and attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising
as a result of such Tax Returns and, if they are unable to do so, the disputed
items shall be resolved (within a

                                       57

<PAGE>

reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for filing such Tax Return) by
an internationally recognized independent accounting firm chosen by and mutually
agreeable to the Purchaser and the Representatives. Upon resolution of all such
items, the relevant Tax Return shall be timely filed on that basis. All Straddle
Period Tax Returns and all Tax Returns relating to periods ending on or before
the Closing Date that are prepared by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section
6.13 shall be prepared and filed as soon as practicable (but in no event after
the due date of such Tax Return, including any extension thereof). The Purchaser
shall, upon the Representatives' written request, prepare and prosecute a claim
or suit for a refund of or reduction in Taxes for any taxable period, provided
that the Significant Stockholders shall pay all reasonable expenses in
connection with the preparation and prosecution of such claim or suit. The
Purchaser shall not file any amended Tax Return for any period of the Company
and its Subsidiaries ending on or prior to the Closing Date or for the Straddle
Period without the prior written consent of the Representatives (which consent
shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld).

                  (b) The Purchaser, the Stockholders, the Company and each of
their respective Subsidiaries shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and such parties' respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits
with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes, including maintaining and
making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes.

                  (c) For purposes of this Section 6.13, whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by
assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one
which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at the
beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain,
deduction, loss or credit, and state and local apportionment factors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between
such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming
that the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries were closed at the end of the
Closing Date. However, (A) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation and (B)
periodic taxes such real and personal property taxes shall be apportioned
ratably between such periods on a daily basis.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

        CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE OBLIGATION OF THE PURCHASER TO CLOSE

hereof and as of the Closing Date, except that any such representations and
warranties that expressly relate to a specified date shall be true and correct
only as of such date, in each case, except where the failure to be so true and
correct (without giving effect to any limitation or qualification as to
"materiality" (including the word "material") or "Material Adverse Effect" or
words of similar import set forth herein or therein) would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of the

foregoing effect (in respect of the Company's or such Stockholder's
representations and warranties), dated the Closing Date and signed by the
Company or such Stockholder.

complied with or performed prior to the Closing Date. The Company and each of
the Stockholders shall have delivered to the Purchaser a certificate to the
foregoing effect (in respect of the Company's or such Stockholder's covenants),
dated the Closing Date and signed by the Company or such Stockholder.

                  SECTION 7.3. GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY CONSENTS AND

notices required in order to consummate the Subject Transactions shall have been
made (and any applicable waiting periods shall have expired or been terminated
in accordance with Applicable Law) and all governmental approvals required shall
have been received (and no such approvals shall contain any materially
burdensome requirement on the Company or the Purchaser or its Affiliates).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the condition set forth in this Section 7.3(b)
shall be deemed satisfied with respect to Brazil upon the making by the Company
of any required filings with Brazilian Government Entities.

                  SECTION 7.4. INJUNCTION.

                  There shall not be in effect any judgment, order, injunction
or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining the consummation of
the Subject Transactions.

                                       59

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 7.5. MATERIALITY OF CONDITIONS.

                  Notwithstanding anything contained herein, no condition
involving performance of agreements by the Company or any of the Stockholders
(other than those in Article II) as of the Closing shall be deemed not
fulfilled, and the Purchaser shall not be entitled to fail to consummate the
Subject Transactions or terminate this Agreement on such basis, if the respects
in which such agreements have not been performed, in the aggregate, would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 7.6. FINANCING.

                  All of the conditions to the Finance Parties' obligations to
provide the financing described in the Financing Documents shall be satisfied or
waived by the party entitled to waive the same, other than those conditions
described in the following paragraphs of Exhibit D to the Commitment Letter
included in the Debt Financing Documents, in each case to the extent such
paragraph is applicable to the Purchaser and the other entities that are, as of
immediately prior to the Closing, Affiliates of the Purchaser: paragraph (a);
paragraph (b); paragraph (c), but only in the event that the failure to satisfy
such paragraph (c) is the result of a breach by Purchaser or any of its
foregoing Affiliates of its obligations hereunder, under the Financing Documents
or under any Ancillary Agreement; paragraph (f); paragraph (g)(ii), but only in
the event that the failure to satisfy such paragraph (g)(ii) is the result of a
breach by Purchaser or any of its foregoing Affiliates of its obligations
hereunder, under the Financing Documents or under any Ancillary Agreement;
paragraph (i), but only in the event that the failure to satisfy such paragraph
(i) is the result of a breach by Purchaser or any of its foregoing Affiliates of

Subsidiaries will have any Indebtedness outstanding upon consummation of the
Subject Transactions and all Encumbrances on the Assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries securing payment for any Indebtedness will be terminated prior

appropriate transfer stamps, if any, affixed thereto, evidencing all of the

     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS; INDEMNIFICATION

                  SECTION 9.1. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
COVENANTS.

                  All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any schedule, certificate
or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection with the
Subject Transactions shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the

to recover for any Losses pursuant to this Agreement unless written notice of a
claim therefor (describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with

party on or before the Applicable Limitation Date with respect to such claim,
irrespective of whether the subject matter of such claim shall have occurred
before or after the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Applicable Limitation Date" shall mean the date that is eighteen (18) months
after the Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) with respect to any Loss
arising from

                                       64

<PAGE>

(A) a breach of the representations and warranties of the Company, the
Stockholders or the Purchaser (as applicable) set forth in Sections 3.1(a),
3.1(c), 3.2, 3.3, 3.21, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4. 4.5, 4.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5,
5.6, 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10 (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations and
Warranties") or (B) fraud or an intentional misrepresentation or an intentional
breach or (C) a breach after the Closing Date of any covenant or agreement that
by its terms requires compliance or performance at or after the Closing Date,
the Applicable Limitation Date shall be the date of expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations with respect thereto; (ii) with respect to any Loss
arising from a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.14, the Applicable Limitation Date shall be thirty (30) days after the date of
expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment and collection of
the applicable Tax; and (iii) with respect to the indemnification obligations of
the Significant Stockholders under Section 9.2(a)(iii), the Applicable
Limitation Date shall be the date that is six years and six months after the
Closing Date.

                  Neither the Stockholders nor the Purchaser shall have any
liability whatsoever with respect to any such representations and warranties
unless a claim is made hereunder prior to the Applicable Limitation Date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall survive as to such claim until
such claim has been finally resolved.

                  SECTION 9.2. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SIGNIFICANT STOCKHOLDERS
AND THE STOCKHOLDERS.

                  (a) If the Closing occurs, then subject to Section 9.1 the
Significant Stockholders shall save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) and
their respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents and the
successors and assigns of each of the foregoing (collectively, the "Purchaser
Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities,
claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
investigating, prosecuting, preparing for the prosecution or defense of or
defending the foregoing) (hereinafter collectively, "Losses"), asserted against,
incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the foregoing as a result of or
arising out of:

                           (i) any pre-Closing breach of any representation or
         warranty made by the Company contained in this Agreement or any
         Ancillary Agreement or any schedule, certificate or other document
         delivered by the Company on the Closing Date pursuant hereto or
         thereto;

                           (ii) any pre-Closing breach of any covenant or
         agreement by the Company contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary
         Agreement or any schedule, certificate or other document delivered by
         the Company on the Closing Date pursuant hereto or thereto (including
         as a result of the action or failure to act of the Company or any of
         its Subsidiaries); and

                           (iii) any matter set forth on Schedule 9.2(a)(iii) to
         this Agreement.

                                       65

<PAGE>

                  (b) If the Closing occurs, then subject to Section 9.1, each
of the Stockholders shall, severally and not jointly, save, defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any and all
Losses asserted against, incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the foregoing
as a result of or arising out of:

                           (i) any representation or warranty made by such
         Stockholder contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or
         any schedule, certificate or other document delivered by such
         Stockholder on the Closing Date pursuant hereto or thereto; and

                           (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement by such
         Stockholder contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or
         any schedule, certificate or other document delivered by such
         Stockholder on the Closing Date pursuant hereto or thereto.

                  (c) In the case of any claim for indemnity pursuant to Section
9.2(a), the obligations of the Significant Stockholders shall be several and not
joint, which shall mean that a Significant Stockholder shall be liable only to
the extent of such Significant Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of such Loss. The
Purchaser Indemnified Parties' remedy for any indemnification of Losses under
Section 9.2(b) above may be satisfied by proceeding only against the Stockholder
committing such breach and, in the case of any Significant Stockholder, the
Sub-Account (as defined in the Indemnity Escrow Agreement) of such Significant
Stockholder in accordance with the terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.3. LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SIGNIFICANT
STOCKHOLDERS AND THE STOCKHOLDERS.

                  The indemnification provided for in Section 9.2 above is
subject to the following covenants and limitations:

                  (a) The aggregate amount of all payments made by any
Significant Stockholder in satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant
to Section 9.2(a) shall not exceed such Significant Stockholder's Pro Rata
Portion of the Significant Stockholders' Cap; provided, however, that the
Significant Stockholders' Cap shall not apply with respect to any Losses
resulting from or arising out of breaches of any Fundamental Representations and
Warranties and such Losses shall not be limited by or count towards satisfaction
of the Significant Stockholders' Cap; and provided, further, that the aggregate
amount of all payments made by any Significant Stockholder or Stockholder in
satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.2(a) and
9.2(b) (including with respect to any Losses resulting from breaches of any
Fundamental Representations and Warranties) shall not exceed such Significant
Stockholder's or Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of the sum of the Cash Purchase
Price and the Defeasance Costs Tax Note paid to it pursuant to Section 2.2 or
2.3.

                  (b) The Significant Stockholders shall not be liable to
indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.2(a) unless
and until the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have collectively suffered aggregate
Losses otherwise indemnifiable pursuant to such Section 9.2(a) in excess of a
Five Million Dollar ($5,000,000) aggregate

                                       66

<PAGE>

deductible (the "Deductible") (at which point, subject to the other limitations
herein, the Significant Stockholders will be liable to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for their respective Pro Rata Portions of all Losses in excess of the
Deductible); provided, however, that the Deductible shall not apply with respect
to (i) any Losses resulting from or arising out of breaches of any Fundamental
Representations and Warranties; (ii) the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.14; and (iii) the indemnification obligation of the
Significant Stockholders under Section 9.2(a)(iii); and provided, further, that
where the aggregate amount of Losses (other than Losses related to Section
9.2(a)(iii)) arising out of a claim or series of related claims of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement does not exceed Ten Thousand
Dollars ($10,000), such claim or series of related claims shall not count as
Losses for purposes of Section 9.2(a) hereof.

                  (c) Any payment made by a Significant Stockholder or a
Stockholder to a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2 in respect
of any indemnifiable event shall be net of any insurance or other proceeds
recovered by such Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of such claim. In the
event that an insurance or other recovery is received by a Purchaser Indemnified
Party with respect to any Loss for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party has
previously been indemnified hereunder, then the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall promptly make a refund to the relevant Significant Stockholder (or the
Indemnity Escrow Agent) or the relevant Stockholder, as applicable, in an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of such insurance recovery (net of
collection expenses), and (ii) the amount previously paid by the Significant
Stockholder or Stockholder as indemnification for such Loss.

                  (d) If the indemnification obligation under Section 9.2 arises
in respect of any indemnifiable event (i) for which a Purchaser Indemnified
Party receives indemnification from the Significant Stockholders or the
Stockholders, as applicable, and (ii) which results in any Tax benefit to such
Purchaser Indemnified Party for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning and ending after the Closing Date which would not, but for such
indemnifiable event, be available, such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall pay,
or shall cause to be paid, to the relevant Significant Stockholders or
Stockholders (or the Indemnity Escrow Agent) an amount equal to the actual Tax
savings produced by such Tax benefit reduced by the amount of any Tax detriment
to such Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result of the receipt of such
indemnification. Tax benefits and detriments shall be taken into account as and
when actually realized. The amount of any such Tax saving for any taxable period
shall be the amount of the reduction in Taxes payable to a Tax authority by such
Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to such Tax period (net of any Tax
detriment resulting from the receipt of the indemnity payment) as compared to
the Taxes that would have been payable to a Tax authority by such Purchaser
Indemnified Party with respect to such Tax period in the absence of such Tax
benefit.

                  (e) The Significant Stockholders shall not be obligated to
indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss to the extent
that a specific accrual or reserve for the amount of such Loss was reflected or
reserved against in the Financial Statements included in the Company Report most
recently filed by the Company with SEC before the date hereof.

                  SECTION 9.4. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PURCHASER INDEMNITORS.

                  If the Closing occurs, the Purchaser and the Company
(including its Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnitors") shall
save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Securityholders and their
respective Affiliates and their respective, officers, directors, employees,
attorneys and agents and the successors and assigns of each of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Securityholder Parties") from and against any and all Losses
asserted against, incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the foregoing as a
result of or arising out of:

                  (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any
schedule, certificate or other document delivered by the Purchaser on the
Closing Date pursuant hereto;

                  (b) any breach (including as a result of the action or failure
to act of the Purchaser) of any covenant or agreement by the Purchaser contained
in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any schedule, certificate or
other document delivered by the Purchaser on the Closing Date pursuant hereto;
and

                  (c) the conduct of business by the Purchaser, the Company and
its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, including without limitation, any claim
for death, injury or property damage arising from the sale of products
manufactured by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date or
attributable to any warranties, representations or commitments with respect to
products manufactured by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date and claims under Environmental Laws and for Taxes, in each case
arising out of the conduct of business by the Purchaser, the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date.

                  SECTION 9.5. LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PURCHASER
INDEMNITORS.

                  The indemnification provided for in Section 9.4 above is
subject to the following limitations:

                  (a) The aggregate amount of all payments made by the Purchaser
Indemnitors in satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to Section
9.4 shall not exceed Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) (the "Purchaser's
Cap"); provided, however, that the Purchaser's Cap shall not apply with respect
to any Losses (i) related to any indemnification claim brought under Section
9.4(c), (ii) payments due under this Agreement including payments due under
Section 2.3 and Section 6.13 or (iii) resulting from or arising out of breaches
of any Fundamental Representations and Warranties and such Losses shall not be
limited by or count towards satisfaction of the Purchaser's Cap; and provided,
further, that the aggregate amount of all payments made by the Purchaser
Indemnitors in satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to Sections
9.4 (including with respect to Section 9.4(c) and/or any Losses resulting from
breaches of any Fundamental Representations and Warranties) shall not exceed the
sum of the Cash Purchase Price and the amount of the Defeasance Costs Tax Note.

                  (b) Except for any indemnification claim brought under Section
9.4(c), the Purchaser Indemnitors shall not be liable to indemnify any
Securityholder Party pursuant to Section 9.4 where the aggregate amount of
Losses arising out of a claim or series of related

                                       68

<PAGE>

claims of a breach of a representation or warranty does not exceed Ten Thousand
Dollars ($10,000), and no such claim or series of related claims shall not count
as Losses for purposes of Section 9.4 hereof.

                  (c) Any payment made by the Purchaser Indemnitors to a
Securityholder Party pursuant to Section 9.4 in respect of any indemnifiable
event shall be net of any insurance proceeds recovered by such Securityholder
Party in respect of such claim. In the event that an insurance recovery is
received by a Securityholder Party with respect to any Loss for which such
Securityholder Party has previously been indemnified hereunder, then such
Securityholder Party shall promptly make a refund to the Purchaser Indemnitors
in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of such insurance
recovery (net of collection expenses), and (ii) the amount previously paid by
the Purchaser Indemnitors to such Securityholder Party as indemnification for
such Loss.

                  (d) If the Purchaser Indemnitors' indemnification obligation
under Section 9.4 arises in respect of any indemnifiable event (i) for which a
Securityholder Party receives indemnification from the Purchaser Indemnitors and
(ii) which results in any Tax benefit to such Securityholder Party for any
taxable period which would not, but for such indemnifiable event, be available,
such Securityholder Party shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to the Purchaser
Indemnitors an amount equal to the actual Tax savings produced by such Tax
benefit reduced by the amount of any Tax detriment to such Securityholder Party
as a result of the receipt of such indemnification. Tax benefits and detriments
shall be taken into account as and when actually realized. The amount of any
such Tax saving for any taxable period shall be the amount of the reduction in
Taxes payable to a Tax authority by such Securityholder Party with respect to
such Tax period (net of any Tax detriment resulting from the receipt of the
indemnity payment) as compared to the Taxes that would have been payable to a
Tax authority by such Securityholder Party with respect to such Tax period in
the absence of such Tax benefit.

                  SECTION 9.6. PROCEDURES.

                  (a) In order for a Securityholder Party or Purchaser
Indemnified Party (an "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a
Loss or a claim or demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a
"Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof to the
party against whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") with
reasonable promptness after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice
of the Third Party Claim and shall provide the Indemnifying party with such
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure
and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX.

                  (b) If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party against the entirety of any Losses
(subject to any rights to recovery or offset pursuant to Sections 9.3, 9.5 or
9.10) that may result from a Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon

                                       69

<PAGE>

written notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) Business Days of
receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third
Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party (which expenses shall not be applied against any indemnity limitation
herein) with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not
expressly elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within the time
period and otherwise in accordance with the first sentence of this Section
9.6(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to assume the defense of
and to settle such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnified
Party (i) shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably apprised of material
developments in any matter for which indemnification may be sought, (ii) shall
give notice to the Indemnifying Party of pending settlement discussions and
afford the Indemnifying Party a commercially reasonable opportunity to comment
on any such pending settlement (provided that the Indemnified Party will not be
required to obtain the consent of the Indemnifying Party to any such settlement)
and (iii) shall allow the Indemnifying Party to monitor such action at its
discretion and at its sole expense. The Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with
the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnifying Party's possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of
such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the
Indemnifying Party or (ii) the named parties to the Third Party Claim (including
any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party, and the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that representation by
counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying Party and such
Indemnified Party may present such counsel with a conflict of interest. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party
all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified
Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as
is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, or
offer to settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
delayed or withheld); provided, however, that the Indemnified Party's consent
shall not be required for any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its terms
requires that the Indemnifying Party pay the full amount of the liability in
connection therewith, that otherwise releases the Indemnified Party completely
and with prejudice in connection with such Third Party Claim and that would not
subject the Indemnified Party to any injunctive or other equitable relief (it
being understood that the Indemnified Party shall have the sole discretion to
determine whether to consent to any settlement, compromise or discharge that
would subject the Indemnified Party to any injunctive or other equitable
relief).

                  (c) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to require
that any action be asserted or brought against any other Person before action is
brought or claim is made against it hereunder by the Indemnified Party, and the
Significant Stockholders shall have no right to, and

                                       70

<PAGE>

shall not, object to or protest the handling by a Purchaser Indemnified Party of
any such claim or deny or dispute any claim for indemnification brought by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties under this Article IX on the basis of the
assertion, prosecution or handling by a Purchaser Indemnified Party of any claim
by Purchaser Indemnified Party against any such other Person. The Purchaser
will, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties to, and the Significant Stockholders will, reasonably
cooperate, communicate and consult with each other with respect to any actions
or claims brought against any other such third Person.

                  (d) In any action where the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or
the Securityholder Parties reasonably determine that there are claims or
defenses available to such parties that are different from or in addition to
those available to the party defending such action, such parties shall have the
right to select separate legal counsel, at their sole cost and expense, to
assert such claims or defenses or to otherwise participate in such action.

                  (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.4, each
Indemnifying Party hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court
in which an action in respect of a Third Party Claim is brought against any
Indemnified Party for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Party may have
under this Agreement with respect to such action or the matters alleged therein
and agrees that process may be served on each Indemnifying Party with respect to
such claim in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in Section 11.3
hereof.

                  SECTION 9.7. REMEDIES NOT AFFECTED BY INVESTIGATION,
DISCLOSURE OR KNOWLEDGE.

                  No investigation conducted by or on behalf of any party at any
time and no disclosure provided to or knowledge of any party with respect to any
event, condition or circumstance that renders inaccurate any representation or
warranty or reveals the occurrence of a breach of any covenant or agreement of
any other party contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any
schedule, certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or
in connection with the Subject Transactions shall be deemed to be a waiver of
any rights to indemnification or other remedy arising in connection therewith.

                  SECTION 9.8. INDEMNITY ESCROW FUND.

                  (a) Any indemnification to be provided by the Significant
Stockholders to a Purchaser Indemnified Party under Section 9.2(a) shall be by
recourse first to, and payable from the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to the
terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, and then, subject to the limitations on
aggregate liability for such claim, by cash payment from the Significant
Stockholders; provided, however, that if the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are
seeking indemnification based upon a breach of the Fundamental Representations
and Warranties set forth in Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(c), 3.2, 3.3 or 3.21, the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have the right to elect to proceed
simultaneously against the Indemnity Escrow Fund and any one or more Significant
Stockholders directly, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.

                                       71

<PAGE>

                  (b) Any indemnification to be provided by a Stockholder to a
Purchaser Indemnified Party under Section 9.2(b) shall be by recourse directly
against such Stockholder; provided, however, that (i) in the case of any claim
against a Significant Stockholder under Section 9.2(b), the Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assert a claim against such Significant
Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to the
terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, but no monies shall be paid in respect
of such claim by the Indemnity Escrow Agent other than out of funds that would
otherwise be released to such Significant Stockholder in accordance with the
terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.9. EXCLUSIVE REMEDY; ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS.

                  (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement, no party hereto nor any of its Affiliates nor any of
their respective directors, officers, stockholders, partners (limited or
general), employees, attorneys or agents, shall have any liability whatsoever,
whether in tort or otherwise, in respect of this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement or any schedule, certificate or other document delivered by any of
them pursuant hereto or the Subject Transactions.

                  (b) No party hereto shall have any liability under any
provision of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or otherwise for any
punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, including
business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or income, or loss of
business reputation or opportunity, including, without limitation, any such
damages relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or any schedule, certificate or other document delivered
pursuant hereto or in connection with the Subject Transactions.

                  SECTION 9.10. SUBROGATION.

                  (a) If a Purchaser Indemnified Party collects an
indemnification payment from the Indemnity Escrow Fund with respect to a Loss
for which a commercially reasonable claim against a Person other than the
parties hereto is available, then the Significant Stockholders shall be
subrogated to the claims and rights of action of such Purchaser Indemnified
Party against such other Person to the extent of such indemnification payments
hereunder.

                  (b) In connection with the rights of the Significant
Stockholders pursuant to this Section 9.10, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with the Significant
Stockholders in securing the subrogation rights of the Significant Stockholders
set forth in this Section 9.10 and in pursuing claims for recovery.

                  (c) None of the Purchaser nor any Purchaser Indemnified Party
makes any representation or warranty hereunder to the Significant Stockholders
regarding the availability or enforceability of the subrogation rights set forth
in this Section 9.10. The Significant Stockholders acknowledge that third
parties may have valid defenses to any such attempted subrogation.

                  SECTION 9.11. APPOINTMENT OF THE REPRESENTATIVES.

                  (a) In order to efficiently administer the terms of Section
2.3 and the defense and/or settlement of any claims for indemnity by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2(a) ("Common Indemnification Claims"),
Bernard L. Schwartz and Alan H. Washkowitz (the "Representatives"), are hereby
appointed to serve as the representatives of the Securityholders. The
Representatives shall have full power and authority to make, on behalf of all of
the Securityholders, any and all decisions relating to the terms of Section 2.3
hereof and the defense and/or settlement of any Common Indemnification Claims
for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party may claim to be entitled to indemnity
pursuant to Section 9.2(a) hereof. All such decisions and actions by the
Representatives shall be binding upon all of the Securityholders, and no
Securityholder shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or
otherwise contest the same. All fees, costs and expenses of the Representatives
incurred by them in connection with its responsibilities as herein defined shall
be reimbursed by the Securityholders in accordance with their respective
portions of the Cash Purchase Price payable to them in accordance with Sections
2.2 and 2.3.

                  (b) Each Securityholder agrees that (i) the provision of this
Section 9.11 are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an
interest and shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies any
Securityholder or the Purchaser may have in connection with the Subject
Transactions, (ii) the remedy at law for any breach of the provisions of this
Section 9.11 would be inadequate, (iii) any Securityholder or the Purchaser
shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the
necessity of proving damages if such Securityholder or the Purchaser brings an
action to enforce the provisions of this Section 9.11, and (iv) the provisions
of this Section 9.11 shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs and
estates of each Securityholder.

                  (c) Each Securityholder hereby (i) waives any claims such
Securityholder may have or assert, including those that may arise in the future,
against the Representatives, and any of their respective Affiliates, for any
action or inaction taken or not taken by the Representatives in connection
therewith, provided that such action or inaction is not taken in a manner that
results in any Significant Stockholder paying a greater proportion of any claim
for indemnity pursuant to Section 9.2(a) hereof than such Significant
Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion thereof, and (ii) acknowledges and agrees that
neither it nor any of its successors, assigns, heirs or estates nor any of their
respective officers, directors, employees or Affiliates will have any claims or
rights to contribution or indemnity from the Purchaser, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to any amounts paid by any of them pursuant to
this Article IX.

                  (d) Any notice or communication delivered by the Purchaser or
the Company to the Representatives with respect to the administration of the
terms of Section 2.3 or the defense and/or settlement of any claims for
indemnity by a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall, as
between the Purchaser and the Company, on the one hand, and the Securityholders,
on the other, be deemed to have been delivered to all Securityholders. The
Purchaser and the Company shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon any
communication or writings given or executed by the Representatives in connection
with any claims for indemnity (other than those claims arising under Section
9.2(b)) and shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever for any action taken or
not taken in reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or

                                       73

<PAGE>

communications or writings given or executed by the Representatives. The
Purchaser and the Company shall be entitled to disregard any notices or
communications given or made by any Securityholder Party in connection with any
claims for indemnity arising under Section 9.2(a) unless given or made through
the Representatives.

injunction or decree of any court or Government Entity binding on the Purchaser,
the Company or any Stockholder, which prohibits or restrains the Purchaser, the
Company or any of the Stockholders from consummating the Subject Transactions;
provided, however, that the Purchaser, the Company and the Significant
Stockholders, as the case may be, shall have used their reasonable best efforts
to have any such order, writ, injunction or decree lifted;

                  (b) at any time prior to the Closing, by the Purchaser or any
of the Significant Stockholders in writing, if the Closing has not occurred on

the case of the Significant Stockholders, the Company) is in material violation
or breach of its agreements, representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement;

                  (c) at any time prior to the Closing, by any of the
Significant Stockholders in writing, if there has been a material violation or
breach by the Purchaser of its agreements, covenants, representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement, which violation or breach would result
in the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1
or Section 8.2 (subject to Section 8.6) and such violation or breach shall be
incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been
cured within 30 days after written notice thereof shall have been given to the
Purchaser in accordance with Section 11.3, and if the Company and the
Stockholders are not then in material violation or breach of their agreements,
covenants, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement;

                  (d) at any time prior to the Closing, by the Purchaser in
writing, if there has been a material violation or breach by the Company or any

or warranties contained in this Agreement, which violation or breach would
result in the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 (subject to Section 7.5) and such violation or breach
shall be incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured within 30 days after written notice thereof shall have been given to
the Company and the Significant Stockholders in accordance with Section 11.3,
and if the Purchaser is not then in material

                                       74

violation or breach of its agreements, covenants, representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement;

                  (e) at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, by mutual
written consent of the Significant Stockholders and the Purchaser; or

                  (f) on the Closing Date, (i) by the Purchaser in writing, if
any of the conditions set forth in Article VII shall not have been satisfied on
or before such date or (ii) by any of the Significant Stockholders in writing,
if any of the conditions set forth in Article VIII shall not have been satisfied
on or before such date; provided, however, that no such party hereto may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(f) if such party (or, in
the case of the Significant Stockholders, the Company) is in material violation
or breach of its agreements, representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement.

                  SECTION 10.2. SURVIVAL.

                  If this Agreement is terminated and the Subject Transactions
are not consummated as described above, this Agreement shall become null and
void and of no further force and effect, and there shall be no liability or
obligation hereunder on the part of the Stockholders, the Company or the
Purchaser, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, agents, representatives, successors or assigns except (i) for the

the Stockholders and the Company, on the one hand, for all Losses, in an
aggregate amount not to exceed Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000), resulting
from or arising out of a breach by such parties of any representation, warranty
or covenant contained in this Agreement, and (iv) for liability of the
Purchaser, on the other hand, for all Losses, in an aggregate amount not to
exceed Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000), resulting from or arising out of a

ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF. Each of the parties hereto, including,

State of New York, County of New York or the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York and, by execution and delivery of this

document, liability, default, breach, violation, limitation, impediment or other
matter, although the provision for such disclosure may require such disclosure
only if such contract, document, liability, default, breach, violation,
limitation, impediment or other matter be "material," shall not be construed
against any Stockholder as an assertion by such Stockholder that any such
contract, document, liability, default, breach, violation, limitation,
impediment or other matter is, in fact, material.

                  SECTION 11.6. WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS; NON-CONTRACTUAL
REMEDIES; PRESERVATION OF REMEDIES.

                  This Agreement may be amended, superseded, canceled, renewed
or extended, and the terms hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument
signed by the Purchaser and the Representative or, in the case of a waiver, by
the party waiving compliance. Except as provided in Article IX hereof, no delay
on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, or shall any waiver on the part of any party
of any right, power or privilege, or any single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other such right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or
in equity.

                  SECTION 11.7. BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT.

                  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors, permitted assigns and
legal representatives. Neither this Agreement, nor any right hereunder, may be
assigned by any party (in whole or in part) without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto; provided, however, that the rights and obligations of
the Purchaser hereunder shall be assignable without any other party's consent to
(i) any lender of the Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Purchaser, or (iii) any third party that
acquires substantially all of the capital stock or assets of the Purchaser or
the Company, whether through a merger, consolidation, purchase of stock, asset
purchase or otherwise.

                  SECTION 11.8. INTERPRETATION.

                  (a) The parties acknowledge and agree that, except as
specifically provided herein, they may pursue judicial remedies at law or equity
in the event of a dispute with respect to the interpretation or construction of
this Agreement.

                  (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the words "hereof,"
"herein," "hereby" and other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as
a whole unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the singular is used herein, the
same shall include the plural, and whenever the plural is used herein, the same
shall include the singular, where appropriate. All terms defined herein in the
singular shall have the same meaning when used in the plural; all terms defined
herein in the plural shall have the same meaning when used in the singular.

                  SECTION 11.9. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.

                  Except as set forth in Section 6.7, Section 6.8 and except for
those parties included in the definitions of "Purchaser Indemnified Parties" and
"Securityholder Parties" in Article IX hereof, nothing in this Agreement is
intended or shall be construed to give any Person, other than the parties
hereto, their successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained
herein.

agents or representatives shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever
to the Purchaser or its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, controlling
persons, agents or representatives on any basis (including, without limitation,
in contract or tort, under federal or state securities laws or otherwise) based
upon any information provided or made available, or statements made, to the
Purchaser or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling
persons, agents or representatives (or any omissions therefrom), including,
without limitation, in respect of the specific representations and warranties of
the Stockholders or the Company set forth in this Agreement or in any Ancillary
