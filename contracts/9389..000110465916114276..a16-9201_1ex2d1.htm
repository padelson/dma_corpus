amount of any such adjustment to the Base Purchase Price, the " _Net
Debt/Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ "). If required by applicable Law, the

1.6 _Net Debt/Working Capital Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Section 1.6(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth, for

Working Capital as of December 31, 2015 (the " _Sample Closing Statement_ "),
prepared and calculated using the line items and in accordance with the
policies, procedures, principles and methods set forth on _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Closing Statement Methodologies_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to Purchaser a closing statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth a good faith estimate of the Net
Debt/Working Capital Adjustment Amount as of the Closing Date (such estimate,
the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_ ") and the calculation of such Estimated
Adjustment Amount, including an estimate of the Net Debt and the Purchased
Working Capital (estimated as of the Closing Date). The Closing Statement
shall be in the format set forth in the Sample Closing Statement and prepared
and calculated in accordance with the Closing Statement Methodologies, in each
case unless otherwise agreed by Seller and Purchaser. Until two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser may propose, and Seller will
consider in good faith but is under no obligation to agree to, revisions to
such calculation of the Estimated Adjustment Amount. Unless Seller agrees to
any such changes, the Closing Statement delivered by Seller shall be used for
purposes of calculating the Estimated Adjustment Amount.

 



 

(c) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date (or if only the First
Closing shall have occurred but either or both the France Closing or the Dutch
Closing shall not have occurred, within ninety (90) days after the last to
occur of the France Closing or the Dutch Closing, as applicable), Purchaser
shall cause to be prepared and deliver to Seller a post **-** closing
statement (the " _Post **-** Closing Statement_"), setting forth the actual
Net Debt/Working Capital Adjustment Amount, calculated as of the Closing Date,
and the calculation of the Net Debt/Working Capital Adjustment Amount,
including the Net Debt and the Purchased Working Capital (in each case,
calculated as of the Closing Date). The Post-Closing Statement shall be in the
format set forth in the Sample Closing Statement and prepared and calculated
in accordance with the Closing Statement Methodologies, in each case unless
otherwise agreed by Seller and Purchaser.

 



 

(d) Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees (i) to reasonably assist the other in
the preparation and/or review of the Closing Statement and the Post-Closing
Statement and the related determination of the Estimated Adjustment Amount,
the actual Net Debt/Working Capital Adjustment Amount and the Purchase Price;
(ii) that Seller shall, after the delivery to Purchaser of the Closing
Statement, and Purchaser shall, after the delivery to Seller of the Post-
Closing Statement until the earlier of (x) the date Seller delivers an
Objections Statement or (y) forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Post-
Closing Statement to Seller, provide the other and its Representatives, upon
the reasonable request of Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, with reasonable
access during normal business hours to its books, records (including work
papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities
and management for purposes of the review of the Closing Statement or the
Post-Closing Statement, as applicable, and the related determinations of the
Estimated Adjustment Amount, the actual Net Debt/Working Capital Adjustment
Amount and the Purchase Price, and (iii) to reasonably cooperate with the
other in connection with such reviews and determinations.

 



 

(e) If Seller has any objections to any amounts reflected in the Post-Closing
Statement, Seller will deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth its
objections thereto (an " _Objections Statement_ "), which statement will
identify in reasonable detail those items and amounts to which Seller objects
and set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such objection (the "
_Disputed Items_ "), and Purchaser and Seller will attempt to resolve and
finally determine and agree upon the Disputed Items as promptly as
practicable. If an Objections Statement is not

 



       
 

 



 

delivered to Purchaser within forty-five (45) days after receipt by Seller of
the Post-Closing Statement, the Post-Closing Statement as prepared by
Purchaser will be final, binding and non-appealable by the Parties. Seller and
Purchaser will negotiate in good faith to resolve the Disputed Items, but if
they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the
delivery of the Objections Statement to Purchaser (as such thirty (30)-day
period may be extended to the extent agreed by Seller and Purchaser in
writing), Seller and Purchaser will submit any unresolved Disputed Items to
Deloitte LLP (the " _Arbiter_ "). The proposed representative of the Arbiter
shall be reasonably acceptable to Seller and Purchaser. In the event Seller
and Purchaser submit any unresolved Disputed Items to the Arbiter, each of
them will submit a Post-Closing Statement together with such supporting
documentation as it deems appropriate, to the Arbiter within ten (10) days
after the date on which the Arbiter executes an engagement letter for purposes
of resolving the Disputed Items. Seller and Purchaser will use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Arbiter to resolve
such dispute as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days
after the date on which the Arbiter receives the Post-Closing Statements
prepared by Seller and Purchaser, or as soon thereafter as practicable. Seller
and Purchaser shall instruct the Arbiter to make a written determination of
each Disputed Item within thirty (30) days after being appointed or as soon
thereafter as practicable. In resolving any Disputed Item, the Arbiter shall
be instructed not to assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either Seller or Purchaser or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Seller or Purchaser. Seller and
Purchaser will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Arbiter to notify them in writing of its resolution of such dispute as
soon as practicable. The determination of the Arbiter with respect to each
Disputed Item will, in the absence of manifest error, be final, binding and
non-appealable by the Parties and shall be a final arbitral award that may be
entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Each Party will bear
its own costs and expenses in connection with the resolution of such dispute
by the Arbiter. The fees, costs and expenses of the Arbiter will be paid by
the Party whose positions generally did not prevail in the ArbiterÂ’s
resolution of the dispute, or if the Arbiter determines that no Party could be
fairly found to be the prevailing Party, then such fees, costs and expenses
will be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by
Purchaser.

 



 

(f) (i) If the Closing Purchase Price, solely for this purpose calculated by
applying the Net Debt/Working Capital Adjustment Amount (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_ or _Section 1.6(e)_) in lieu of the Estimated
Adjustment Amount, is less than the Closing Purchase Price actually paid
pursuant to _Section 1.12(a)(i)_, then the Base Purchase Price will be
adjusted downward by the amount of such shortfall, and Seller shall pay or
cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such shortfall to Purchaser by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Purchaser to Seller. Any such payment is to be made
within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Net Debt/Working
Capital Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant to this _Section
1.6_.

 



 

(ii) If the Closing Purchase Price, solely for this purpose calculated by
applying the Net Debt/Working Capital Adjustment Amount (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_ or _Section 1.6(e)_) in lieu of the Estimated
Adjustment Amount, is greater than the Closing Purchase Price actually paid
pursuant to _Section 1.12(a)(i)_, then the Base Purchase Price will be
adjusted upward by the amount of such excess, and Purchaser shall pay or cause
to be paid an amount in cash equal to such excess to Seller

 



      
 

 



 

by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser. Any such payment is to be made
within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Net Debt/Working
Capital Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant to this _Section
1.6_.

 



 

1.7 _Manner of Transfer_. The Parties acknowledge that, in order to facilitate
the transfer of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser, the Seller Entities, the
Rexam Entities and their respective Affiliates may transfer some or
substantially all of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities to one (1)
or more of the Purchased Entities. In such case, each Purchased Asset or
Assumed Liability so transferred to a Purchased Entity shall not be
transferred to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 1.1_ or _Section 1.3_,
respectively, but instead shall be transferred to Purchaser by virtue of the
transfer of the Purchased Equity. If any such transfer is not in accordance
with the Restructuring Steps Plan, or if Purchaser does not consent in writing
to such transfer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), then Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Purchased Entities after Closing) harmless from any Loss or
incremental Taxes suffered or incurred by any of them as a result of or
arising out of or relating to any such action taken by the Seller Entities,
the Rexam Entities or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

1.8 _Foreign Acquisition Agreement_. The transfer of each Purchased Entity
organized in a jurisdiction in which local Laws require observance of
specified formalities or procedures to legally effect a transfer of such
entity, asset or liability will be effected pursuant to short-form acquisition
agreements (the " _Foreign Acquisition Agreements_ ") on a country-by-country
basis. Each Foreign Acquisition Agreement shall be in substantially the form
attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto, except for: (i) the deletion of provisions
which are inapplicable to such Purchased Entity; (ii) such changes as may be
necessary to satisfy the requirements of applicable local Law; and (iii) such
changes as may be reasonably agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser, including
regarding employees and employee benefit matters in order to adapt such
agreement to the particular circumstances of the relevant Purchased Entity and
country; _provided_ , in each case that the Foreign Acquisition Agreements
shall serve purely to effect and make enforceable vis-a-vis third parties the
transfer of the legal and beneficial title to the applicable Purchased Equity
and shall not have any significant effect on the value being received by
Purchaser or given by Seller, including the allocation of assets and
Liabilities as between them, all of which shall be determined by this
Agreement.

 



 

1.9 _Works Council/Consultation Matters_.

 



 

(a) Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that, (i) under French labor Laws, one or
more worksÂ’ councils of Ball Packaging Europe France S.A.S. and Ball Trading
France S.A.S. (the " _French Entities_ ") will need to be informed and
consulted with respect to the Restructuring and the offer made by Purchaser to
acquire the entire share capital and voting rights of Divest Trading France
S.A.S., Divest Manufacturing France S.A.S. and Ball Trading Spain S.L.
(collectively, the " _French and Spanish Entities_ " and such share capital
voting rights, collectively, the " _French and Spanish Shares_ ") and (ii)
under Dutch labor Laws, the worksÂ’ council of Ball Packaging Europe Oss B.V.
and Ball Trading Netherlands B.V. (the " _Dutch Entities_ ") will need to be
informed and consulted with respect to the Restructuring and the offer made by
Purchaser to acquire the entire share capital and voting rights of the Dutch
Entities (collectively, the " _Dutch_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Shares_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and
without prejudice to clause (z) of the proviso to _Section 1.11(b)_, (1)
unless and until Seller has executed and delivered to Purchaser the France
Acceptance Notice, the French and Spanish Entities will not be considered
Purchased Entities and the French Seller Entities will not be considered
Seller Entities for the purpose of this Agreement, and, if no such France
Acceptance Notice is delivered prior to First Closing, the Closing Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the France Purchase Price, and (2) unless and until
Seller has executed and delivered to Purchaser the Dutch Acceptance Notice,
the Dutch Entities will not be considered Purchased Entities and (with respect
to the Dutch Entities only) the Dutch Seller Entity will not be considered a
Seller Entity for the purpose of this Agreement, and, if no such Dutch
Acceptance Notice is delivered prior to First Closing, the Closing Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Dutch Purchase Price.

 



 

(b) On the terms and conditions set forth in the offer letter attached as
_Exhibit G_ hereto (the " _French Offer Letter_ " and the offer set forth
therein, the " _French Offer_ "), including the price specified therein (the "
_France Purchase Price_ "), Purchaser has irrevocably offered to acquire the
French and Spanish Shares (within the time limit set forth therein) and to
have the provisions of this Agreement apply to such French and Spanish Shares
following completion of the consultation process described in _Section
1.9(a)(i)_. Subject to acceptance of the French Offer by Seller following
completion of the consultation process described in _Section 1.9(a)(i)_, and
upon delivery to Purchaser of the executed acceptance notice attached as
Schedule 2 to the French Offer Letter (the " _France Acceptance Notice_ "),
this Agreement shall apply to the French and Spanish Shares and, save as set
forth in clause (z) of the proviso to _Section 1.11(b)_, the French and
Spanish Entities shall be included in the Purchased Entities. On the France
Closing, shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, the France Purchase Price
and the Foreign Closing Documents relating to the French and Spanish shares in
the manner set forth in _Section 1.12_.

 



 

(c) On the terms and conditions set forth in the offer letter attached as
_Exhibit H_ hereto (the " _Dutch Offer Letter_ " and the offer set forth
therein, the " _Dutch Offer_ "), including the price specified therein (the "
_Dutch Purchase Price_ "), Purchaser has irrevocably offered to acquire the
Dutch Shares (within the time limit set forth therein) and to have the
provisions of this Agreement apply to such Dutch Shares following completion
of the consultation process described in _Section 1.9(a)(ii)_. Subject to
acceptance of the Dutch Offer by Seller following completion of the
consultation process described in _Section 1.9(a)(ii)_ and upon delivery to
Purchaser of the executed acceptance notice attached as Schedule 2 to the
Dutch Offer Letter (the " _Dutch Acceptance Notice_ "), this Agreement shall
apply to the Dutch Shares and, save as set forth in clause (z) of the proviso
to _Section 1.11(b)_, the Dutch Entities shall be included in the Purchased
Entities. On the Dutch Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall deliver or cause to
be delivered the Dutch Purchase Price and the Foreign Closing Documents
relating to the Dutch Shares in the manner set forth in _Section 1.12_.

 



 

(d) Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with each other and any
relevant Affiliates in connection with the applicable consultation processes
described in this _Section 1.9_, including (i) Purchaser timely providing any
required information relating to Purchaser, or to any measures envisaged by
Purchaser or as otherwise reasonably requested by Seller in respect of or for
the purpose of such consultation processes and (ii) Seller keeping Purchaser
informed of the status of such consultation and any material developments so
far as they relate to the French Entities or the Dutch Entities. Without
PurchaserÂ’s prior written

 



      
 

 



 

consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
Seller shall not (and shall cause the French entities and the Dutch entities
not to) enter into any material agreement with, or make any material
commitment to, the relevant works council which would bind or impose any
material obligation on Purchaser, the French Entities or the Dutch Entities
after the Closing; _provided_ ; _however_ ; for the avoidance of doubt, that
PurchaserÂ’s consent shall not be required with respect to any matter affecting
only employees of Seller who are not Business Employees. If, as a result of
any such consultation processes, changes to this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, or further arrangements in connection with the Transaction, are
considered necessary by Seller, Seller shall negotiate in good faith with
Purchaser on such changes (if any) to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
or further arrangements (if any) in connection with the Transaction that are
appropriate, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
French Offer Letter and/or the Dutch Offer Letter (as applicable).

 



 

(e) Seller and Purchaser shall, and Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause Rexam to, cooperate in connection with any notification to,
or any consultation with, employees of Seller, Rexam or of their Affiliates
who are not included in or covered by the notice and consultation processes
referred to in _Section 1.9(d)_ and who might be affected by the
Restructuring or the Transaction and such employeesÂ’ Employee Representative
Bodies, labor boards and relevant government agencies concerning the
Restructuring and the Transaction, whether required by Law or otherwise
undertaken by Seller, Rexam or their Affiliates. Purchaser shall timely
provide Seller and its relevant Affiliates any information required or
reasonably requested by Seller or Rexam relating to Purchaser and its plans
for employees in connection with any such notification or consultation. Prior
to the Closing Date, all communications between Purchaser and any Employee
Representative Body or group of Business Employees shall be coordinated and
agreed with the Person(s) set forth on _Schedule 1.9(e)_.

 



 

1.10 _Tax Treatment of Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall cooperate in good faith with Purchaser to assist Purchaser in
obtaining information reasonably necessary for Purchaser to prepare the
Preliminary Allocation (as defined in subsection (b) below). Without limiting
the foregoing, Seller shall provide to Purchaser such information available to
Seller (or which Seller may obtain through commercially reasonable efforts)
within seven (7) days following written request by Purchaser to assist
Purchaser in preparing the Preliminary Allocation.

 



 

(b) No later than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser
shall deliver a draft allocation of the Purchase Price among the Conveyed
Purchased Entities set forth in _Schedule 10.1(b)_ and the other Purchased
Assets to be sold directly by Seller and the Rexam Entities to Purchaser and
its designated Affiliates hereunder (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any Purchased Assets to the extent held indirectly held by a Conveyed
Purchased Entity) (the " _Preliminary Allocation_ "). If Seller disagrees with
the Preliminary Allocation, Seller may, within fifteen (15) days after
delivery of the Preliminary Allocation, deliver a notice (the " _Seller Â’s
Allocation Notice_") to Purchaser to such effect, specifying those items as to
which Seller disagrees and setting forth SellerÂ’s proposed allocation. Seller
and Purchaser shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such delivery, use
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine the

 



      
 

 



 

allocation of the Purchase Price. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach
such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause the Arbiter to resolve
any remaining disputed items, if reasonably practicable, at least ten (10)
days prior to the Closing. The Preliminary Allocation as prepared by Purchaser
if no SellerÂ’s Allocation Notice has been given, as adjusted pursuant to any
agreement between Seller and Purchaser or as determined by the Arbiter (the
"Closing Allocation") shall be conclusive and used by the Parties for purposes
of the Closing. If the Closing Allocation is not determined prior to the
Closing, the Purchase Price shall be allocated for purposes of the Closing in
accordance with the Preliminary Allocation, or such other allocation as
Purchaser and Seller agree to in writing for purposes of the Closing (and
adjustments shall be made thereafter as agreed or determined by the Arbiter to
reflect any differences between such allocation and the Closing Allocation).

 



 

(c) Seller and Purchaser agree to further apportion and, as applicable, to
cause their relevant Affiliates to further apportion, the Purchase Price (as
allocated in the Closing Allocation) and any other items that are treated as
additional consideration for Tax purposes among the Purchased Assets
(including among the Purchased Equity) in a manner consistent with the Closing
Allocation and in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and applicable rules in the jurisdiction in
which the Purchased Assets are located (the " _Apportionment Principles_ ")
and the procedures as set forth herein. No later than ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a proposed apportionment
of the Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as additional
consideration for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date determined in a manner
consistent with the Closing Allocation and the Apportionment Principles (the "
_Interim Apportionment_ "). If Seller disagrees with the Interim
Apportionment, Seller may, within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the
Interim Apportionment, deliver a notice (the " _Seller Â’s Apportionment
Notice_") to Purchaser to such effect, specifying those items as to which
Seller disagrees and setting forth SellerÂ’s proposed apportionment.

 



 

(d) If the SellerÂ’s Apportionment Notice is duly delivered, Seller and
Purchaser shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such delivery, use
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine the allocation of the Purchase Price and any
other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes. If
Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly
thereafter cause the Arbiter to resolve any remaining disputes. Any
apportionment of the Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as
additional consideration for Tax purposes determined pursuant to the decision
of the Arbiter shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the
Apportionment Principles and the Closing Allocation. The Interim
Apportionment, as prepared by Purchaser if the SellerÂ’s Apportionment Notice
has not been given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between Seller and
Purchaser or as determined by the Arbiter (the " _Final Apportionment_ "),
shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. No Party shall (and each shall
cause their respective Affiliates not to) take any position inconsistent with
the Final Apportionment on any Tax Return or in any Tax proceeding, in each
case (i) except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision
of state, local or foreign law) or pursuant to any other applicable Laws or
(ii) without the consent of the other Party. Any subsequent adjustments to the
Purchase Price including pursuant to _Section 1.6_ shall be allocated among
the Purchased Assets in a manner that is consistent with the Final
Apportionment.

 



      
 

 



 

1.11 _Closing_.

 



 

(a) The Closing shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP, 4 Times Square, New York, New York, 10036, on the same day
as the date on which the Rexam Transaction is consummated (but after the
consummation of the Rexam Transaction); _provided_ that if each of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (excluding conditions that, by their
terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but the Closing shall be subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall not have been
satisfied as of such date, then the Closing shall occur on the first (1st)
Business Day after such conditions shall have been satisfied or waived, or at
such other time or date as Purchaser and Seller may mutually agree in writing
(the date on which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

 



 

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that in order to comply with applicable
Law in the jurisdictions where the Purchased Assets are located, the Closing
may take place at a different date and time in different jurisdictions. In
particular, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) conditions to the
transfer of (x) the French and Spanish Shares set forth in the French Offer
Letter or (y) the Dutch Shares set forth in the Dutch Offer Letter may, in
each case, be satisfied after the conditions to the transfer of other
Purchased Assets set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied and in any
such case Closing shall take place with respect to all Purchased Assets other
than the French and Spanish Shares and/or Dutch Shares, as applicable (the "
_First Closing_ "), and (ii) (x) the consummation of the sale of the French
and Spanish Shares (the " _France Closing_ ") shall occur in accordance with
the terms of the French Offer Letter and (y) the consummation of the sale of
the Dutch Shares (the " _Dutch Closing_ ") shall occur in accordance with the
terms of the Dutch Offer Letter. The Parties further acknowledge and agree
that (1) subject to the subsequent clause (2) of this sentence, all actions
and documents relating to the transfer of the French and Spanish Shares and/or
the Dutch Shares, as applicable (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Foreign Closing Documents relating to the French and Spanish Shares and/or the
Dutch Shares, as applicable), shall not be required to be taken or delivered
at the First Closing but only at the France Closing and/or the Dutch Closing,
as applicable; (2) all references to Net Debt, Purchased Working Capital and
any other items taken into account in the Purchase Price adjustment in
accordance with this Agreement shall not be adjusted to reflect the exclusion
of the French and Spanish Shares and the Dutch Shares, as applicable, at the
First Closing but shall be reflected as if the France Closing and the Dutch
Closing shall have occurred at the First Closing; and (3) unless otherwise
indicated in this _Section 1.11(b)_, all references to the Closing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the First Closing. To the extent that
the France Closing and/or the Dutch Closing shall not have occurred
simultaneously with the First Closing, the covenants set forth in Article IV
(other than _Sections 4.2_ , _4.3(d)_ , _4.4_ , _4.5_ , _4.9_ , _4.10_ ,
_4.12_ , _4.15_ , _4.16_ , _4.17_ , _4.18_ , _4.19_ and _4.20_ ) shall apply
with respect to the French and Spanish Entities or the Dutch Entities (as
applicable) from the date of the France Acceptance Notice or Dutch Acceptance
Notice (as applicable) until the France Closing or Dutch Closing (as
applicable); _provided_ , _however_ , that (y) in no event shall any violation
of such covenants during the period following the First Closing until the
France Closing or Dutch Closing (as applicable) affect the requirement to
effect the France Closing or Dutch Closing (as applicable) but shall only
result, if applicable, in a claim for indemnification under _Section
9.2(a)(i)(i)(B)_ or _Section 9.2(b)(i)(B)_, as applicable, and (z) for the
purposes of the covenants set forth in Section 4.7 only, the French and
Spanish Entities and Dutch Entities shall be deemed to be Purchased Entities
only upon occurrence of the France closing and Dutch Closing (as applicable).

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 1.11(b)_, for the purposes of this Agreement and
unless Purchaser and Seller agree otherwise, the Closing shall be deemed to
have occurred at 12:01 A.M. local time in each applicable jurisdiction on the
Closing Date, or, if the Rexam Transaction shall have been consummated on the
Closing Date, one minute after consummation of the Rexam Transaction.

 



 

1.12 _Closing Deliveries_. At the Closing,

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Seller:

Entities or the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to this

1.13 _Non-Assignment; Consents_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer, convey or deliver
a Purchased Asset or for Purchaser to assume an Assumed Liability if a sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance, delivery or assumption thereof (i) would be
prohibited by Law or (ii) would, without the approval, authorization or
consent of, filing with, notification to, or granting or issuance of any
order, waiver or Permit by, any relevant Person (collectively, " _Approvals_
"), (A) constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or of any Contract
related to the Business or (B) be ineffective, void or voidable, in the case
of each of clause (A) and (B) unless and until such Approval is obtained.

 



 

(b) If the Closing occurs and the circumstances described in _Section
1.13(a)_ exist, Seller and Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any Approval required to
sell, assign or transfer any Purchased Asset to Purchaser and to obtain the
unconditional release of the Seller Entities and/or the Rexam Entities so that
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the Assumed Liabilities; _provided_
, that nothing in this Agreement shall obligate or in any way require
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to expend money, commence any litigation or
offer or grant any material accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
third party in connection with obtaining any Approval. Seller shall keep
Purchaser reasonably informed in a timely manner as to all material
developments regarding the Approvals and the Purchased Assets. If any such
Approval is not obtained prior to Closing, then from the Closing through the
earlier of (i) such time as such Approval or Approvals are obtained and (ii)
December 31, 2018, Seller and Purchaser will put in place any arrangement
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller (with any appropriate
"firewalls" or similar procedures required under applicable
Competition/Investment Laws) intended to both (x) provide Purchaser, to the
fullest extent practicable, the claims, rights and benefits of any such
Purchased Assets (including by means of any contract manufacturing, co-
packing, subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement) and (y) cause
Purchaser to bear all Assumed Liabilities thereunder in accordance with this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to Customer Contracts
included in the Purchased Assets (including Shared Contracts described in
_Section 1.13(c)_), Seller shall, if not prohibited by applicable regulatory
authorities pursuant to Competition/Investment Law, seek to substitute
approximately equivalent volume if the customer party to the applicable
Customer Contract does not provide Approval prior to Closing. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce, at the request (and for the
benefit) of Purchaser, any rights of Seller, the Seller Entities, Rexam or the
Rexam Entities, as applicable, arising from any such Purchased Asset to the
extent such rights are related to the Business.

 



 

(c) Any Contract to be assigned, transferred and conveyed in accordance with
_Section 1.1(b)(i)_ (or that would be indirectly conveyed to Purchaser under
_Section 1.1(a)(i)_) that is not exclusively related to the Business (each, a
" _Shared Contract_ ") shall be assigned, transferred and conveyed only with
respect to (and preserving the meaning of) those parts that relate to the
Business to the extent so related to the Business, to Purchaser, if so
assignable, transferable or conveyable, or appropriately amended or split
prior to or on the Closing, so that at the Closing (x) Purchaser shall be
entitled to the rights and benefits of those parts of the Shared Contract that
relate to the Business and shall assume the related portion of any Liabilities
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Purchaser Portion of the Shared
Contract Liabilities_ ") and

 



      
 

 



 

(y) Seller (or its applicable Affiliate) shall be entitled to the rights and
benefits of those parts of the Shared Contract other than those related to the
Business and shall assume or retain the related portion of any Liabilities
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Seller Portion of the Shared Contract
Liabilities_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall any
Person be required to assign (or amend or split), either in its entirety or in
part, any Shared Contract that is not assignable (or cannot be amended or
split) by its terms without obtaining required Approvals and (ii) if any
Shared Contract cannot be so partially assigned or split by its terms or
otherwise, or cannot be amended, without such Approval or Approvals, then
(subject to the regulatory requirements described in _Section 1.13(b)_) from
the Closing through the earlier of (1) such time as such Approval or Approvals
are obtained, and (2) December 31, 2018, Seller and Purchaser will establish
an agency, contract manufacturing, co-packing or other similar arrangement
reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser (with any appropriate
"firewalls" or similar procedures required under applicable
Competition/Investment Laws) intended (I) with respect to Shared Contracts
other than those that are indirectly conveyed to Purchaser under _Section
1.1(b)(i)_, to both (x) provide Purchaser, to the fullest extent practicable
under such Shared Contract, the claims, rights and benefits of those parts
that relate to the Business (including by means of any contract manufacturing,
co-packing, subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement) and (y)
cause Purchaser to bear the Assumed Liabilities thereunder from and after the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement to the extent that Purchaser
receives the rights and benefits of the parts of the Shared Contracts that
relate to the Business and (II) with respect to Shared Contracts that are
indirectly conveyed to Purchaser under _Section 1.1(b)(i)_, to both (x)
provide Seller (or its applicable Affiliate), to the fullest extent
practicable under such Shared Contract, the claims, rights and benefits of
those parts that do not relate to the Business (including by means of any
contract manufacturing, co-packing, subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing
arrangement) and (y) cause Seller (or its applicable Affiliate) to bear the
Excluded Liabilities thereunder from and after the Closing in accordance with
this Agreement to the extent that Seller (or its applicable Affiliate)
receives the rights and benefits of the parts of the Shared Contracts that do
not relate to the Business. In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) Purchaser
will promptly pay, perform or discharge when due any Assumed Liability arising
thereunder after the Closing Date to the extent that Purchaser receives the
rights and benefits of the parts of such Shared Contracts that relate to the
Business and (ii) Seller (or its applicable Affiliate) will promptly pay,
perform or discharge when due any Excluded Liability arising thereunder after
the Closing Date to the extent that Seller (or its applicable Affiliate)
receives the rights and benefits of the parts of such Shared Contracts that do
not relate to the Business. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to enforce, at the request (and for the benefit) of Purchaser, any rights of
Seller, the Seller Entities, Rexam or the Rexam Entities, as applicable,
arising from the portion of any Shared Contract that is not assigned or
transferred to Purchaser to the extent such rights are related to the
Business. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce, at
the request (and for the benefit) of Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable,
arising from the portion of any Shared Contract that is not assigned or
transferred to (or otherwise retained by) Seller or its Affiliates to the
extent such rights are not related to the Business.

 



 

(d) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law (and to the extent
consistent with the relevant arrangement agreed to by Seller and Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 1.13(b)_ or _1.13(c)_ ), Seller and Purchaser agree to
treat and report, and to cause their respective Affiliates to treat and
report, on their Tax Returns, (i) the Purchased Assets that are

 



       
 

 



 

subject to the provisions of this _Section 1.13_ (the " _Non-Transferred
Purchaser Assets_ ") as assets owned by Purchaser or its Affiliates and (ii)
the Excluded Assets that are subject to the provisions of this _Section 1.13_
(the " _Non-Transferred Seller Assets_ ") as assets owned by Seller or its
Affiliates. Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees to notify the other Party
promptly in writing if it determines that such treatment (to the extent
consistent with the relevant arrangement agreed to by Seller and Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 1.13(b)_ or _1.13(c)_ ) is not permitted under
applicable Laws. Where such treatment is not permitted under applicable Law,
and subject to the terms of any relevant arrangement agreed to by Seller and
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 1.13(b)_ or _1.13(c)_ , (i) the amount of the
Taxes imposed on Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to any Non-
Transferred Purchaser Asset for any Post-Closing Tax Period, if any, for which
Purchaser is responsible shall be calculated on a "with and without" basis and
Purchaser shall pay such amounts over to Seller and (ii) the amount of the
Taxes imposed on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with respect to any Non-
Transferred Seller Asset for any Post **-** Closing Tax Period, if any, for
which Seller is responsible shall be calculated on a "with and without" basis
and Seller shall pay such amounts over to Purchaser. Seller shall provide, and
shall cause its Affiliates to provide, Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity
to review the relevant portion of any applicable Tax Returns relating to any
Non-Transferred Purchaser Assets (and accompanying schedules, calculations and
other reasonably requested work papers) as necessary for determining the
amount of such Taxes; _provided however_ , that, in the case of Tax Returns of
Seller, Rexam or any of their Affiliates (or of a consolidated, combined,
unitary or Tax group including any of them), Seller may, in lieu of delivering
the Tax Returns, deliver to Purchaser pro-forma statements setting forth in
sufficient detail the information relevant for determining the amount of such
Taxes. Purchaser shall provide, and shall cause its Affiliates to provide,
Seller with a reasonable opportunity to review the relevant portion of any
applicable Tax Returns relating to any Non-Transferred Seller Assets (and
accompanying schedules, calculations and other reasonably requested work
papers) as necessary for determining the amount of such Taxes; _provided
however_ , that, in the case of Tax Returns of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (or of a consolidated, combined, unitary or Tax group including any
of them), Purchaser may, in lieu of delivering the Tax Returns, deliver to
Seller pro-forma statements setting forth in sufficient detail the information
relevant for determining the amount of such Taxes. If Seller and Purchaser are
unable to reach an agreement in respect of any dispute concerning the amount
of such Taxes, they shall promptly submit any such dispute for resolution to
the Arbiter. All costs and expenses of the Arbiter shall be borne equally by
Seller and Purchaser.

 



 

1.14 _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause to be deducted and withheld, from any and all amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
under any applicable Tax Law (taking into account any administrative guidance
issued by any Taxing Authority), _provided_ that Purchaser shall give five (5)
Business DaysÂ’ notice to Seller prior to making any such withholding. Seller
and Purchaser shall cooperate to quantify any such withholding obligation and
shall provide any reasonably requested information with respect thereto no
less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which such withholding
is required. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld,
Purchaser shall (i) pay to the competent Taxing Authority the full amount
required to be so deducted or withheld and (ii) promptly forward to Seller an
official receipt or other documentation reasonably necessary to evidence such
payment. Such amounts so deducted and withheld and paid over to the applicable
Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 



 

1.15 _Additional Purchase Price Adjustment._

 



 

(a) Seller acknowledges that the fundamental economic benefits that Purchaser
expects to receive from the Transaction are predicated on the Business having
a sales perimeter of at least the 2017 Volume Threshold Amount in the 2017
calendar year, and that the covenants and agreements set forth in this
_Section 1.15_ are essential to allow Purchaser to achieve these fundamental
economic benefits.

 



 

(b) Set forth on _Schedule 1.15(b)_ is a list of the identified volume of
cans and ends (" _Units_ ") expected to be sold by the Business in the 2017
calendar year, including the customers to which such Units will be sold, the
Facility in which such Units are manufactured and from which they will be
shipped to such customers.

 



 

(c) As promptly as practicable after December 31, 2017 (but in any event by
March 15, 2018), Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a report (the " _2017
Actual Volume Report_ ") setting forth the aggregate number of Units actually
sold, brokered, assigned to, or contract manufactured by Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities) from the Facilities during the
2017 calendar year (the " _2017 Actual Volume_ "). If Seller has any
objections to the amounts reflected in the 2017 Actual Volume Report, it shall
notify Purchaser in writing of its objections within 30 days of its receipt of
such report, in which case, the provisions of _Section 1.6(e)_ shall apply
_mutatis mutandi_ to the resolution of any such dispute. If Seller has not
objected to such report within such 30 day period, the 2017 Actual Volume
shall be deemed to be as reflected in such report delivered by Purchaser.

 



 

(d) If the 2017 Actual Volume is deemed or determined to be less than the 2017
Volume Threshold Amount, then no later than 10 Business Days following the
later of (i) SellerÂ’s receipt of such report (if Seller has not objected
thereto) or (ii) the final determination of the 2017 Actual Volume in
accordance with _Section 1.15(c)_, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount
equal to the 2017 Volume Shortfall Amount; _provided_ that in no event shall
the payment to be made by Seller to Purchaser under this subsection (d) exceed
$75 million.

 



 

(e) If the 2017 Actual Volume is deemed or determined to be greater than the
2017 Volume Threshold Amount then, subject to _Section 1.15(f)_, no later
than 10 Business Days following the later of (i) SellerÂ’s receipt of such
report (if Seller has not objected thereto) or (ii) the final determination of
the 2017 Actual Volume in accordance with _Section 1.15(c)_, Purchaser shall
pay to Seller an amount equal to the 2017 Volume Surplus Amount; _provided_
that in no event shall the payment to be made by Purchaser to Seller under
this subsection (e) exceed $75 million.

 



 

(f) If Purchaser determines, and so notifies Seller in writing, that the 2017
Actual Volume has been reduced as a direct result of the sale by Seller or any
of its Affiliates of Units to any of the customers at the customer locations
listed on _Schedule 1.15(b)_ with respect to such customers (as reflected in
the 2017 Actual Volume Report and subject to the dispute resolution provisions
described in _Section 1.15(c)_), then, subject to _Section 1.15(d)_ (but
without

 



      
 

 



 

duplication of any volumes attributable to payments made thereunder), no later
than 10 Business Days following the later of (i) SellerÂ’s receipt of such
report (if Seller has not objected thereto) or (ii) the final determination of
the number of Units so sold by Seller or any of its Affiliates in accordance
with _Section 1.15(c)_, Seller shall pay to Purchaser (x) the Seller Volume
Payment Amount; _provided_ that the amount (if any) payable by Seller to
Purchaser under _Section 1.15(d)_ and this _Section 1.15(f)_ shall be
reduced by, or to the extent there is no amount payable by Seller to Purchaser
under _Section 1.15(d)_ or this _Section 1.15(f)_ (after taking into account
the reduction (if any) to any amount payable by Seller to Purchaser as a
result of the application of this proviso), Purchaser shall pay to Seller
(solely to the extent a reduction (if any) for such amount payable has not
already been made hereunder), the Purchaser Volume Payment Amount with respect
to any Units sold by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Purchased
Entities) in the 2017 calendar year from volume expected to be retained by
Seller or its Affiliates in 2017 after giving effect to the Transaction (the "
_Seller Retained Volume_ "). If Seller determines, and so notifies Purchaser
in writing, that Purchaser is required to make a payment to Seller under this
_Section 1.15(f)_, it shall, as promptly as practicable after December 31,
2017 (but in any event by March 15, 2018), deliver a report to Purchaser
setting forth its determination of the Seller Retained Volume (the " _Seller
Retained Volume Report_ "). If Purchaser has any objections to such report, it
shall notify Seller in writing of its objections within 30 days of its receipt
of such report, in which case the provisions of _Section 1.6(e)_ shall apply
_mutatis mutandi_ to the resolution of any such dispute. The payments required
to be made by Purchaser under this subsection (e) shall be made no later than
10 Business Days following the later of (i) PurchaserÂ’s receipt of the Seller
Retained Volume Report (if Purchaser has not objected thereto) or (ii) the
final determination of the amount of Seller Retained Volume.

 



 

(g) If, with respect to any volume of Units, Purchaser is required to make
payments to Seller under both _Section 1.15(e)_ and _Section 1.15(f)_, or
Seller is required to make payments to Purchaser under both _Section 1.15(d)_
and _Section 1.15(f)_, Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, shall first
satisfy its obligations under _Section 1.15(d)_ or _Section 1.15(e)_, as
applicable, before making any payment under _Section 1.15(f)_; _provided_
that in no event shall Purchaser or Seller be required to make payments under
both _Section 1.15(e)_ and _Section 1.15(f)_ or _Section 1.15(d)_ and
_Section 1.15(f)_, as applicable, with respect to the same volume of Units.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, effect or permit any of the
following, and PurchaserÂ’s right to receive any potential payment from Seller
under _Section 1.15(d)_ shall irrevocably terminate if Purchaser or its
applicable Affiliate (x) takes any action with the primary intent of
artificially preventing or decreasing the amount of any payments potentially
due to Seller under _Section 1.15(e)_ (or increasing the payments potentially
due to Purchaser under _Section 1.15(d)_) (including any action to delay
sales of Units until after the end of the 2017 calendar year), (y) acts in bad
faith with respect to attaining any volume of cans or ends for the purpose of
reducing the payments potentially due to Seller (or increasing the payments
potentially due to Purchaser) under _Section 1.15(e)_ or _Section 1.15(d)_,
or (z) fails to conduct the Business in a manner generally consistent with the
efforts and resources that Purchaser and its Affiliates would devote to its
other operations and businesses similarly situated to the Business absent
_Section 1.15(d)_ and _Section 1.15(e)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) The payments to be made by Purchaser or Seller pursuant to this _Section
1.15_ shall be treated in all respects as adjustments to the Purchase Price,
and shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Seller or Purchaser to the other
no fewer than three Business Days prior to the scheduled date of such payment.

 



 

(j) Purchaser and Seller agree that to the extent any of the information to be
exchanged between them pursuant to this _Section 1.15_ for purposes of
determining any payments due to each other hereunder is competitively
sensitive, such information will be disclosed only to specifically identified
employees of Seller or Purchaser who do not have day-to-day pricing or
strategic responsibilities, as applicable, or third party Representatives of
either of them. Seller and Purchaser will cooperate to identify any such
competitively sensitive information and to ensure that such information is
reviewed only by such specifically identified employees who do not have day-
to-day pricing or strategic responsibilities or third party Representatives.

corporate or similar organizational power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to carry out their respective obligations hereunder and to

requisite corporate action on the part of such Affiliates. The Ancillary
Agreements will be duly executed and delivered by the applicable Affiliates of
Purchaser, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other
parties thereto will be valid and binding obligations of such Affiliates,
enforceable against them in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Law relating to creditorsÂ’ rights generally and general
principles of equity.

 



 

3.2 _No Conflicts_. Assuming that all Consents have been obtained and except
as may result from any facts or circumstances relating to Seller, Rexam, the
Seller Entities, the Rexam Entities or the Purchased Entities, the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser does not, the execution, delivery
and performance of the Ancillary Agreements by the applicable Affiliates of
Purchaser will not, and the consummation of the Transaction by Purchaser will
not (a) violate, conflict with or result in the breach of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of Purchaser or
such Affiliates, (b) conflict with or violate any Law or Governmental Order
applicable to Purchaser or such Affiliates or (c) conflict with, result in any
breach of, constitute a default (or event which with the giving of notice or
lapse of time, or both, would become a default) under, require any consent
under, or give to others any rights to, or result in termination,
cancellation, or acceleration of any obligation under, or result in the

 



      
 

 



 

creation of an Encumbrance under, any Contract to which Purchaser or such
Affiliates are a party, except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (b) and
(c), for any of the foregoing that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
performance by Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement or the
performance by such Affiliates of their obligations under the applicable
Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

3.3 _Governmental Consents and Approvals_. Except for filings with the EC,
CADE and the FTC contemplated by the Clearances in connection with the Rexam
Transaction and a filing with the EC in connection with the Transaction, no
Consent of, action by, filing with or notification to any Governmental
Authority is required for the consummation by Purchaser of the Transaction,
except where the failure to obtain such Consent or action or to make such
filing or notification would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay the performance by Purchaser of its
obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

3.4 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, no Action by or against
Purchaser is pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened in writing,
challenging the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transaction, in each case that, if upheld, would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transaction by Purchaser. As of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser is not
subject to any Governmental Order (nor, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, is
there any such Governmental Order threatened in writing to be imposed by any
Governmental Authority) which could, individually or in the aggregate, be or
reasonably be expected to be, materially adverse to the ability of Purchaser
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the Transaction.

 



 

3.5 _Acquisition of Equity for Investment_. Purchaser (or one or more of its
Affiliates) will acquire the Interests and Purchased Affiliate Interests for
investment purposes and not with a view toward or for offer or sale in
connection with any distribution thereof, or with any present intention of
offering, distributing or selling any of the Interests or Purchased Affiliate
Interests. Purchaser acknowledges that the Interests and Purchased Affiliate
Interests have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Securities Act_ "), or any state securities Laws, and agrees that the
Interests and Purchased Affiliate Interests may not be sold, transferred,
offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from
such registration available, or in a transaction not subject to registration,
under the Securities Act and without compliance with foreign securities Laws,
in each case, to the extent applicable. Purchaser (or its applicable
Affiliate) is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 under
the Securities Act, and any Interests or Purchased Affiliate Interests that
Purchaser or its Affiliates receive hereunder will be received only on its own
behalf and not for the account or benefit of any other person or entity. Each
of Purchaser and its applicable Affiliates is able to bear the economic risk
of holding the Interests and Purchased Affiliate Interests for an indefinite
period (including total loss of its investment).

 



 

3.6 _Acquisition of Rexam Securities_. Neither Purchaser nor any Person Acting
in Concert with Purchaser has acquired any Interest in Securities of Rexam in
the twelve (12) months prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

3.7 _Brokers_. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the fees and expenses
of any broker, finder or investment banker entitled to any brokerage, finderÂ’s
or other fee or commission in connection with the Transaction based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser.

 



 

3.8 _Financing_. Purchaser has, as of the date of this Agreement, committed
financing (the " _Financing_ ") pursuant to an executed commitment letter (the
" _Commitment Letter_ ") to which an agreed version of an interim loan
agreement is attached, and an executed fee letter, in each case dated on or
prior to the date of this Agreement, among one or more substantially wholly
owned Affiliates controlled by Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Financing Parties_
") and the Financing Sources, copies of which have been provided to Seller
(with the fee letter redacted in a customary manner solely with respect to fee
amounts and economic terms (and none of the redacted provisions would allow
the Financing Sources to reduce the amount of funding to be provided under the
Financing Documents or the conditions on which such funding is available))
(the " _Financing Documents_ "), the proceeds of which shall be on-lent or
otherwise transferred by the Purchaser Financing Parties to Purchaser or each
substantially wholly owned Affiliate controlled by Purchaser that will
purchase Purchased Assets at or prior to Closing in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement (the " _Purchasing Entities_ "), in each case pursuant to
_Section 4.18(b)(B)_ and the terms of one or more intercompany financing
agreements. All conditions precedent to the funding (the " _Financing
Conditions Precedent_ ") are set forth in the Financing Documents, and at
Closing Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing Entities will (subject to
satisfaction of the Financing Conditions Precedent) have the necessary cash
resources to pay the Closing Purchase Price and meet all of PurchaserÂ’s
financial obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. As of
the date of this Agreement, (i) there are no conditions precedent related to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing, and (ii) there are no, and
there are not contemplated to be any, agreements, side letters or arrangements
relating to (a) the conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing or (b) any reduction of the amount of the Financing, in each
case other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Documents. None of the
Financing Documents have been amended, restated or otherwise modified or
waived prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the
respective commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, rescinded,
amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect prior to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, each of the
Financing Documents is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Purchaser Financing Parties (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally and general
principles of equity), and to the Knowledge of Purchaser, each of the other
parties thereto, and enforceable against the Purchaser Financing Parties, and,
to the Knowledge of Purchaser, each of the other parties thereto, in
accordance with its terms. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which would constitute a breach or default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default) or prevent any of
the Financing Conditions Precedent from being satisfied, in each case on the
part of the Purchaser Financing Parties, or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser,
any other parties thereto, under the Financing Documents. As of the date of
this Agreement, Purchaser does not have any reason to believe that (x) any of
the Financing Conditions Precedent will not be satisfied, or (y) the Financing
will not be available to any of Purchaser, the Purchaser Financing Parties and
the Purchasing Entities at Closing. Purchaser has fully paid, or caused to be
fully paid, all commitment fees and other fees to the extent required to be
paid on or prior to

 



      
 

 



 

the date of this Agreement in connection with the Financing. Except as
permitted by _Section 4.18_, Purchaser shall not agree, nor shall it allow
any of its Affiliates or Representatives to agree, to amend the terms of, or
waive any term of or right under, any of the Financing Documents and shall not
take any action or omit to take any action, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives not to take any action or omit to take any action, which would
impair or restrict its ability to enforce its rights or the rights of the
Purchaser Financing Parties thereunder in any manner. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
obtaining of the Financing is not a condition to Closing or the consummation
of the Transaction, and that, irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Financing, Purchaser shall be obligated to pay the Closing
Purchase Price and meet all its financial obligations under this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_.

 



 

3.9 _Investigation_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has made
its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities
and the Business and (b) has been furnished with or given access to such
information about the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the
Business as it has requested. Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that
(i) the only representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by
Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives are the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements made in this Agreement, (ii) except as
set forth in _Article II_, none of Seller, Rexam or any of their respective
Affiliates or its Representatives makes any other representation or warranty
of any kind or nature whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, with
respect to Seller, the Seller Entities, the Rexam Entities, the Purchased
Entities, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Business, this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby), including representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
relating to the financial condition, results of operations, assets or
Liabilities of any of the foregoing entities and (iii) none of Seller, Rexam
nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives makes any
representation or warranty as to (A) the operation of the Business by
Purchaser after the Closing in any manner or (B) the probable success or
profitability of the Business (whether before or after the Closing). Except
for the representations and warranties contained in _Article II_, neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates have relied upon any other representations
or warranties or any other information made or supplied by or on behalf of
Seller, Rexam or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, and
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that none of Seller, Rexam, their respective
Affiliates or Representatives has any liability or responsibility for any
other representation, warranty, opinion, projection, forecast, advice,
statement or information made, communicated or furnished (orally or in
writing) to Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives
(including any opinion, projection, forecast, advice, statement or information
that may have been or may be provided to Purchaser by any Affiliate or
Representative of Purchaser). Except to the extent Purchaser has otherwise
advised Seller in writing, as of the date of this Agreement and to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates or
Representatives is aware of (x) any of the representations or warranties
contained in _Article II_ being untrue or incorrect or (y) any material
errors in, or material omissions from, the Seller Disclosure Letter.

4.2 _Prior Notice to Invoke Certain Conditions_. On the Confirmation Date (no

to Seller if Purchaser considers any of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.1(a)_, _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ not to be satisfied at the
Confirmation Date and intends to invoke such condition (in such case,
providing reasonable details of the event which has occurred, or circumstance
which has arisen, which it considers as being sufficiently material to permit
Purchaser to invoke the relevant condition(s)). Without prejudice to
PurchaserÂ’s and SellerÂ’s rights set forth in _Section 7.3_, if any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_, _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section
7.1(d)_ are not invoked by provision of the notice pursuant to the previous
sentence, such conditions shall at such time be deemed irrevocably waived and
may not thereafter be invoked by Purchaser. Seller shall inform Purchaser of
the Unconditional Offer Date by written notice delivered to Purchaser at least

Hearing or the date of the Sanction Hearing is delayed, rescheduled or
otherwise adjourned to a later date, any deemed waiver of all or any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ by Purchaser pursuant to this _Section
4.2_ shall be automatically rescinded and shall be null and void, and the
obligations of Purchaser and Seller set forth in this _Section 4.2_ shall
remain applicable with respect to the date to which the Unconditional Date has
been delayed, rescheduled or adjourned and the corresponding Confirmation
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the condition in _Section 7.1(b)_ has
not been satisfied in all respects on or before the Confirmation Date, this
_Section 4.2_ (together with _Section 8.1(g)_ as it relates to _Section
7.1(b)_) shall not apply to _Section 7.1(b)_.

 



      
 

 



 

4.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

reasonable notice, Seller shall, shall cause its applicable subsidiaries and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Rexam and RexamÂ’s applicable
subsidiaries to: (i) afford Purchaser and its authorized Representatives
reasonable access to the Business Real Property and related Books and Records;
and (ii) furnish to the authorized Representatives of Purchaser such
additional financial and operating data and other information regarding the
Business (or copies thereof) as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably
require in order to prepare for the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such access or furnishing of information shall be scheduled and coordinated
through the Person(s) set forth on _Schedule 4.3_ and shall be conducted at
PurchaserÂ’s expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision of
SellerÂ’s or RexamÂ’s, as applicable, or their AffiliatesÂ’ personnel and in such
a manner as not to interfere with the normal operations of the Business;
_further provided_ , that neither Seller nor Rexam shall be required to
disclose (or cause their respective Affiliates to disclose) any information to
Purchaser if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to: (w) cause
competitive harm to the Business if the Transaction is not consummated; (x)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege; or (y) contravene any
applicable Laws (including any Competition/Investment Law and any applicable
Law relating to data protection), fiduciary duties or Contracts; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
access to the Business Real Property shall not include the right to collect or
otherwise take samples at said properties, including samples of environmental
media such as soils, surface waters, sediments or groundwater, or building
materials.

 



 

(b) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of July 14, 2015,
between Purchaser and Seller (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall
continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such
Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of Purchaser under this _Section
4.3(b)_ shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that, from and after the
Closing, except as would have been permitted under the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives to, treat and hold as confidential, and not
disclose to any Person, information related to the discussions and
negotiations between the Parties regarding this Agreement and the Transaction
and all confidential information relating to Seller and Rexam or their
respective subsidiaries and Affiliates (other than confidential information
relating to the Purchased Entities and the Purchased Assets). If this
Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

(c) Nothing provided to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 4.3(a)_ shall in any
way amend or diminish PurchaserÂ’s obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any information provided to
Purchaser or its Affiliates or their respective Representatives pursuant to
_Section 4.3(a)_ or otherwise by or on behalf of Seller, Rexam or any
Affiliate or Representative of any of them shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(d) From and after the Closing for a period of two (2) years, Seller agrees
to, and shall cause the Seller Entities, Rexam and the Rexam Entities and use
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, (i)
treat and hold as confidential (and not (except as expressly permitted by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement) disclose or provide access to any Person
(other than SellerÂ’s Affiliates and Representatives) to) any confidential and

 



      
 

 



 

proprietary information to the extent relating to the Business and relating to
trade secrets, processes, product development, price, customer and supplier
lists, pricing and marketing plans, policies and strategies, details of client
and consultant contracts, operations methods, product development techniques,
business acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition plans and all other
confidential or proprietary information with respect to the Purchased
Entities, the Purchased Assets or the Business unless such information (A) is
or becomes generally available to, or known by, the public through no
disclosure in violation hereof of Seller or its Affiliates or any of its or
their Representatives, (B) is required to be publicly disclosed by Law or the
rules or regulations of any U.S. or foreign securities exchange or similar
organization, or (C) becomes available to Seller or its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives from and after the Closing, from a third party
source that is not known by Seller to be under any obligations of
confidentiality in respect of such information, (ii) in the event that Seller,
Rexam, any Seller Entity, Rexam Entity or any of their respective
Representative becomes legally compelled to disclose any such information,
provide Purchaser (to the extent permitted by Law and reasonably practicable)
with prompt written notice of such requirement so that Purchaser may seek, at
PurchaserÂ’s sole expense, a protective order or other remedy or waive
compliance with this _Section 4.3(d)_ and (iii) in the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or Purchaser waives
compliance with this _Section 4.3(d)_, furnish only that portion of such
confidential information which is legally required to be provided. In
addition, the foregoing shall not prohibit Seller, its Affiliates or any of
their respective Representatives from using the confidential information
described in _Section 4.3(d)(i)_ for the purpose of complying with the terms
of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or any Contract that has
not been assigned or transferred pursuant to _Section 1.13_. Furthermore, the
provisions of this _Section 4.3(d)_ will not prohibit any retention of copies
of records or any disclosure in connection with the preparation and filing of
financial statements or Tax Returns of Seller or its Affiliates or any
disclosure made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy
relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

4.4 _Non-Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Seller agrees that following the Closing for the applicable periods and in
the geographic locations set forth on _Schedule 4.4(a)_ , none of Seller or
any of its Affiliates will, without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
solicit to employ or hire (whether as an officer, employee or consultant or
other independent contractor) any Transferred Business Employee with an annual
base salary in excess of $100,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
restrictions of this _Section 4.4(a)_ shall not apply (i) to any general
advertisement or any search firm engagement which, in any such case, is not
directed or focused on any such Transferred Business Employee and any
resultant hiring, (ii) the hiring of any such Transferred Business Employee
who directly or indirectly contacts Seller or its Affiliates of her or his own
accord or (iii) the solicitation or hiring of any such Transferred Business
Employee whose employment by or term in office with Purchaser or its
Affiliates is terminated prior to the date of the applicable solicitation.

 



 

(b) Purchaser agrees that following the Closing for the applicable periods and
in the geographic locations set forth on _Schedule 4.4(b)_, none of Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates will, without the prior written consent of Seller,
solicit to employ or hire (whether as an officer, employee or consultant or
other independent contractor) any employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates
(i) to whom Purchaser or any of its Affiliates were introduced or with whom
they

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise had contact in connection with their evaluation of the Transaction
or (ii) with an annual base salary in excess of $100,000 (other than any
Transferred Business Employee); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions
of this _Section 4.4(b)_ shall not apply (x) to any general advertisement or
any search firm engagement which, in any such case, is not directed or focused
on any such employee and any resultant hiring, (y) to the hiring of any such
employee who directly or indirectly contacts Purchaser or its Affiliates of
her or his own accord, or (z) to the solicitation or hiring of any such
employee whose employment by or term in office with Seller or its Affiliates
is terminated prior to the date of the applicable solicitation.

 



 

4.5 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

 



 

(a) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall (and Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause Rexam to) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and assist and
cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary and advisable
(subject to applicable Law) to cause the Closing conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ to be satisfied and to consummate and make effective the
Transaction as soon as practicable in accordance with the terms hereof,
including using reasonable best efforts to obtain promptly all required
Consents of the EC, CADE and the FTC for the Transaction (including to have
issued the ECÂ’s approval decision pursuant to Section 19 of the EC Commitments
and for the approval of Purchaser as the purchaser of the Purchased Assets);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be required to pay any fees or
other payments to any such Governmental Authorities in order to obtain any
such Consent (other than normal filing fees that are imposed by Law on
Seller). Seller and Purchaser shall not, and Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause Rexam not to, knowingly enter into any acquisition or
other agreement, make any announcement with respect to any transaction (except
as required pursuant to applicable Law or the rules of any applicable stock
exchange) or take any other action that could reasonably be expected to have
the effect of materially delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any
Consents of any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transaction. Seller
and Purchaser each agree, to the extent required by applicable Law (including
Competition/Investment Laws), to make, or to cause to be made any required
filing with or notification to the EC, CADE and the FTC with respect to the
Transaction and the approval of Purchaser as the purchaser of the Purchased
Assets as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any
event within any time period imposed by applicable Competition/Investment
Laws, and to supply promptly any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to Competition/Investment Laws
(including, in the case of Purchaser, to promptly make available to the EC,
CADE, the FTC and any other applicable Governmental Authority and the
Monitoring Trustee information and appropriate personnel in response to any
queries made by them that are raised in connection with the Clearances or the
Consents, which may include information regarding this Agreement, PurchaserÂ’s
capabilities as the potential purchaser of the Business, or other matters). If
any objections are asserted with respect to the Transaction under any
Competition/Investment Law or if any suit or proceeding is instituted or
threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging the
Transaction as violative of any Competition/Investment Law, each of Seller and
Purchaser shall (and Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause

In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, take all action, including but not limited to agreeing to hold
separate or to divest any of the Purchased Assets or businesses or properties
or assets of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and to

 



      
 

 



 

terminate any existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations,
as may be required by: (i) the applicable Governmental Authority in order to
resolve such objections as such Governmental Authority may have to such
transactions under any Competition/Investment Law; or (ii) any domestic or
foreign court or other tribunal, in any Action brought by a private party or
Governmental Authority challenging such transactions as violative of any
Competition/Investment Law, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering or reversal of, any order that has
the effect of restricting, preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the
Transaction.

 



 

(b) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Law, each of

to the other Parties of, all correspondence, filings or communications between
them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, relating to the matters
that are the subject of this Agreement and the Transaction and permit the
other Parties to review in advance any proposed correspondence, filings or
communication by such Party to any Governmental Authority relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation,
projections, business plans or prospects of the Purchased Entities, Purchased
Assets or the Business and (ii) as necessary to otherwise comply with
contractual arrangements or applicable Laws, provided that in the case of each
of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), if a Party provides redacted materials
to any other Party, it must also provide on an "outside counsel only" basis a
copy of the same materials without any redactions applied to the legal
advisors of that Party. Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall (and Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause Rexam not to) agree to participate in
any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation (including any settlement of the investigation), litigation or
other inquiry related to the Transaction unless it first uses commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other Parties in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting; _provided_ , _however_
, that Purchaser shall not have the obligation to consult with the other
Parties with respect to, or give the other Parties the opportunity to attend
(other than such PartiesÂ’ respective outside counsel), that portion of any
meeting with any Governmental Authority during which Purchaser reasonably
expects to discuss the valuation, projections, business plans or prospects of
the Purchased Entities, Purchased Assets or the Business. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, each of Seller and Purchaser shall (and Seller
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Rexam to) coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing and in seeking Consents under the applicable
Competition/Investment Laws.

Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Purchased Entities) shall
have no rights (other than as separately agreed by the Parties in writing) to
use any Seller and Rexam Marks other than as expressly provided in this
_Section 4.9_. Any use by Purchaser or any of its controlled Affiliates

any of their Affiliates. Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, following
the Closing, the Purchased Entities) shall, in accordance with the procedures

names of the Purchased Entities (if applicable).

 



 

(f) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at Law for any breach of
the requirements of this _Section 4.9_ would be inadequate, and agrees and
consents that without intending to limit any additional remedies that may be
available (in accordance with _Section 11.9_), Seller shall be entitled to a
temporary or permanent injunction, without proof of actual damage or
inadequacy of legal remedy, and without posting any bond or other undertaking,
in any Action which may be brought to enforce any of the provisions of this
_Section 4.9_.

Rexam Licensed IP solely in the development, manufacture, marketing,
distribution or sale of two-piece metal beverage cans and ends by the Business

actual damage or inadequacy of legal remedy, and without posting any bond or
other undertaking, in any Action which may be brought to enforce any of the
provisions of this _Section 4.10_.

connection with the Business that are Assumed Liabilities (together the "
_Seller Guarantees_ "), and Purchaser shall, in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Article IX_, indemnify Seller, Rexam and their respective

only with the prior written consent of Seller and from the date of this
Agreement until the closing of the Rexam Transaction, of Rexam (with respect

Purchaser from contacting the customers, suppliers and licensors

 



      
 

 



 

of the Business in the ordinary course of PurchaserÂ’s businesses for the
purpose of selling products of PurchaserÂ’s businesses or for any other purpose
unrelated to the Business and the Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser does not discuss this Agreement or the Transaction in doing so.

 



 

4.14 _Distribution of Cash Balances_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall be
permitted to cause the Purchased Entities to distribute any and all cash

use its reasonable efforts to minimize the level of cash and Cash Equivalents
held by the Purchased Entities on the Closing Date.

 



 

4.15 _Weissenthurm Conversion_. At PurchaserÂ’s option, which shall be
exercised, if at all, by Purchaser upon SellerÂ’s receipt of PurchaserÂ’s
written notice of such exercise within two (2) years after the Closing Date,

of Purchaser (only to the extent incurred through the earlier of (a) five (5)
years following the Closing Date or (b) the completion of the conversion
described below) in converting the production lines operating at the Facility
located in Weissenthurm, Germany from steel production to aluminum production,
up to a maximum aggregate reimbursement by Seller of Â€60 million. Any payments
made by Seller in respect of such conversion shall be due within ninety (90)
days of SellerÂ’s receipt of documentation for such reasonable, actually
incurred costs of Purchaser, which documentation shall (at SellerÂ’s sole
option) be subject to reasonable audit by Seller.

 



 

4.16 _Restructuring_. To facilitate the Transaction, from the date of this
Agreement until the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause Rexam to, use its reasonable best efforts to effectuate
the restructuring substantially as outlined in the steps plan set forth in
_Schedule 4.16_ (such steps plan, the " _Restructuring Steps Plan_ " and the
steps outlined therein, the " _Restructuring_ ") prior to the Closing, except
with respect to actions expressly contemplated or permitted by the
Restructuring Steps Plan to take place after the First Closing, with such
changes to the Restructuring Steps Plan as may be requested by any
Governmental Authority or the Monitoring Trustee. Seller shall keep Purchaser
reasonably informed with respect to the status of the Restructuring and shall
make changes to the Restructuring Steps Plan only after prior, good faith
consultation with Purchaser (or its counsel) and after considering in good
faith PurchaserÂ’s views and comments that are provided in a timely manner. If
Purchaser does not consent in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to any such changes to the Restructuring
Steps Plan, then Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Purchased Entities after Closing) harmless from any Loss and
any incremental Taxes for a Post-Closing Tax Period suffered or incurred by
any of them as a result of or arising out of or relating to any such change
unless such change was required by the Monitoring Trustee. Seller and
Purchaser agree that they will, in the twenty (20) day period following the
date of this Agreement, discuss in good faith the optimal structure (from the
viewpoint of each of them) for the restructuring and transfer to Purchaser of
the Purchased Assets located in Brazil, and any resulting amendments to this
Agreement and the

 



      
 

 



 

Restructuring Steps Plan resulting from any change to the structure from that
reflected in this Agreement and the Restructuring Steps Plan on the date
hereof.

 



 

4.17 _Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation_.

time to time after the Closing, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such other documents and
instruments, provide such materials and information and take such other
actions as may reasonably be necessary, proper or advisable, to the extent
permitted by Law, to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and to cause
the Transaction to occur.

 



 

(b) Purchaser and Seller agree that Seller may maintain copies of any Books
and Records or other books and records that are included in the Purchased
Assets and that are delivered to Purchaser hereunder. Purchaser agrees to
retain and maintain such Books and Records or other books and records related
to the Purchased Assets for a period of at least seven (7) years after Closing
or such longer minimum period as is required by applicable Law (plus, in each
case, any additional time during which Purchaser has been advised by Seller
that (i) there is an ongoing Tax audit with respect to periods prior to the
Closing or (ii) any such period is otherwise open to assessment). During any
such period, Purchaser agrees to give Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives reasonable cooperation, access (including copies)
and staff assistance, as needed, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, with respect to the Books and Records or any other books
and records delivered to Purchaser hereunder as may be necessary for general
business purposes, including the defense of litigation, the preparation of Tax
Returns and financial statements and the management and handling of Tax
audits.

 



 

(c) If, following the Closing, any right, property or asset not forming part
of the Purchased Assets is found to have been transferred to Purchaser in
error, either directly or indirectly (including as a result of the
Restructuring), Purchaser shall transfer, or shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Purchased Entities) to transfer, at no cost to Seller or its
Affiliates, such right, property or asset (and any related Liability) as soon
as reasonably practicable to the Affiliate of Seller indicated by Seller. If,
following the Closing, any right, property or asset forming part of the
Purchased Assets is found to have been retained by any Seller Entity or Rexam
Entity in error, either directly or indirectly (including as a result of the
Restructuring), Seller shall transfer, or shall cause the other Seller
Entities to transfer, at no cost to Purchaser, such right, property or asset
(and any related Liability) as soon as reasonably practicable to Purchaser or
an Affiliate of Purchaser (including a Purchased Entity) indicated by
Purchaser.

 



 

4.18 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing is not a condition
to Closing or the consummation of the Transaction, and that, irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing, Purchaser shall be
obligated to pay the Closing Purchase Price and meet all its financial
obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, subject only to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its Affiliates to use
their reasonable best efforts to, take or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to (i)
consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Financing Documents, (ii) maintain in effect and comply, and if applicable
cause its Affiliates to comply, with their respective obligations under the
Financing Documents, (iii) enforce its rights, or cause its Affiliates to
enforce their rights, under the Financing Documents and cause the Financing
Sources to fund the Financing at or prior to Closing in accordance with their
terms and conditions and (iv) no later than the Confirmation Date, satisfy or
obtain the waiver of the Financing Conditions Precedent (other than the
occurrence of the Unconditional Date and Closing and satisfaction of the
Relevant Certain Funds Conditions Precedent) (it being understood that nothing
in this Agreement shall prevent Purchaser or any Purchaser Financing Party
from seeking to obtain alternative financing for the Transaction on better
market, credit, economic or legal terms than those terms described in the
Financing Documents; _provided_ , that no such alternative financing shall
release Purchaser or any Purchaser Financing Party from consummating the
Financing unless and until such alternative financing is funded on the Closing
Date or funded into escrow in accordance with the escrow requirements set
forth in clause (1) below). Purchaser shall not and shall not permit any of
its Affiliates to amend, restate, modify, terminate, replace, or assign all or
a portion of any Financing facilities (or commitments thereof) described in,
or agree to any waiver of any provisions under, any Financing Document, in
each case without the prior written consent of Seller, if such amendment,
restatement, modification, termination, replacement, assignment or waiver (1)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the
amount of fees to be paid) to an amount that is insufficient to consummate the
Transaction (taking into account the available cash resources of Purchaser and
its Affiliates to the extent funded at the time of such reduction into an
escrow account in the name of the applicable Purchaser Financing Party with a
reputable financial institution (presently expected to be an affiliate of the
Financing Sources) reasonably satisfactory to Seller (it being understood that
Citibank, N.A., London Branch is reasonably satisfactory to Seller), that acts
as escrow agent in international financial or capital markets in the ordinary
course of its business, subject to the terms of an escrow agreement customary
for acquisition financings of a similar nature that is reasonably satisfactory
to Seller and consistent with the terms of the Financing Documents, solely for
the purpose of funding the Transaction at Closing and with conditions for the
release of the amounts therein no more onerous than the conditions applicable
to the relevant facility under the Financing Documents), including the payment
of all fees, premiums and expenses associated therewith, (2) imposes new or
additional conditions or any contingencies or otherwise expands upon, amends
or otherwise modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of any portion of
the Financing (including any amendment or modification of the Financing
Conditions Precedent or the Relevant Certain Funds Conditions Precedent), (3)

ensure that no information is released for the purposes of the Financing by or
on behalf of Purchaser or any Purchaser Financing Party without confirmation
from Seller that the information is not material to Rexam shareholders (the "
_Release Confirmation_ "),

 



 

(iii) Solely with respect to information in Financing Marketing Materials
released by or on behalf of Purchaser or any Purchaser Financing Party prior
to May 16, 2016:

 



 

(1) Purchaser and the Purchaser Financing Parties shall be entitled to

(including equity and equity-related incentive compensation) in effect for
such Transferred Employee immediately prior to Closing (provided, however,
that in no event shall Purchaser be required to provide any equity
compensation to the Transferred Employees); (ii) (A) in the case of each U.S.
Transferred Employee, employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are no less
favorable than those in effect for such U.S. Transferred Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date and (B) in the case of Non-U.S. Transferred
Employees, employee benefits that, on an individual basis, are of economically
similar value to those paid or provided to each such Non-U.S. Transferred
Employee by Seller, Rexam or any of their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (iii) notice and
severance benefits that are no less favorable than the notice and severance
benefits that would have been applicable to such Transferred Employee under
the Employee Incentives

 



      
 

 



 

Schedule to the Co-operation Agreement or any applicable severance plans of
Seller, Rexam or Affiliate of Seller or Rexam immediately prior to the Closing
Date, taking into account each such Transferred EmployeeÂ’s additional period
of service and any increase to base salary or wage rate and incentive
compensation opportunity with Purchaser or its Affiliates following the
Closing. Purchaser agrees that it shall not, nor shall it cause or permit any
of its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities) to, in the case of any
Transferred Employee who was previously employed by Rexam or any Rexam Entity,
relocate such employee during the two-year period following the Closing Date
to a work location more than twenty-five (25) miles from the location at which
such employee was employed immediately prior to the Closing without such
personÂ’s consent. This _Section 5.1(b)_ is subject to the Transfer
Regulations and any other applicable Law that protects any Transferred
EmployeeÂ’s acquired rights or otherwise requires Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities) and is without limitation of
Purchaser and its AffiliatesÂ’ ability to provide more generous terms and
conditions, compensation or benefits to the Transferred Employees following
the Closing. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Purchaser and
its Affiliates will have no obligation to continue the employment of any
Transferred Employee for any period following the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Retention Liabilities and Incentives_. The Seller Entities, the Rexam
Entities and their respective Affiliates shall be solely responsible for all
Liabilities related to (i) any outstanding equity awards or equity-related
arrangements granted to Transferred Employees by a Seller Entity or Rexam
Entity on or prior to the Closing Date, with the exception of the ESPP and
(ii) the payment of any cash retention and long and short-term incentive
awards granted by a Seller Entity or Rexam Entity and payable to Transferred
Employees on or before the Closing Date, in each case in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Employee Benefit Plan. Seller shall cause each
outstanding and unvested long-term incentive award granted to each Transferred
Employee employed by Rexam or any Rexam Entity to vest and be paid in
accordance with the terms that are no less favorable than those contemplated
by Schedule 2 to the Co-operation Agreement. Seller shall cause each
outstanding and unvested long-term incentive award granted to each Transferred
Employee employed by Seller or any Seller Entity, other than the Rexam or the
Rexam Entities, to vest in accordance with the provisions of such award on or
immediately prior to the Closing Date and, to the extent any such outstanding
long-term incentive award is not vested and paid to a Transferred Employee on
or immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall grant a cash retention
award to such Transferred Employee, in each case in accordance with the Ball
Packaging Europe Special Incentive Program. In addition, to the extent
permitted by the applicable Employee Benefit Plan, Collective Bargaining
Agreement, National Collective Bargaining Agreement or applicable Law, Seller
shall pay or cause to be paid to each Transferred Employee in cash on or as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date a pro rata portion of
the 2016 short-term incentive award granted to such Transferred Employee. The
pro rata 2016 short-term incentive award amount shall be determined on the
basis of the number of days elapsed in 2016 through the Closing Date and
performance equal to actual performance through the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be solely
responsible for the payment of any cash retention awards granted to
Transferred Employees on or prior to the Closing that are payable to the
Transferred Employees after the Closing Date in connection with the
satisfaction of a continued service requirement and any short term incentive
payments that are due to be paid in the normal course after the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such retention awards and short term

 



      
 

 



 

incentive awards shall be listed on _Schedule 5.1(c)_ and included in Net
Debt for purposes of _Section 1.6_.

 



 

(d) _Severance Liabilities_. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be solely
responsible for any severance, change in control, accrued paid time off,
redundancy, termination indemnitees or similar termination payments or
benefits that may become payable (i) to any Transferred Employee terminated by
Purchaser or its Affiliates on or following the Closing Date and (ii) to any
Business Employee (A) who does not receive an offer of employment as required
pursuant to _Sections 5.1(a)_ and _Section 5.1(b)_ and who resigns as of the
Closing Date under circumstances entitling the Business Employee to any such
payments and benefits, or (B) who asserts a statutory right to object to the
transfer of employment contemplated by _Section 5.1(a)(ii)_ where Purchaser
and its Affiliates fail to comply with the Transfer Regulations or otherwise
do not honor _Section 5.1(a)_ or _Section 5.1(b)_ and who is entitled to
severance on the termination of his or her employment following such
objection, and Purchaser shall indemnify Seller, Rexam and any of their
respective Affiliates from any and all Liabilities for such payments and
benefits. To the extent that Seller, Rexam or any of their respective
Affiliates become liable for, or are legally required to make, severance,
change in control, accrued paid time off, redundancy, termination indemnity or
similar termination payments or benefits to any Transferred Employee or
Business Employee described in the foregoing clause (ii), Purchaser shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities) to, reimburse
Seller, Rexam or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, as soon as
practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days of receipt from Seller,
Rexam or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, of appropriate
verification, for all payments, costs and expenses actually incurred in
respect thereof by Seller, Rexam or any of their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, as required by applicable Law or any Contract. Except as provided
above in this _Section 5.1(d)_, Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely
responsible for any severance, change in control, accrued paid time off,
redundancy, termination indemnitees or similar termination payments or
benefits that may become payable to Business Employees dismissed by Seller or
its Affiliates.

 



 

(e) _Service Credit_. To the extent that any Transferred EmployeeÂ’s acquired
rights are not already protected by the Transfer Regulations or other
applicable Law, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, recognize
the prior service of, or recognized with respect to, each Transferred Employee
as if such service had been performed with Purchaser for all purposes,
including eligibility, vesting, service-related level of benefits and benefit
accrual (except for any benefit accruals for U.S. union and non-union hourly
Transferred Employees under the defined benefit Rexam Pension Plan, provided
that such service for benefit accruals purposes under the Rexam Pension Plan
shall be recognized for purposes of early retirement subsidies in accordance
with _Schedule 5.1(h)_ ) under the employee benefit plans and policies
provided by Purchaser to such Transferred Employee following the Closing, to
the same extent such service was recognized by Seller, Rexam or any of their
respective Affiliates, as applicable, immediately prior to the Closing.
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the Purchased
Entities) to, (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise
applicable to Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents under any
plan of Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser that provides health or life
benefits in which the Transferred Employees may be eligible to participate
following the Closing, other than any limitations that were in effect with
respect to a Transferred Employee as of the Closing under the analogous
Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket
maximums incurred by the

 



      
 

 



 

Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in
which they participated immediately prior to the Closing during the portion of
the calendar year prior to the Closing in satisfying any deductibles, co-
payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates in which they are eligible to participate after the Closing in
the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket
maximums were incurred and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a
Transferred Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the
Closing, in each case to the extent such Transferred Employee or eligible
dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an
analogous Employee Benefit Plan prior to the Closing.

 



 

(f) _CBAs_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
immediately following the Closing, Purchaser shall or shall cause its
Affiliates to assume each Collective Bargaining Agreement and any and all
Liabilities thereunder whether arising before, on or after the Closing and
provide to the Transferred Employees who remain in the employment of Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities) and whose
employment is subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement or National
Collective Bargaining Agreement, terms and conditions of employment in
accordance with such Collective Bargaining Agreement or National Collective
Bargaining Agreement until its expiration, modification or termination in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

 



 

(g) _WARN_. Seller and its Affiliates shall comply with all WARN obligations
through the Closing Date with respect to the Business.

 



 

(h) _Pension and Certain Other Post-Employment Benefit Obligations_. The
rights and obligations of Seller and Purchaser or their respective Affiliates
in connection with any pension and post-employment benefit obligations,
including the Defined Benefit Plans, with respect to Transferred Employees and
former employees of the Purchased Entities are described in _Schedule 5.1(h)_.

 



 

(i) _Multiemployer Plan_. Seller and Purchaser intend to comply with the
requirements of Section 4204 of ERISA in order that the Transaction shall not
be deemed a complete or partial withdrawal from the I.A.M. National Pension
Fund (the " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), but only to the extent that there are
unfunded vested benefits in the Multiemployer Plan that would trigger the
occurrence of withdrawal liability, by virtue of a full or partial withdrawal,
as a result of the Transaction. Accordingly, Seller and Purchaser agree as
follows:

 



 

(i) Purchaser will be obligated to make contributions to the Multiemployer
Plan in accordance with any Collective Bargaining Agreement relating thereto
and shall contribute to the Multiemployer Plan with respect to the business
and operations of the Purchased Assets and Purchased Entities on the same
terms as Rexam had an obligation to contribute to the Multiemployer Plan prior
to the Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) Unless and until a variance or exemption is obtained in accordance with
Section 4204(c) of ERISA, Purchaser will provide to the Multiemployer Plan,
for a period of five plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning
after the Closing Date (the " _Contribution Period_ "), a bond issued by a
corporate surety company that is an

 



       
 

 



 

acceptable surety for purposes of Section 412 of ERISA, or an amount held in
escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the
Multiemployer Plan, as applicable, or such other security as may be permitted
under Section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA or regulations thereunder, in an amount
equal to the greater of:

 



 

(A) the average annual contribution required to be made by Rexam to the
Multiemployer Plan with respect to the business and operation of the
Facilities, as applicable, for the three plan years preceding the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs, or

 



 

(B) the annual contribution that Rexam was required to make with respect to
the business and operations of the Facilities under the Multiemployer Plan for
the last plan year before the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs,

 



 

which applicable bond or escrow shall be paid to the Multiemployer Plan if
Purchaser (or its applicable Affiliate) withdraws from the Multiemployer Plan,
or fails to make a contribution to the Multiemployer Plan when due, at any
time during the Contribution Period. Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser
in connection with any application for a variance or exemption under Section
4204(c) of ERISA made by Purchaser to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
or to the Multiemployer Plan and to otherwise comply with the obligations of a
"Seller" under Section 4204 of ERISA. The full costs and expenses relating to
the provision of any bond, letter of credit or escrow required under this
_Section 5.1(h)_, shall be paid by Purchaser.

 



 

(iii) If Purchaser withdraws from the Multiemployer Plan in a complete or
partial withdrawal with respect to the Business and operations of the
Facilities under the Multiemployer Plan during the Contribution Period defined
above, Seller shall be secondarily liable for any withdrawal Liability it
would have incurred to the Multiemployer Plan with respect to the Business and
operations of such Facilities (but for the provisions of Section 4204 of
ERISA) if the withdrawal Liability of Purchaser with respect to the
Multiemployer Plan is not paid. Purchaser agrees to provide Seller reasonable
advance notice of any action or event which could result in the imposition of
withdrawal Liability contemplated by this _Section 5.1(h)_ and in any event
Purchaser shall promptly furnish Seller with a copy of any notice of
withdrawal Liability it may receive with respect to the Multiemployer Plan,
together with all pertinent details. In the event that any such withdrawal
Liability shall be assessed against Purchaser, Purchaser further agrees to
provide Seller advance notice of any intention on the part of Purchaser not to
make full payment of any withdrawal Liability when the same shall become due.

 



 

(iv) Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller and Rexam harmless
against the imposition of any secondary Liability, or any Liability resulting
from the failure of Purchaser to provide a bond, letter of credit, escrow or
other security pursuant to this _Section 5.1(h)_.

 



 

(j) Following the Closing, the employees of Ball Packaging Europe UK Limited
will no longer be able to acquire interests in common stock of Seller pursuant
to the Ball

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan with HMRC reference number A1939 (the
" _ESPP_ "). Subject to applicable Law and the ESPPÂ’s terms, Purchaser shall
cause Ball Packaging Europe UK Limited to continue and administer the ESPP
through the ESPP Trustee until all awards thereunder have become payable.
Seller shall indemnify Purchaser against any Taxes which are incurred by
Purchaser or Ball Packaging Europe UK Limited as a result of the Transaction
in relation to the administration of the ESPP (including the delivery of any
interests in shares to the participants) and the cost of acquisition, in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP, of any Matching Shares (as defined in
the ESPP) awarded prior to the Closing Date provided that Ball Packaging
Europe UK Limited continues to administer the ESPP in accordance with its
terms and this _Section 5.1(j)_.

 



 

(k) The provisions of this _Section 5.1_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties, and no Business Employee or other employee or former employee of
Seller or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein
shall be construed as an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan or any
employee benefit plan of Purchaser for any purpose. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that nothing contained in this Agreement, including in this _Section
5.1_, shall require Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to maintain the
employment of any Business Employee, except as required by applicable Law or
an applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 **TAXES**

 



 

6.1 _Apportionment of Taxes_.

 



 

(a) To the extent permitted or required by applicable Law, the taxable year of
each of the Purchased Entities that includes the Closing Date shall be treated
as closing on (and including) the Closing Date. To the extent such treatment
is not permitted or required by applicable Law, for purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, (i) property Taxes and other
Taxes imposed on a periodic basis allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
based on the number of days of such taxable period included in the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and the number of days of such taxable period included in the Post-
Closing Tax Period and (ii) Taxes (other than Taxes described in clause (i))
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable
period ended as of the end of the day on the Closing Date; _provided_ that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions)
shall be allocated between Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period in proportion to the number of days in each period. Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, Seller shall be liable for Taxes (other than
Transfer Taxes) that are attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and
Purchaser shall be liable for Taxes (other than Excluded Taxes) that are
attributable to any Post-Closing Tax Period. Seller shall also be responsible,
without duplication, for any Excluded Taxes (except for any Excluded Taxes for
which Seller is not required to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to _Section
9.2(c)(vi)_).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Payment by Seller and SellerÂ’s Affiliates of any amount due under this
_Article VI_ shall be made no later than three (3) days prior to the date
such amounts are required to be paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority or
other appropriate party.

 



 

6.2 _Transfer Taxes_. All excise, sales, use, registration, stamp, recording,
documentary, conveyancing, franchise, property, transfer, gains and similar
Taxes, levies, charges and fees, other than any Restructuring Taxes
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the
Transaction, including for the avoidance of doubt any Transfer Taxes incurred
by Seller, Rexam or their respective Affiliates related to any transfer of
assets to or from the Purchased Entities related to the Transaction, shall be
borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. Seller shall cooperate in providing
Purchaser with any appropriate resale exemption certifications and other
similar documentation. For the avoidance of doubt, Transfer Taxes shall not
include any amounts described in the definition of Excluded Taxes or VAT
described in _Section 6.7_.

 



 

6.3 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall timely prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Purchased Entities that are:
(i) required to be filed after the date of this Agreement in respect of Pre-
Closing Tax Periods (other than Straddle Periods subject to _Section 6.3(b)_
below); and (ii) any combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return that
includes Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Purchased Entities),
on the one hand, and any of the Purchased Entities or their respective
subsidiaries, on the other hand. Such Tax Returns described in the foregoing
clause (i) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practices of
the Purchased Entities, unless otherwise required by Law. Any Tax Returns
described in the foregoing clause (i) that are to be prepared, or filed, by
Seller or its Affiliates under this _Section 6.3(a)_ shall be provided to
Purchaser for its review and comments at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
such items being filed, and Seller shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments received from Purchaser at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
due date. Seller shall timely pay any Taxes shown on any such Tax Returns
(other than any Taxes for which Seller is not required to indemnify Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 9.2(c)(vi)_) to the relevant Taxing Authority.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Purchased Entities for any
Straddle Period and, to the extent they are not otherwise required to be filed
or caused to be filed by Seller under _Section 6.3(a)_, Tax Returns for any
Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the past practices of the Purchased Entities, unless otherwise
required by Law. Any Tax Returns that are to be prepared, or filed, by
Purchaser or the Purchased Entities under this _Section 6.3(b)_ shall be
provided to Seller for its review, and comments, together with a statement
setting forth the amount of Tax for which Seller is responsible under _Article
VI_, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to such items being filed, and
Purchaser shall incorporate any reasonable comments received from Seller at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the due date so long as such comments,
if so incorporated, would not materially prejudice Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates. Purchaser shall pay any and all Taxes shown as due on any Tax
Return filed by Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 6.3(b)_. Purchaser shall
be entitled to reimbursement from Seller in respect of any Taxes that are the
responsibility

 



      
 

 



 

of Seller under _Article VI_. Upon payment of any such Tax, Purchaser shall
present a statement to Seller setting forth the amount of reimbursement to
which Purchaser is entitled under _Article VI_ together with such supporting
evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to be reimbursed.
Seller shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days after the presentation of such statement.

 



 

(c) If Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve all open issues with respect
to any Tax Return as provided in _Section 6.3(a)_ and _Section 6.3(b)_ above
prior to the due date (taking into account any extension validly obtained),
such Tax Return will be filed as proposed by Seller (in the case of a Tax
Return described in _Section 6.3(a)_) or Purchaser (in the case of a Tax
Return described in _Section 6.3(b)_), and such open issues shall be referred
to the Tax Advisor promptly after the filing due date. The Tax Advisor shall
resolve such open issues, and any reimbursement payment or indemnification
payment by either Seller or Purchaser under this _Article VI_ shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect the resolution of the Tax Advisor.

 



 

6.4 _Tax Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance (including access to Books and Records with the assistance of
employees) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the
making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any
Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax, provided, however, that in the case of Tax
Returns of either Party or their Affiliates (or of a consolidated, combined,
unitary or Tax group any of them), the Party providing the Tax Return may, in
lieu of delivering the Tax Return, deliver to the other Party pro-forma
statements setting forth in sufficient detail the relevant information.

 



 

(b) Without limiting _Section 6.4(a)_, within the time limits permitted by
applicable Laws, Seller shall be entitled to request that a Purchased Entity
and an appropriate Affiliate of Seller (other than a Purchased Entity) make
(or join in making, as applicable) a Degrouping Election. If Seller exercises
its right under this _Section 6.4(b)_, Purchaser shall cause the relevant
Purchased Entity to enter into the Degrouping Election (including filing such
Degrouping Election with the relevant Taxing Authority, whether separately or
together with that Purchased EntityÂ’s relevant Tax Return) and provide an
executed copy of such Degrouping Election to Seller within five (5) Business
Days of receipt of the draft form of the Degrouping Election from Seller.

 



 

6.5 _Refunds or Credits; Amended Returns_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall promptly pay to Seller any refunds or credits of Taxes
received by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (i) relating to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period of the Purchased Assets or (ii) that are refunds or credits of
Taxes previously paid by Seller. Purchaser shall be entitled to all other
refunds and credits of Taxes attributable to the Purchased Assets.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall not (i) amend any Tax Return relating to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or (ii) make any Tax election that would affect in any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, in each case without the consent of Seller, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned,

 



      
 

 



 

or delayed; provided that, Purchaser shall be entitled to amend any Tax Return
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period if (x) Purchaser requests and receives
written confirmation from Seller that Seller has determined that such
amendment would not materially prejudice Seller or (y) Purchaser obtains a Tax
Opinion to the effect that (A) such amendment would correct an error, omission
or factual discrepancy found in such Tax Return, (B) there is no reasonable
basis for the original position claimed on such Tax Return, and (C) the
failure to so amend such Tax Return could subject Purchaser to penalties or
other additional costs or expenses. In the case Purchaser amends any Tax
Return relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to the proviso in the
previous sentence, Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly in writing of such
amendment and provide to Seller a copy of any Tax Opinion obtained in
connection with such amendment. Purchaser shall prepare and file any amended
return as may be reasonably requested by Seller, provided (1) that Seller
shall bear any and all costs of preparing, filing and pursuing such return,
and (2) that Purchaser shall not be required to take any action that Purchaser
determines could materially prejudice Purchaser or its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Purchased Entities). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser agrees to take the necessary administrative action, at SellerÂ’s
expense, including but not limited to amending the relevant Tax Return of Ball
Packaging Europe UK Ltd., as reasonably directed by Seller in order to allow
final resolution of the 2006 UK Tax Dispute; _provided_ that, upon PurchaserÂ’s
request and at SellerÂ’s cost, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a Tax Opinion
or such other documents or information reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser
(upon which Purchaser and its Affiliates may rely) that supports the
administrative action so requested and or the position or treatment set forth
on such amended Tax return or addresses other matters as reasonably requested
by Purchaser.

 



 

6.6 _Contests_. Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an
assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which Seller, and
not Purchaser, is liable under this Agreement, Purchaser shall upon receipt of
such assertion, promptly, but in no event more than twenty (20) Business Days
from such receipt, inform Seller in writing and Seller shall have the right to
control any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle
any such claim, assessment or dispute to the extent such proceedings or
determinations affect the amount of Taxes for which Seller may be liable under
this Agreement and does not materially affect the amount for which Purchaser
is liable under this Agreement. Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a claim,
makes an assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which
Purchaser, and not Seller, is liable under this Agreement, Purchaser shall
have the right to control any resulting proceedings and to determine whether
and when to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute, except to the extent
such proceedings affect the amount of Taxes for which Seller is liable under
this Agreement. Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an
assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which both Seller and
Purchaser may be liable, (i) each such Party may participate in any resulting
proceedings, (ii) the proceedings shall be controlled by the Party that would
bear the burden of the greater portion of the sum of the adjustment and any
corresponding adjustments that may reasonably be anticipated for future
taxable periods and (iii) neither Party shall settle the proceedings without
the consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, provided however, that when an amount in dispute is
$250,000 or less, the Party that would bear the burden of the greater portion
of the sum of the adjustment and any corresponding adjustments that may
reasonably be anticipated for future taxable periods may settle any such
proceeding on behalf of both Parties without the consent of the other Party if
the Party bearing the greater burden obtains a Tax Opinion, on which both
Parties may rely, to the effect that the settlement is

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable based on the facts and circumstances of the issue which is the
basis of such proceeding.

 



 

6.7 _VAT_. The Purchase Price shall be exclusive of VAT and if VAT is properly
charged or chargeable upon Seller or any of its Affiliates, Purchaser shall
pay Seller (in addition to the Purchase Price) the amount of such VAT within
five (5) Business Days of receipt of a VAT invoice in compliance with local
Laws.

 



 

6.8 _Earnings and Profits_. _Schedule 2.18_ contains a list of the Purchased
Entities that (i) are treated as "controlled foreign corporations" or (ii) are
disregarded entities and direct subsidiaries of Purchased Entities treated as
"controlled foreign corporations" immediately prior to the Closing for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (the Purchased Entities described in clauses (i)
and (ii), and designated as such in _Schedule 2.18_ , " _Purchased CFCs_ ").
Except with the express written consent of Seller, none of Purchaser nor its
Affiliates shall take, or cause or permit the Purchased CFCs to take, any
action outside the ordinary course of business of Purchaser or any Purchased
CFCs on or after the Closing Date (including any restructuring or Tax election
with respect to such Purchased Entities, and other than any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Restructuring) or that was
subject to a binding contract or other commitment entered into prior to the
Closing or that is a recurring obligation) that would increase or decrease the
earnings and profits of Seller or its Affiliates by a material amount for any
Tax period that includes the Closing Date, as calculated for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes.

all of the other representations and warranties of Seller contained in this
Agreement (disregarding all qualifications and exceptions contained therein

Confirmation Date), except in either case where any failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not result in a
Business Material Adverse Effect, (iii) (1) the covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement (other than _Section 4.18(d)_) to be complied
with by Seller on or before the Closing shall have been complied with in all
material respects and (2) no Seller Intentional Breach shall have occurred and
be continuing, in each case as of the Confirmation Date (or if clause (2) of
_Section 7.1_ applies, the Closing Date), and (iv) Purchaser shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Seller by an officer of Seller to
the effect that the conditions set forth in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) have been satisfied.

 



 

(b) (i) The FTC shall have accepted for public comment an agreement containing

this Agreement) and shall have approved the terms of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and Purchaser as the purchaser of the Purchased Assets

(c) No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any Law or Governmental Order (whether temporary,

the Transaction illegal or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
Transaction.

respect to the French and Spanish Entities and Dutch Entities or as otherwise
expressly noted therein), the Restructuring shall have been completed in all

made as of the Confirmation Date), except in either case where any failure of

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 **TERMINATION**

 



 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Purchaser;

 



 

(b) upon written notice, by Seller or Purchaser to the other Parties, in the
event that any Governmental Order or Law restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Transaction shall have
become final and non-appealable;

 



 

(c) upon written notice, by Seller or Purchaser to the other Parties in the
event that (i) after accepting an agreement containing a consent order for
public comment, the FTC notifies Seller that Purchaser is not an acceptable
purchaser of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, (ii) Seller
receives final written notification from the EC that it will not approve
Purchaser as the purchaser of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, or
that it will not clear the Transaction, or (iii) Seller receives written
notification from CADE that the approval of Purchaser as the purchaser of the
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities shall not be granted; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(c)_ shall not be available to: (x) Seller if Seller is in material breach
of its obligations pursuant to _Section 4.5_ and such breach shall have been
the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the applicable event set forth in the
foregoing clauses (i) **Â—** (iii); or (y) Purchaser if Purchaser is in
material breach of its obligations pursuant to _Section 4.5_ and such breach
shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the applicable event
set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) **Â—** (iii);

 



 

(d) by either Seller or Purchaser, upon written notice to the non-terminating
Parties by the terminating Party, if the Closing shall not have occurred by
September 5, 2016 (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) to
the extent the "Long Stop Date" (as defined in the Rule 2.7 Announcement) is
extended as permitted under the Rule 2.7 Announcement or the Co-operation
Agreement, the End Date shall be extended until the equivalent date of such
extension (it being understood and agreed that in no event shall the End Date
be later than October 31, 2016 without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (ii) the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1(d)_ shall not be available to: (x) Seller
if SellerÂ’s failure to perform any material covenant or obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date; or (y) Purchaser if
PurchaserÂ’s failure to perform any material covenant or obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

 



 

(e) by Purchaser, if there has been a material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller (either in respect of itself or
Rexam) such that the condition to Closing set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ would
not be satisfied as of such time and such

 



      
 

 



 

breach, if curable, has not been cured by the earlier of (i) the date that is
thirty (30) days after Purchaser has notified Seller in writing of such breach
or (ii) the End Date (as such date may be extended pursuant to _Section
8.1(d))_;

 



 

(f) by Seller, if there has been a material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of Purchaser such that the condition to
Closing set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ would not be satisfied as of such time
and such breach, if curable, has not been cured by the earlier of (i) the date
that is thirty (30) days after Seller has notified Purchaser in writing of
such breach or (ii) the End Date (as such date may be extended pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)_);

 



 

(g) by Seller, if Purchaser provides the notice pursuant to _Section 4.2_ by
the applicable time required therein; or

 



 

(h) immediately, without action of any Party, if the Rexam Transaction is
terminated, withdrawn or lapses.

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability on the part of any Party except: (i) as set forth
in _Section 4.3(b)_, _Section 4.3(c)_, _Section 4.18(e)_, this _Section
8.2_ and _Article XI_; and (ii) that nothing herein shall relieve Seller or
Purchaser from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement occurring
prior to such termination, in which case the other non-breaching Party shall
be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or equity. For
purposes of this _Section 8.2_, "willful breach" or "willfully breached"
shall mean a deliberate act or a deliberate failure to act by a Party, which
act or failure to act (A) constitutes, in and of itself, a material breach of
this Agreement and (B) such Party knew would prevent or materially delay, or
knew the likely effect of which material breach was to prevent or materially
delay, the Closing or the Financing from occurring. If this Agreement is
terminated and the Transaction is abandoned pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ or
_Section 8.1(h)_ (if the Rexam Transaction is terminated, withdrawn or lapses
as a result of Seller invoking a condition relating to Anti-trust Material
Adverse Effect or a breach by Seller of the Co-operation Agreement or of any
undertaking of Seller set forth in the Rule 2.7 Announcement), then, without
prejudice to or limitation of any other rights or remedies which may be
available to Purchaser or its Affiliates, concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement by Seller or within two (2) Business Days following the
termination of this Agreement by Purchaser, Seller shall promptly reimburse
Purchaser all documented costs, fees and expenses incident to the Financing
(including all reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel, accountants and
other advisors and all rating agency fees, printing expenses, escrow agent
fees and the amount of any premium or penalty paid or broken funding costs
incurred in connection with the release and return of escrowed funds to bond
holders or lenders); _provided_ that in no event shall the payment to be made
by Seller pursuant to this sentence exceed $100 million; _provided_ , that
Seller shall not be required to reimburse Purchaser if the Rexam Transaction
is terminated, withdrawn or lapses because the FTC, the EC or CADE fails to
approve Purchaser as a suitable purchaser of the Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities or fails to approve the terms of this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 **INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL**

 



 

9.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. The
representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of fifteen (15) months
following the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ that (1) the
representations and warranties of (A) Seller contained in _Sections 2.1_ ,
_2.2_ , _2.3(a)_ and _2.19_ (collectively, the " _Seller Fundamental
Representations_ ") and (B) Purchaser contained in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.7_ and
_3.8_ (collectively, the " _Purchaser Fundamental Representations_ ") shall
survive indefinitely, (2) the representations and warranties of Seller
contained in _Section 2.18_ (Taxes) shall survive the Closing until ninety
(90) days after the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations
(including any extensions thereof, whether automatic or permissive), and (3)
any representation or warranty or covenant or agreement that would otherwise
terminate shall continue to survive, with respect to such claim only, if a
Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice (as applicable) shall have been timely given
in good faith based on facts reasonably expected to establish a valid claim
under this _Article IX_ on or prior to such termination date, until the
related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as
provided in this _Article IX_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the covenants
and agreements of Seller and Purchaser with respect to indemnification for
Taxes shall survive the Closing Date until ninety (90) days following the
expiration of the applicable statutory periods of limitations for the
assessment and collection of Tax (or, if written notice of a good faith claim
for indemnification shall have been duly given prior to such time, until the
final resolution of such claim). The other covenants and agreements of Seller
and Purchaser that contemplate actions to be taken or not taken, in respect of
Seller, Purchaser and Rexam, or obligations in effect after the Closing, shall
survive in accordance with their terms. The covenants and agreements of Seller
or Purchaser that contemplate actions to be taken or not taken prior to the
Closing shall terminate as of twelve (12) months following the Closing.

 



 

9.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_, from and after the
Closing, Seller shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates and its and their
officers, directors, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") in respect of, and hold them harmless from and
against, (i) any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by a Purchaser
Indemnitee by reason of or resulting from (A) any breach of any representation
or warranty of Seller (either in respect of itself or Rexam) in this Agreement
at and as of the Closing as though made at and as of such time (or, if made as
of a specific date, at and as of such date) (in each case, without giving
effect to any limitations or qualifications as to "materiality" (including the
word "material"), Business Material Adverse Effect or Adverse Effect set forth
therein) or (B) nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of Seller (either in respect of itself or Rexam)
contained in this Agreement, (ii) the Excluded Assets and the Excluded
Liabilities, (iii) subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.5_,
Seller-Indemnified On-Site Environmental Liabilities, (iv) Losses or Taxes, as
applicable, directly resulting from actions taken by Seller, Rexam or any of
their respective Affiliates in order to effect the Restructuring to the extent

arise prior to, on or after the Closing Date, (v) any and all Taxes that are
the responsibility

 



      
 

 



 

of Seller under _Article VI_, and (vi) any and all Liabilities arising out of
or relating to the Purchased Entity Guarantees; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(1) Seller shall have no liability under _Section 9.2(a)(i)(A)_ as a result
of the breach of or inaccuracy in any such representation or warranty to the
extent that Purchaser had actual knowledge that such representation or
warranty was untrue or incorrect prior to the date of this Agreement, (2) with
respect to indemnification by Seller for any claim pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(i)(A)_ (other than any Seller Fundamental Representation), (X) no claim
shall be deemed to have occurred unless the amount of Losses with respect
thereto exceeds $100,000, (Y) Seller shall not be liable unless the aggregate
amount of Losses for all such claims exceeds an amount equal to 0.5% of the
Purchase Price and then only to the extent of such excess and (Z) SellerÂ’s
maximum liability for all such claims shall not exceed an amount equal to 1%
of the Purchase Price in the aggregate, and (3) in no event shall the
aggregate amount of Losses for which Seller is obligated to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnitees under this _Article IX_ (other than _Section
9.2(a)(ii) _and _Section 9.2(a)(v)_) exceed an amount equal to 50% of the
Purchase Price; _provided_ , _further_ , that the limitations set forth in
subsections (1) and (2) in this _Section 9.2(a)_ shall not apply to any Loss
to the extent such Loss results from SellerÂ’s, RexamÂ’s or their respective
AffiliatesÂ’ fraud, and any indemnifiable amounts arising from such Loss shall
not be counted against the limits set forth in subsection (2).

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_, from and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and its and their
officers, directors, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnitees_ ") in respect of, and hold them harmless from and
against, (i) any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by a Seller
Indemnitee by reason of or resulting from (A) any breach of any representation
or warranty of Purchaser in this Agreement at and as of the Closing as though
made at and as of such time (or, if made as of a specific date, at and as of
such date) (in each case, without giving effect to any limitations or
qualifications as to "materiality" (including the word "material") or material
adverse effect set forth therein) or (B) nonfulfillment of or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement, (ii) the Assumed Liabilities, including Seller-Indemnified On-Site
Environmental Liabilities (except with respect to the latter, Purchaser shall
have no obligation to indemnify Seller to the extent Purchaser Indemnitees
have a right of indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_, taking into
account any limitations on such right set forth in this _Article IX_), (iii)
the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or the Business after the
Closing Date, (iv) all Taxes that are the responsibility of Purchaser under
_Article VI_ and (v) any and all Liabilities arising out of or relating to
the Seller Guarantees; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall have no
liability under this _Section 9.2_ as a result of the breach of or inaccuracy
in any such representation or warranty to the extent that Seller had actual
knowledge that such representation or warranty was untrue or incorrect prior
to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The indemnity obligations of the Parties under this _Article IX_ (other
than, except as specifically provided in _Section 9.2(c)(vi)_, any indemnity
obligations with respect to Taxes that are the responsibility of Seller under
_Article VI_) shall be subject to, and further limited by, the provisions as
set forth in this _Section 9.2(c)_.

 



 

(i) No indemnity shall be payable under this _Article IX_ with respect to
Losses for which the Indemnified Party has not provided the Indemnifying Party
a Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice, as applicable, with respect to such claim,
setting forth in

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable detail the specific facts and circumstances pertaining thereto as
soon as practical following the time at which the Indemnified Party discovered
or reasonably should have discovered such claim. The failure to give such
written notice as soon as practical shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party has been materially prejudiced by reason of
such failure.

 



 

(ii) Each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take
all actions as may be reasonably required or necessary to mitigate, to the
extent practicable, Losses in connection with claims for which a Purchaser
Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, seeks indemnification
under this _Article IX_.

 



 

(iii) Seller shall have no indemnity obligations under this _Article IX_ for
Losses to the extent such Losses are reflected as a Liability of the Business
included in the Audited Financial Statements or the Pro Forma Financial
Statements or are otherwise taken into account for purposes of _Section 1.6_.

 



 

(iv) No Indemnifying Party shall have any indemnity obligations for special or
punitive damages to the extent awarded against an Indemnified Party in
connection with a Third Party Claim.

 



 

(v) Except for fraud or as provided in _Section 1.7_, _Section 4.4_,
_Section 4.9(d)_, _Section 4.10(d)_, _Section 4.11_, _Section 4.15_,
_Section 4.16_, _Section 4.18(e)_, _Section 5.1_, _Article VI_, _Section
8.2_ and _Section 11.10_, from and after the Closing, the rights and remedies
set forth in this _Article IX_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive rights
and remedies of the Parties with respect to this Agreement, the events giving
rise to this Agreement and the Transaction. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, no Party shall have any rights to set-off indemnifiable Losses
pursuant to this _Article IX_ against other obligations owed to any other
Party. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser, for itself and its
Affiliates, does hereby irrevocably release, hold harmless and forever
discharge Seller and its Affiliates from any and all Liabilities arising
pursuant to Environmental Law or with respect to Hazardous Materials resulting
from or arising out of or in connection with the Purchased Assets except for
fraud or the remedies expressly set forth in this Agreement. In furtherance
of, but subject to, the foregoing, Purchaser, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates, hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights and benefits with
respect to such Liabilities that it now has, or in the future may have
conferred upon it by virtue of any Law or common law principle, in each case,
which provides that a general release does not extend to claims which a party
does not know or suspect to exist in its favor at the time of executing the
release, if knowledge of such claims would have materially affected such
partyÂ’s settlement with the obligor. In connection with the foregoing,
Purchaser hereby acknowledges that it is aware that factual matters now
unknown to it and Seller or any of their respective Affiliates may have given,
or hereafter may give, rise to Liabilities arising under Environmental Laws or
with respect to Hazardous Materials, and Purchaser further agrees that the
release set forth in this _Section 9.2(c)(v)_ has been negotiated and agreed
upon in light of that awareness, and Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates,
nevertheless hereby intends

 



      
 

 



 

irrevocably to release, hold harmless and forever discharge Seller and its
Affiliates from all such Liabilities except for fraud or the remedies
expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(vi) No indemnity shall be payable under this _Article IX_ with respect to
Taxes (A) that have been paid by Seller or its Affiliates to the appropriate
Taxing Authority prior to the Closing Date, (B) that result from any
transactions undertaken on the Closing Date after the Closing by Purchaser or
any of PurchaserÂ’s Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Purchased
Entities) outside the ordinary course of business for such entities and not
already contemplated by this Agreement (including the Restructuring), (C) that
would not have resulted but for any non-compliance of Purchaser with any of
its obligations under this Agreement, (D) to the extent such Taxes are
actually paid by, or obtained from, third parties, (E) that result from any
change enacted after the Closing Date in the applicable Tax rates with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (F) for which a Tax Benefit (not otherwise
reflected in the Audited Financial Statements or taken into account in
determining the Purchase Price) of a Purchased Entity is carried over from a
Pre-Closing Tax Period to a Post-Closing Tax Period and is available to set
off or use against any liability for such Taxes of the same type and character
for which such Tax Benefit relates, or (G) that are treated as arising to
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than any Purchased Entities) as a
result of a Degrouping Election pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_ or would have
been so treated but for a failure by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser
(including any Purchased Entity) to enter into a Degrouping Election upon a
request by Seller pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_.

 



 

9.3 _Indemnity Procedures_. All claims for indemnification by any Indemnified
Party under _Section 9.2_ (other than claims for indemnification with respect
to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by _Article VI_) shall be
asserted and resolved as set forth in this _Section 9.3_.

 



 

(a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified Party
might seek indemnity under _Section 9.2_ is asserted against or sought to be
collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than Seller, Purchaser
or any Affiliate of Seller or of Purchaser (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying
Party. With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to control the defense of such Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s sole cost and expense, including the right to settle such
Third Party Claim, if the Indemnifying Party gives notice of its intention to
do so to the Indemnified Party within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of
notice from the Indemnified Party of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the proposed settlement provides for relief other than the
payment of money damages, the Indemnifying Party may settle such Third Party
Claim only with the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if there exists a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate
in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, upon consultation with
legal counsel, for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
retain its own counsel in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines counsel is required, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim,
including in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third
Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any Person (other than the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party or any of its Affiliates). The Indemnified Party may, at
its sole cost and expense, retain separate counsel to participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim. The Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to retain, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, its own counsel to control or participate in any Third
Party Claim if the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that the
Indemnifying Party fails to defend appropriately such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend such Third Party Claim or
fails to notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as
provided in _Section 9.3(a)_, the Indemnified Party may pay, compromise or
defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification under _Section 9.2_
for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third
Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any proposed settlement provides
for relief other than the payment of money damages, the Indemnified Party may
settle such Third Party Claim only with the consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim under _Section
9.2_ against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver an Indemnity Notice to the
Indemnifying Party. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been materially
prejudiced by reason of such failure.

 



 

(d) In the event of any claim for indemnity under _Section 9.2_, the
Indemnified Party agrees to give the Indemnifying Party and its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives reasonable access to the Books and Records
will use reasonable efforts to provide reasonable access to employees of the
Business and the Purchased Entities in connection with the matters for which
indemnification is sought, to the extent the Indemnifying Party reasonably
deems necessary in connection with its rights and obligations under this
_Article IX_.

 



 

9.4 _Tax Effect_.

 



 

(a) The amount of any Loss or Taxes for which indemnification is provided
under this _Article IX_ shall be reduced to take account of any net Tax
Benefit actually realized in the year of the loss or in the succeeding three
(3) taxable years by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or
payment of any such Loss.

 



 

(b) Any amounts paid pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be considered an
adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent allowed under applicable Law.
Purchaser and Seller, and each of their respective Affiliates, shall prepare
and file, and cause their Affiliates to prepare and file, Tax Returns (and if

the foregoing sentence. The indemnities expressed to be given in favor of (i)

United Kingdom corporation tax, so far as possible be treated as indemnities
in favor of (i) Purchaser, and (ii) Seller, only and payments in respect of

9.5 _Additional Provisions Related to Indemnification for Seller-Indemnified
On-Site Environmental Liabilities and Breach of Section 2.15_.

 



 

(a) _Application_. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of _Sections
9.2(c)_ and _9.3_ of this Agreement shall also apply to claims for
indemnification related to Seller-Indemnified On-Site Environmental
Liabilities. To the extent that a Purchaser Indemnitee makes a claim pursuant
to _Section 9.2(a)(i)(A)_ for breach of the representations set forth in
_Section 2.15_, the provisions of this _Section 9.5_ (other than _Sections
9.5(b)_ and _9.5(c)_ ) shall be applicable to such claim.

 



 

(b) _Baskets and Caps_. With respect to indemnification by Seller for any
claim pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, (i) no claim shall be deemed to have
occurred unless the amount of Losses with respect thereto exceeds $100,000 and
(ii) Seller shall not be liable unless the aggregate amount of Losses for all
such claims exceeds an amount equal to 1% of the Purchase Price (the "
_Aggregate Environmental Basket_ ") and then only to the extent of the amount
of Losses in excess of such aggregate basket. For purposes of clarification,
matters that are not subject to indemnification because the Losses incurred
with respect to such matters do not exceed $100,000 shall not be counted
towards the Aggregate Environmental Basket. SellerÂ’s maximum liability for all
claims arising pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_ shall not exceed an amount
equal to 5% of the Purchase Price in the aggregate.

 



 

(c) _Survival_. The right of Purchaser Indemnitees to make a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ shall survive the Closing
for a period of thirty-six (36) months following the Closing Date ("
_Environmental Indemnity Survival Date_ "). A claim for indemnification
pursuant to said section will continue to survive only if a Claim Notice or
Indemnity Notice (as applicable) shall have been timely given in good faith
based on facts reasonably expected to establish a valid claim under this
_Article IX_ or prior to the Environmental Indemnity Survival Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Aggregate Environmental Basket is not
exceeded by the Environmental Indemnity Survival Date, Seller shall have no
indemnification obligations for any claims with respect to Seller-Indemnified
On-Site Environmental Liabilities.

 



 

(d) _Other Limitations on Indemnification_. The following principles, terms
and limitations shall apply to any claims for indemnification with respect to
Seller-Indemnified On-Site Environmental Liabilities or related claims for
breach of the representations set forth in _Section 2.15_:

 



 

(i) If the cost of investigation or remediation of actual or alleged
contamination of the Business Real Properties, or the cost of correcting a
non-compliance with Environmental Law that is subject to indemnity, is
increased due to the actions or omissions by or on behalf of any Person other
than Seller, its Affiliates, their respective Representatives or any Person
for which or whom Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is
responsible, Seller shall not be responsible to the extent of any such
increase in costs incurred.

 



 

(ii) Seller shall only be obligated to indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees for
fines or penalties arising out of actual or alleged noncompliance with
Environmental Laws accruing during the period prior to the Closing Date or for
expenditures made or

 



      
 

 



 

actions taken by Purchaser Indemnitees to achieve compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws, to the extent the operations at the Business Real Property
were not in compliance on the Closing Date, and shall in no event be liable
(A) for any Losses arising out of any expenditures made or actions taken by
any Purchaser Indemnitee to maintain compliance with applicable Environmental
Laws based on circumstances arising after the Closing Date; (B) for
expenditures that are not commercially reasonable, taking into account the
obligation to come into compliance with applicable Environmental Law or,
subject to the express written consent of Seller at SellerÂ’s sole discretion,
improve the Business Real Property in a manner that goes beyond what is
required to bring said assets into compliance with applicable Environmental
Law for the purpose of providing an economic benefit to a Purchaser
Indemnitee; or (C) for operating costs relating to the ongoing operation of
the Business at the Business Real Property, provided, for purposes of
clarification, that this limitation does not apply to the costs incurred to
correct the noncompliance that is the subject to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(iii) Seller shall not be responsible for any Losses, including costs of
investigation and remediation of properties impacted by Hazardous Materials,
to the extent such Losses are incurred due to (A) actions that are not
required by applicable Environmental Law or any demand, claim, action, suit,
directive or order of a Governmental Authority or any third party, unless such
actions are undertaken with the express written consent of Seller at SellerÂ’s
sole discretion; (B) any change in Environmental Laws or written
interpretation thereof by the applicable Governmental Authority, in either
case, after the Closing Date; (C) the closure of any Business Real Property
after the Closing Date; (D) any change in the use of the Business Real
Property after the Closing Date that would trigger investigation or
remediation obligations or would result in the imposition of a more stringent
remediation standard; or (E) any investigation or remediation that is
conducted to achieve compliance in excess of the least stringent applicable
remediation standard, consistent with the manufacturing operations at the
Business Real Property in effect as of the Closing Date. Seller shall not be
liable for any operating costs associated with post-remedial monitoring
(excluding such monitoring that is implemented to verify that a remedial
activity has achieved compliance with applicable remediation standards, prior
to entering into a long-term post-remedial phase) and operations and
maintenance after completion of a remediation of any environmental media. To
the extent necessary to implement the foregoing, Purchaser Indemnitees shall
agree to appropriate deed restrictions and engineering controls that prohibit
uses of the property that are inconsistent with the least stringent
remediation standard and limit exposure to contaminants that are allowed to
remain in place.

 



 

(iv) Seller shall not be responsible for costs for investigation, remediation,
corrective actions or other Losses arising out of or related to any
investigation of soil or groundwater that any Purchaser Indemnitee voluntarily
initiates, performs or causes to be performed by any Person or Governmental
Authority, if such investigation is not required by any Environmental Law or
demanded or required by a Governmental Authority, or is not a prudent response
(without consideration of the indemnity provided hereunder) to a demand or
claim by a third party.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) Seller shall not be responsible for any Losses arising as a result of any
matter as to which a Purchaser Indemnitee has initiated contact with a
Governmental Authority if the principal, but not necessarily exclusive, reason
for the contact is to identify, enhance or accelerate a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(vi) If any Purchaser or Affiliate of Purchaser sells any Business Real
Property and the right of Purchaser Indemnitees to indemnification with
respect to On-Site Environmental Liabilities has not terminated in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 9.5_ or _Section 9.2(a)(i)(A)_ for breach of
the representations set forth in _Section 2.15_, Purchaser shall or shall
cause said Affiliate to include _Section 9.5(d)(iii)_ or equivalent language
in the purchase and sale agreement and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller Indemnitees for any Losses incurred by Seller Indemnitees due
to the failure to comply with this obligation.

 



 

(vii) Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees for any
costs and expenses associated with Purchaser IndemniteesÂ’ oversight of
SellerÂ’s performance of its defense and indemnity obligations, and Seller
shall not be obligated to indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees for any internal
costs attributed to the time spent on an indemnified matter by any of
Purchaser Indemnitees.

 



 

(e) _Control of Investigation or Remediation_.

 



 

(i) With respect to any matter subject to indemnification by Seller that
relates to the investigation or remediation of any Release of Hazardous
Materials at or from the Business Real Property, Seller shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to take the lead and implement any such investigation
or remediation. Seller shall promptly provide copies to Purchaser of all
notices, correspondence, draft reports, submissions, work plans, and final
reports and shall give Purchaser a reasonable opportunity (at PurchaserÂ’s own
expense) to comment on any submissions Seller intends to deliver or submit to
the appropriate regulatory body prior to said submission. Purchaser may, at
its own expense, hire its own consultants, attorneys or other professionals to
monitor the investigation or remediation, including any field work undertaken
by Seller, and Seller shall provide Purchaser with the results of all such
field work. Notwithstanding the above, Purchaser shall not take any actions
that shall unreasonably interfere with SellerÂ’s performance of the
investigation, remediation and/or containment. Seller shall undertake any such
work required herein in a manner designed to minimize any disruption with the
conduct of operations at the property. Purchaser shall allow Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives reasonable access upon
reasonable advance notice to the Business Real Property to conduct any of the
work contemplated herein and shall fully cooperate with Seller in the
performance of the investigation, remediation or containment, including, but
not limited to, providing Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives with reasonable access to employees and documents as
necessary.

 



 

(ii) If Seller declines to undertake the performance of an investigation and
remediation hereunder, Purchaser shall be entitled to control the
investigation and remediation. Purchaser shall promptly provide copies to
Seller of all notices,

 



      
 

 



 

correspondence, draft reports, submissions, work plans, and final reports and
shall give Seller a reasonable opportunity to comment on any submissions
Purchaser intends to deliver or submit to the appropriate regulatory body
prior to said submission. Seller may, at its own expense, hire its own
consultants, attorneys or other professionals to monitor the investigation and
remediation, including any field work undertaken by Purchaser, and Purchaser
shall provide Seller with the results of all such field work. Notwithstanding
the above, Seller shall not take any actions that shall unreasonably interfere
with PurchaserÂ’s performance of the investigation and remediation. SellerÂ’s
decision to allow Purchaser to undertake investigation and remediation
hereunder shall not limit or affect SellerÂ’s obligation to indemnify Purchaser
for said investigation and remediation as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, including the limits on said obligation as set forth in this
_Section 9.5_.

 



 

9.6 _Insurance Offset_. If the amount of any indemnifiable Losses, at any time
following the payment of an indemnification obligation, is offset or reduced
by the payment of any insurance proceeds, the amount of such insurance
proceeds, less any costs, expenses, premiums or Taxes incurred in connection
therewith (including but not limited to any future increase in insurance
premiums, retroactive premiums, costs associated with any loss of insurance
and replacement thereof or self-insured component of such insurance coverage)
shall be promptly repaid to the Indemnifying Party.

invalid or unenforceable under present or future Laws effective during the
term hereof (including but not limited to anything not permitted under Rule
21.2 of the City Code), such provision shall be fully severable and this
Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision never comprised a part hereof and the remaining

and (b) this _Section 11.5_ and _Sections 11.6_ through _11.9_ and _Section

applicable, and their permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied, shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the
Parties, each as applicable, and such permitted assigns, any legal or
equitable rights hereunder.

 



 

11.6 _Amendment; Waiver_. The failure of any Party to enforce any condition or
part of this Agreement at any time shall not be construed as a waiver of that
condition or part, nor shall it forfeit any rights to future enforcement
thereof. Any waiver hereunder shall be effective only if delivered to the

not be amended except by an agreement in writing signed by each of the
Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that no modification or amendment to this
Agreement shall be made that would adversely affect the rights of the
Financing Sources as set forth in _Sections 11.5_ through _Section 11.9_ or
_Section 11.19_ without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

11.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with and governed by the Laws of the State of New York, without
regard to the conflicts of Laws provisions thereof.

 



 

11.8 _Jurisdiction_. The Parties agree that any Action seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the
United States District Court located in New York, New York in the Borough of
Manhattan so long as such court shall have subject matter jurisdiction over
such Action, or alternatively in the New York State Court located in New York,
New York in the Borough of Manhattan if the aforesaid United States District
Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, and that any cause of action
arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a
transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such court (and of

 



      
 

 



 

the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action in any such
court or that any such Action which is brought in such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action may be served on any
Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of
process on such Party as provided in _Section 11.14_ shall be deemed
effective service of process on such Party.

 



 

11.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH
RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY: (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER; AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 11.9_.

 



 

11.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge that, in view of the
uniqueness of the Business and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of Seller and Purchaser would not have an adequate remedy at
law for money damages in the event that this Agreement has not been performed
in accordance with its terms, and therefore agrees that, in addition to all
other remedies available at law or in equity, the other Parties (on behalf of
itself and the third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement provided in
_Section 11.5_) shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as
applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other (as applicable),
and this right shall include the right of Seller to cause Purchaser and the
Purchaser Financing Parties, as applicable, to draw upon and cause the
Financing to be fully funded if the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and
_7.3_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing) or waived. Each of Seller and Purchaser
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has
an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to

its respective Affiliates to, at the request of the other Party, execute and
deliver to such other Party all such further instruments, assignments,
assurances and other documents as such other Party may reasonably request in
connection with the carrying out of this Agreement and the Transaction.

 



 

11.14 _Notices_. All communications, notices and Consents provided for herein
shall be in writing and be given in person or by means of email, telex,
facsimile or other means of wire transmission (with request for assurance of
receipt in a manner typical with respect to communications of that type), by
overnight courier or by mail, and shall become effective: (a) on delivery if
