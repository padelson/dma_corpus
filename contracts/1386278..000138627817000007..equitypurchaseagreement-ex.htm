This Equity Purchase Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
January 25, 2017, by and among Green Dot Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Buyer"), Empowerment Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Seller"), and UniRush, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Seller (the "Company"). All capitalized terms used in this
Agreement without definition shall have the meanings set forth in Section
8.12.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Company is a Delaware limited liability company subject to the
terms of that certain Limited Liability Company Agreement, dated as of March
6, 2002 (the "LLC Agreement"), pursuant to which all of the Company's limited
liability company interests (the "Membership Interests") have been issued to
Seller;

WHEREAS, the Company (i) provides basic financial services to un-banked and
underbanked individuals in the United States through the prepaid VISA
RushCard, and (ii) sells and distributes paycard processing services to small-
and medium-sized corporations that are seeking a digital solution to the
manual payroll check-writing process; and

WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell,
assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, all of the Membership
Interests, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

WHEREAS, on the date hereof and in connection with Buyer's purchase of the
Membership Interests, Russell Simmons, one of the founders of the Company, is
entering into that certain Endorsement and License Agreement with the Company
(the "Endorsement and License Agreement") and that certain Founders
Restrictive Covenant Agreement with Buyer.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements,
covenants, representations and warranties hereafter set forth, and intending
to be legally bound, Buyer, the Company and Seller hereby agree as follows:

Article I.PURCHASE AND SALE OF EQUITY

Section 1.01 Purchase and Sale of Equity. At the Closing, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller shall sell, convey,
transfer, assign and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and acquire
from Seller, all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to all of the
Membership Interests of the Company, free and clear of all Liens (other than
any Liens permitted by Buyer and any restrictions on transfer under federal
and state securities Laws).

Section 1.02 Purchase Price.

(a) Purchase Price. In consideration for the Membership Interests, Buyer shall
pay the Adjusted Purchase Price to Seller in accordance with Section 1.03(b)
and Section 1.05 and the Earn-Out Payments in accordance with Section 1.07
(collectively, the "Purchase Price").



1002446029v14

* * *





(b) Tax Treatment; Allocation of Purchase Price. For U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income Tax purposes, each of Buyer, the Company and
Seller intends, and shall treat and report (and, to the extent applicable,
cause its Affiliates to treat and report), the transfer of the Membership
Interests to Buyer pursuant to Section 1.01 as the sale by Seller to Buyer of
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries for aggregate consideration
consisting of the Purchase Price (plus other amounts properly treated as
consideration for Tax purposes). The Purchase Price and other amounts properly
treated as consideration for Tax purposes shall be allocated among the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Allocation Schedule") in accordance
with Schedule 1.02(b) and Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), and the related Treasury Regulations (and any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law), which Allocation Schedule Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to Seller within 90 days after the Closing Date. If
Seller notifies Buyer in writing within 20 days of Buyer's delivery to Seller
of the Allocation Schedule that Seller objects to one or more items reflected
in the Allocation Schedule, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute; provided, however, that if Seller and Buyer are unable
to resolve any dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule within 30 days
following Seller's written notification to Buyer of such objection, such
dispute shall be resolved by the Accountants. The fees and expenses of the
Accountants for their review and resolution of any such disputed items shall
be borne by Buyer and Seller in inverse proportion as Buyer and Seller,
respectively, may prevail on the matters resolved by the Accountants under
this Section 1.02(b) (determined based on the final determination of the
disputed items, measured in terms of dollars, relative to the aggregate dollar
amount of the items in dispute), which proportionate allocation shall also be
determined by the Accountants. Within 30 days of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price under any provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall adjust the
Allocation Schedule in a manner consistent with Code Section 1060 and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (as adjusted, the "Adjusted
Allocation Schedule") and this Section 1.02(b) and deliver a copy of the
Adjusted Allocation Schedule to Seller. Any disputes concerning the Adjusted
Allocation Schedule shall be resolved in accordance with the foregoing
procedures set forth in this Section 1.02(b). Seller and Buyer agree to
utilize the Allocation Schedule (or the Adjusted Allocation Schedule, as
applicable) for Tax reporting purposes, including the filing of Form 8594 with
the Internal Revenue Service. Unless otherwise required by a Final
Determination, no party shall file any Tax Return with, or take any position
in any proceedings before, any Governmental Authority that is inconsistent
with the Allocation Schedule (or the Adjusted Allocation Schedule, as
applicable). If any state or federal taxing authority challenges the
Allocation Schedule (or the Adjusted Allocation Schedule, as applicable), the
party receiving notice of the challenge shall promptly provide notice to the
other parties.

Section 1.03 The Closing.

(a) The Closing. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall occur remotely via the electronic exchange of
documents and signatures on (i) such date that is two (2) Business Days after
the conditions set forth in Article V have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time),
provided that if such date occurs prior to February 28, 2017, the Closing
shall instead occur on February 28, 2017 or (ii) such other date as agreed to
in writing by the parties (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing
Date").

(b) Closing Payments. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay or shall cause to be
paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds:





(i) an amount equal to the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price, less the Escrow
Amount, to an account or accounts designated in writing by Seller; provided
that in the event the Financing has not been obtained prior to the Closing,
Buyer may elect to pay up to $75,000,000 of the Estimated Adjusted Purchase
Price in promissory notes; any such notes paid to Seller under this clause (i)
shall be in the form described on Schedule 1.03(b) (the "Purchase Price
Notes"); provided, further, that if any amount of the Estimated Adjusted
Purchase Price is paid in promissory notes, such notes shall first be
allocated to fund the Escrow Amount in accordance with clause (ii) below;

(ii) the Escrow Amount into the Escrow Accounts established pursuant to the
terms and conditions of an escrow agreement by and among Buyer, Seller and
Escrow Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Escrow
Agreement"); provided, that if Buyer elects to deliver promissory notes in
lieu of cash in accordance with clause (i), Buyer shall fund the Escrow Amount
by delivering to the Escrow Agent at least $500,000 in cash and the remainder
of the Escrow Amount in promissory notes in the form described on Schedule
1.03(b) (the "Escrow Notes");

(iii) the amounts set forth in the payoff letters delivered pursuant to
Section 1.03(c)(iv) necessary to discharge such Subject Debt, to the accounts

or will be released as of the Closing, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer;

(v) the executed written resignation as a manager or officer of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, of

as of the Closing.



Section 1.04 Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price. No later than two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer
a statement, certified by the Company's Chief Executive Officer (the
"Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price Statement"), setting forth the estimated
calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price (the "Estimated Adjusted Purchase
Price"), which shall include reasonably itemized detail of the Company's
estimates of (a) each of the Subject Debt, the Transaction Expenses, the
Transaction Bonuses, the Extraordinary Items and Closing Working Capital and
(b) the Working Capital Surplus or Working Capital Deficit, as the case may
be. Buyer may submit any objections in writing to the Company until 5:00 p.m.
Pacific time on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date, and the Company
will cooperate in good faith with Buyer to revise the Estimated Adjusted
Purchase Price Statement to reflect the mutual agreement of the Company and
Buyer, but if they do not agree, then the Company's estimate shall apply.

Section 1.05 Post-Closing Adjustment to Purchase Price.

(a) Final Adjusted Purchase Price Statement. Within 60 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "Final
Adjusted Purchase Price Statement"), certified by Buyer's Chief Executive
Officer, setting forth the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price, which
shall include reasonably itemized detail of Buyer's calculation of (i) each of
the Subject Debt, the Transaction Expenses, the Transaction Bonuses, the
Extraordinary Items and Closing Working Capital and (ii) the Working Capital
Surplus or Working Capital Deficit, as the case may be.

(b) Dispute Notice. Within 30 days after delivery of the Final Adjusted
Purchase Price Statement, Seller may either:

(i) agree in writing with Buyer's calculations, in which case such
calculations will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of this
Agreement; or

(ii) dispute Buyer's calculations by delivering to Buyer a written notice (a
"Dispute Notice") setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for each such
disputed item.

If Seller fails to take either of the foregoing actions within 30 days after
delivery of the Adjustment Notice, then Seller will be deemed to have
irrevocably accepted the Final Adjusted Purchase Price Statement, in which
case, the Final Adjusted Purchase Price Statement will be final and binding on
the parties for purposes of this Agreement. During such 30-day period, Buyer
and the Company shall provide to Seller all information, records, data and
working papers, and access to such employees, accountants and representatives
of Buyer or the Company, during normal business hours, as may be reasonably
requested by Seller for the purpose of reviewing and evaluating the
information contained in the Final Adjusted Purchase Price Statement.

(c) Resolution Efforts. The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to reach
an agreement with respect to the disputed items within the 30 days following
delivery of the Dispute Notice, or such longer period as may be agreed upon in
writing by the parties (the "Resolution Period"). During the Resolution
Period, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to provide promptly to
the other parties all information, records, data and working papers, and
access to employees as such other party will reasonably request in connection
with the resolution of the Dispute Notice, and will otherwise cooperate in
good faith with such other party to arrive at a final determination of the
Final Adjusted Purchase Price Statement.





(d) Disputes. If, at the end of the Resolution Period, Seller and Buyer have
not resolved in writing the matters specified in the Dispute Notice, then the
parties agree that they shall jointly refer such dispute to the Accountants.
Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Accountants to issue a report to Buyer and
Seller setting forth their determination, in detail, of the amount of each
component of the Adjusted Purchase Price calculated in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, within 30 days after any dispute is referred to them,
and such determination shall be final and binding upon the parties for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Accountants may not assign a value greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Seller or
smaller than the smallest value claimed by either Buyer or Seller and will be
instructed to resolve only those items or amounts in Buyer's calculation as to
which Seller has disputed in the Dispute Notice and that remain unresolved.
Seller and Buyer shall provide the Accountants with all financial information
concerning the business of the Company that is reasonably requested by the
Accountants for purposes of making the determination required by this Section
1.05(d) (subject to the Accountants having executed a confidentiality
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Buyer
with respect to all information made available pursuant hereto). The fees and
expenses of the Accountants for their review, resolution of any such disputed
items and report under this Section 1.05(d) shall be borne by Buyer and Seller
in inverse proportion as Buyer and Seller, respectively, may prevail on the
matters resolved by the Accountants under this Section 1.05(d) (determined
based on the final determination of the disputed items, measured in terms of
dollars, relative to the aggregate dollar amount of the items in dispute),
which proportionate allocation shall also be determined by the Accountants and
included in the report delivered to Buyer and Seller by the Accountants.

(e) Adjustment Payment. If as a result of the final determination of the
Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 1.05:

(i) the Adjusted Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section
1.05 exceeds the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price, then within five (5)
Business Days after the date of the final determination of the Adjusted
Purchase Price, (A) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such excess by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Seller and (B) Buyer and Seller will jointly instruct
the Escrow Agent to disburse to Seller, out of the Purchase Price
Adjustment/Special Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Seller, an amount equal to
$500,000; or

(ii) the Adjusted Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.05 is less than the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price, within five
(5) Business Days after the date of the final determination of the Adjusted
Purchase Price, Buyer and Seller will jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (A)
disburse to Buyer, out of the Purchase Price Adjustment/Special Escrow Amount,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Buyer, an amount equal to such shortfall (the "Purchase Price
Adjustment Shortfall") and (B) if the Purchase Price Adjustment Shortfall is
less than $500,000, disburse to Seller, out of the Purchase Price
Adjustment/Special Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Seller, an amount equal to
$500,000 minus the Purchase Price Adjustment Shortfall. Seller shall not have
any liability for any amounts due pursuant to this Section 1.05(e)(ii) except
to the extent of the funds available in the Escrow Accounts.

A payment by Buyer or Seller under this Section 1.05(e) will be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by applicable Law.



Section 1.06 Escrow Accounts.

(a) Pursuant to Section 1.03(b)(ii), at the Closing, the Escrow Amount will be
deposited with the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. A
portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the amount set forth on Schedule
1.06(a)(i) will be designated as the "Indemnity Escrow Amount" and deposited
into a separate escrow account (the "Indemnity Escrow Account") and the
remaining portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the amount set forth on
Schedule 1.06(a)(ii) less the Special Escrow Adjustment will be designated as
the "Purchase Price Adjustment/Special Escrow Amount" and deposited into a
separate escrow account (the "Purchase Price Adjustment/Special Escrow
Account"). The Escrow Amount, as adjusted from time to time and including the
principal amount of any Escrow Notes, together with any interest or other
income earned thereon, is referred to herein as the "Escrow Funds." In the
event that Buyer makes any payment on any Escrow Note while such Escrow Note
is held in escrow by the Escrow Agent, any payment of principal or interest on
such Escrow Note shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent to be held as Escrow
Funds. Any Escrow Funds held in the Purchase Price Adjustment/Special Escrow
Account will serve as a security for, and a source of payment of, (i) the
adjustment of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.05(e)(ii), if
any, and (ii) any amounts owed to Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 6.02(a)(iv), Section 6.02(a)(v), Section 6.02(a)(vi), Section
6.02(a)(vii), Section 6.02(a)(viii), Section 6.02(a)(ix), Section 6.02(a)(x)
and Section 6.02(xi). Any Escrow Funds held in the Indemnity Escrow Account
will serve as a security for, and source of payment of, (A) any amounts owed
to Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 6.02(a)(i), Section

Section 1.07 Earn-Out.

(a) Earn-Out Payment Statement. Within 75 days after the end of each Earn-Out
Period, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "Earn-Out
Statement"), certified by Buyer's Chief Accounting Officer, setting forth the
calculation of the Earn-Out Amount for such Earn-Out Period, which shall
include reasonably itemized detail of Buyer's calculation of RushCard GPR
Revenue and YOY Growth for such Earn-Out Period.

(b) Dispute Notice. Within 45 days after delivery of the Earn-Out Statement,
Seller may either:

(i) agree in writing with Buyer's calculations, in which case such
calculations will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of this
Agreement; or

(ii) dispute Buyer's calculations by delivering to Buyer a written notice (the
"Earn-Out Dispute Notice") setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
each such disputed item and Seller's calculation, in detail, of what Seller
believes is the amount of the RushCard GPR Revenue, YOY Growth and the
resulting Earn-Out Amount.

If Seller fails to take either of the foregoing actions within 45 days after
delivery of the Earn-Out Statement, then Seller will be deemed to have
irrevocably accepted such Earn-Out Statement, in which case, the Earn-Out
Amount set forth in such Earn-Out Statement will be final and binding on the
parties for purposes of this Agreement. During such 45-day period, Buyer and
the Company shall provide to Seller all information, records, data and working
papers, and access to such employees, accountants and representatives of Buyer
or the Company, during normal business hours, as may be reasonably requested
by Seller for the purpose of reviewing and evaluating the information
contained in the Earn-Out Statement.

(c) Resolution Efforts. The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to reach
an agreement with respect to the disputed items within the 30 days following
delivery of the Earn-Out Dispute Notice, or such longer period as may be
agreed upon in writing by the parties (the "Earn-Out Resolution Period").
During the Earn-Out Resolution Period, each party will use its reasonable best
efforts to provide promptly to the other parties all information, records,
data and working papers, and access to employees as such other party will
reasonably request in connection with the resolution of the Earn-Out Dispute
Notice, and will otherwise cooperate in good faith with such other party to
arrive at a final determination of the Earn-Out Amount for the applicable
Earn-Out Period.

(d) Disputes. If, at the end of the Earn-Out Resolution Period, Seller and
Buyer have not resolved in writing the matters specified in the Earn-Out
Dispute Notice, then the parties agree that they shall jointly refer such
dispute to the Accountants. Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Accountants to
issue a report to Buyer and Seller setting forth their determination, in
detail, of the Earn-Out Amount for the applicable Earn-Out Period and each
component thereof, including, without limitation, the RushCard GPR Revenue and
YOY Growth for such Earn-Out Period, calculated in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, within 30 days after such dispute is referred to them, and
such determination will be final and binding upon the parties for all purposes
of this Agreement. The Accountants may not assign a value greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Seller or smaller than
the smallest value claimed by either Buyer or Seller and will be instructed to
resolve only those items or amounts in the Earn-Out Statement that Seller has
disputed in the Earn-Out Dispute Notice and that remain unresolved. The
Company and Buyer shall provide the Accountants with all financial information
concerning the RushCard GPR Business that is reasonably requested by the
Accountants for purposes of



making the determination required by this Section 1.07(d) (subject to the
Accountants having executed a confidentiality agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer with respect to all information made
available pursuant hereto). The fees and expenses of the Accountants for their
review, resolution of any such disputed items and report under this Section
1.07(d) shall be borne by Buyer and Seller in inverse proportion as Buyer and
Seller, respectively, may prevail on the matters resolved by the Accountants
under this Section 1.07(d) (determined based on the final determination of the
disputed items, measured in terms of dollars, relative to the aggregate dollar
amount of the items in dispute), which proportionate allocation shall also be
determined by the Accountants and included in the report delivered to Buyer
and Seller by the Accountants.

(e) Earn-Out Payments. Within five (5) Business Days after the end of each of
the first three calendar quarters during an Earn-Out Period Buyer shall pay to
Seller the Earn-Out Prepayment Amount for such quarter. Within five (5)
Business Days after a final determination of the RushCard GPR Revenue, YOY
Growth and the resulting Earn-Out Amount for such Earn-Out Period, pursuant to
this Section 1.07, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount equal to (i) such
Earn-Out Amount minus (ii) the sum of the Earn-Out Prepayment Amounts paid
during such Earn-Out Period pursuant to the preceding sentence. All payments
under this Section 1.07(e) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Seller. A
payment by Buyer under this Section 1.07(e) will be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law. Buyer may not offset any claim it may have against Seller in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby against the
Earn-Out Payments.

(f) Buyer Covenant. Seller acknowledges and agrees that (i) during the Earn-
Out Periods, Buyer is free to operate the RushCard GPR Business in a manner
determined by Buyer, in its sole discretion, to be in the best interest of
Buyer and its stockholders, which may include reducing operating expenses
(including marketing expenses) and consolidating operations (including
consolidation of staff members and facilities) in order to achieve the most
efficient cost per funded customer, and (ii) the $4,000,000 twelve-month
minimum in Earn-Out Payments are provided in connection with Buyer's right to
operate the RushCard GPR Business in such manner. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer agrees to not take any action the primary purpose of which is
to reduce the Earn-Out Amounts.

Section 1.08 Tax Withholdings. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Buyer (or any other party making a payment pursuant to this
Agreement) shall be entitled to withhold and deduct from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
such Person is required to deduct and withhold therefore under the Code or any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made. Any Tax required to be
withheld on amounts payable under this Agreement by Buyer (or any other party
making a payment pursuant to this Agreement) to Seller will be paid by Buyer
(or any other party making such payment) on behalf of Seller to the
appropriate governmental authority, and Buyer (or any other party making such
payment) will furnish Seller with official receipts evidencing the payment of
such Tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to deducting or withholding any
amounts from any payment hereunder in respect of Taxes (other than any backup
withholding or any such Tax that is imposed on consideration treated as
compensation for U.S. federal income Tax purposes), Buyer (or any other party
making such payment) will use commercially reasonable efforts to give advance
notice to Seller and reasonably cooperate with Seller in order to execute and
file any forms or certificates requested by Seller that are reasonably
required to claim an available reduced rate of, or exemption from, any such
deduction or withholding.

benefit of any current or former employee, officer, manager or individual
consultant of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or with respect to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation or liability (including

qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to the Code effected

be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of such Benefit Plan.

Section 2.12 Intellectual Property.

(a) Schedule 2.12(a) contains a complete list of (i) Patents, Trademark
registrations and pending applications for Trademark registration and
Copyright registrations and pending applications for Copyright registration
that are owned by the Company or any Affiliate thereof, stating for each
whether it is owned by the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company or another
Affiliate thereof and (ii) domain name registrations in the name of the
Company or any Affiliate ("Registered IP") and other works protected by
Copyright that are material to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries ("Unregistered Works"), stating for each whether it is owned by
the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company or another Affiliate thereof. The
Company or an Affiliate thereof solely owns all right, title and interest in
and to all Registered IP and Unregistered Works, free and clear of any Liens
other than Permitted Liens. No Person has made any claim or allegation
challenging the sole ownership by the Company or any of its Affiliates of any
Registered IP or Unregistered Works and to Seller's knowledge, there is no
potential basis for any such claim or allegation. Neither the Company nor any
Affiliate thereof has granted to any third Person any rights under or with
respect to any Registered IP or Unregistered Works which rights are material
to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) All of the Registered IP is subsisting, valid and enforceable. No Person
has made any claim or allegation against the Company or any of its Affiliates
challenging the validity or enforceability of any Registered IP or
Unregistered Works, and, to Seller's knowledge, no such challenge is
threatened and there is no potential basis for any such challenge. None of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate thereof has taken any action
or failed to take any action that should reasonably be expected to result in
the abandonment, cancellation, forfeiture, relinquishment, invalidation or
unenforceability of any of the Registered IP. All filing, examination,
issuance, post registration and maintenance fees, annuities and the like that
have come due and are required to maintain, preserve or



renew any of the Registered IP that is material to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been timely paid.

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and all other agreements contemplated herein, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein, will not result in any obligation of Seller,
the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates to grant to any Person any
rights with respect to Intellectual Property.

(d) To the extent any Intellectual Property owned by and material to the
business of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries has been developed or
created by a third Person for the Company or such Subsidiary, the Company or
such Subsidiary is the owner of such Intellectual Property as a "work-made for
hire" within the meaning of the United States Copyright Act and the copyright
laws of other relevant jurisdictions or pursuant to executed enforceable
written assignments from such third Person to the Company or such Subsidiary.

(e) All use and distribution of any Open Source Software by the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms of the license under
which such Open Source Software is licensed to the Company or such Subsidiary,
including all copyright notice and attribution requirements. The Company and
its Subsidiaries have not used Open Source Software in a manner that obligates
them to disclose, make available, offer or deliver any portion of the source
code of any proprietary software of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any Person.

(f) To the knowledge of Seller, the conduct of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries does not misappropriate, infringe, dilute or violate any
Intellectual Property rights of any other Person and the Company has not
received any written communications alleging such. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the term "knowledge" means the actual or deemed knowledge of the
persons listed in Section 8.12(iiii); an individual will be deemed to have
knowledge of a particular fact, circumstance, event or other matter if such
knowledge would have been obtained as a result of inquiry that would
reasonably be expected from an individual who has the duties and
responsibilities of such individual in the customary performance of such
duties and responsibilities. To the knowledge of Seller, no Person is
misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating any Intellectual Property
owned by and material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in a manner
that has or would have a material impact on the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

(g) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable steps in
accordance with industry practices to maintain its rights in Registered IP and
to maintain the confidentiality of all information that constitutes or
constituted a Trade Secret material to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (except where the Company, in the exercise of reasonable business
judgment, has affirmatively elected not to protect such information). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except as listed in Schedule
2.12(g), each employee and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is
involved in the development or creation of Registered IP or Unregistered Works
or has had access to such Trade Secrets has executed and delivered to the
Company a proprietary information and inventions agreement, and each
consultant to the Company and its Subsidiaries that is involved in the
development or creation of Registered IP or Unregistered Works or has had
access to such Trade Secrets has executed and delivered to the Company a
consulting agreement, in each case substantially in the forms previously
delivered to Buyer. Seller has no knowledge that any of such employees,
officers or consultants of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in material
violation thereof.





(h) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.12(h), the Company and its Subsidiaries
have sufficient title and ownership of or licenses to all Intellectual
Property necessary for its business as previously conducted at any time, as
now conducted, or as presently proposed to be conducted, without any violation
or infringement of, or other conflict with, the Intellectual Property or other
rights of any Person.

Section 2.13 Assets; Absence of Liens. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.13,
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns, leases or has the legal right to
use all property, all of the material assets and rights used or intended to be
used in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
otherwise owned, leased or licensed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(all such properties, assets and rights, the "Company Assets"). The Company or
one of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to, or in the case of
leased or licensed Company Assets, a valid and subsisting leasehold interest
or licensee interest in, all the Company Assets free and clear of all Liens
except Permitted Liens. The Company Assets constitute all assets necessary for
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted. The equipment of the Company and its Subsidiaries is, taken as a
whole, in good operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear
excepted.

Section 2.14 Real Property. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
owns, or has ever owned, any real property. Schedule 2.14 lists (a) the street
addresses of all real property leased by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
"Leased Real Property"), (b) all real estate lease agreements (including all
amendments, extensions, renewals, guaranties and other agreements with respect
thereto) for the Leased Real Property (the "Leases"), and (c) with respect to
each Lease, (i) the term, (ii) the base rent currently payable and (iii) the
landlord and tenant. The Company has delivered to Buyer a true and complete
copy of each Lease. Each Lease is legal, valid and binding, and is enforceable
against the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, and, to Seller's knowledge,
against the other party thereto, and is in full force and effect (subject to
the effects of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
moratorium, sponsorship or other Applicable Law relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity, whether
considered at law or in equity) and neither the Company nor such Subsidiary
nor, to Seller's knowledge, the applicable landlord thereunder, is in material
default under such Lease, and no event has occurred that, upon the giving of
notice and/or the passing of time, would constitute a material default under
such Lease, except, in each case, as would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Section 2.15 Taxes.

(a) All income and other material Tax Returns which are due and required to be
filed by Seller (solely with respect to the ownership, operation or management
of the business or assets of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries), the

all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects.
All material Taxes of Seller (solely with respect to the ownership, operation

or assets of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries), the Company or any of

in a jurisdiction where the Seller (solely with respect to



the ownership, operation or management of the business or assets of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries), the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the Seller, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction.

another Person by reason of U.S. Treasury regulation Section 1.1502-6, as a

which the period of assessment or collection remains open. There are no
current or pending audits or examinations, requests for information or other
administrative proceedings with respect to any Taxes of the Seller (solely
with respect to the ownership, operation or management of the business or
assets of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries), the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, and no such audits, examinations, requests for
information or other administrative proceedings are, to the Seller's
knowledge, threatened against the Seller, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries. All deficiencies asserted, or assessments made,
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of any examinations
by any taxing authority have been fully paid. None of the Seller (solely with
respect to the ownership, operation or management of the business or assets of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries), the Company nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries or predecessor thereto, has waived in writing any
statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed in writing to any
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, or has made
any request for any such extension or waiver.

(f) There are no Liens for Taxes upon any of the assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, except for statutory liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable.

(g) From the date of its formation, Seller has been classified as a
partnership for U.S. federal and state income Tax purposes. From the date of
its formation, the Company has been disregarded as an entity separate from
Seller for U.S. federal and state income Tax purposes, and will be so
classified up to the Closing.

(h) None of the Seller (solely with respect to the ownership, operation or
management of the business or assets of the Company and any of its

and will be enforceable by, each officer and director entitled to
indemnification under this Section, his or her heirs and his or her

rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by
contract or otherwise.

Section 4.08 Employee Matters.

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing thereafter for
twelve (12) months, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause the Company and its
Affiliates to provide, employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing who continue employment with the Company following the Closing (the
"Company Employees") with (i) annual base salary, wage levels or commissions
that are no less favorable than the base salary, wage levels or commissions
provided to each such Company Employee by the Company or its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefits (excluding
incentive compensation) that are no less favorable than either (A) the
employee benefits (excluding incentive compensation) provided to each such
Company Employee by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing or (B) the employee benefits (excluding incentive compensation)
provided by Buyer and its Subsidiaries to similarly situated employees.

(b) Under the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements established or
maintained by Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates in which

Benefit Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited for all purposes

accrual and eligibility to receive benefits, but excluding benefit accrual for
defined benefit pension plans or retiree medical benefits) for full or partial
years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any of their
respective predecessors); provided that such crediting of service shall not
operate to duplicate any



benefit or the funding of any benefit. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) Buyer intends to conduct the enrollment (the
timing of which remains in Buyer's sole discretion) of Company Employees into
any New Benefit Plans providing health or welfare benefits that replace
coverage under similar or comparable Benefit Plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (such plans, collectively, the "Old Benefit Plans") in such a
manner that there is no gap in Company Employees' eligibility for such
benefits and (ii) for purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Buyer,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cause all preexisting condition
exclusions of such New Benefit Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions were waived
or were inapplicable under any similar or comparable Old Benefit Plan.

(c) This Section 4.08 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 4.08,
express or implied, shall confer upon any employee, or any legal
representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 4.08, express or implied, shall be deemed
to limit the right of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
to (i) terminate the employment of any Company Employee at any time, or (ii)
change or modify any employee benefit plan or arrangement in accordance with
their terms, or shall be deemed an amendment of any plan providing benefits to
any employee.

Section 4.09 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, whether
or not the Closing takes place, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the related documents and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the fees and expenses of all
financial advisors, accountants and legal counsel) shall be paid by the party
hereto incurring such fees, costs and expenses.

Section 4.10 Financing.

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and consummate bank
financing, a placement of convertible notes and/or other source of debt
financing (the "Financing") as promptly as practicable in order to obviate the
need to deliver any Escrow Note or Purchase Price Note at Closing. In the
interest of clarity, completion of the Financing is not a condition to
Closing.

(b) The Company shall provide to Buyer such cooperation and information as is
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the Financing, including (i)
participating in meetings and presentations with prospective lenders and
investors, (ii) providing Buyer with customary historical and projected
financial information and data, including, to the extent reasonably available,
(A) audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2016 and (B) unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries for each
month in 2017, (iii) providing customary and reasonable information for
inclusion in offering documents, bank information memoranda and similar
documents and materials for the Financing, and (iv) providing customary and
reasonable information to assist Buyer in the preparation, execution and
delivery of any credit agreement, indenture, underwriting agreement, purchase
agreement or other customary documents and certificates with respect to the
Financing.







(c) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to update any information
provided to Buyer pursuant to Section 4.10(b) as may be necessary so that such
information does not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to
state any fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not materially
misleading.

(d) None of Seller, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries,

reimbursed by Buyer, (ii) agree to provide any indemnity in connection with
the Financing or its performance of its obligations under this Section 4.10
and any information utilized in connection therewith, provided, that,

indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of Seller and the Company and their
respective partners, members, directors, managers, officers, employees,

all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,

case other than to the extent arising out of a material misstatement or
omission in information provided to Buyer by or on behalf of Seller or the
Company pursuant to this Section 4.10. If the Closing does not occur, Buyer
shall, promptly upon request of Seller at any time after the termination of

necessary in order to effect and otherwise complete the transactions

respective terms, but not to exceed the applicable statute of limitations.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any time
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, an Indemnified
Party timely delivers to an Indemnifying Party a notice in accordance with
Section 6.04 or Section 6.05 asserting a good faith claim for indemnification
under this Article VI, such claim shall not be barred by the expiration of the
applicable survival period.

Section 6.02 Indemnification Obligations.

(a) Seller's Indemnification Obligations. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this Article VI, Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
solely out of the Escrow Funds, Buyer Indemnified Parties against and in
respect of, any and all Losses that Buyer Indemnified Parties shall incur or
suffer, and which arise from or are attributable to by reason of or in
connection with (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any of Seller's
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, (ii) any breach of
any covenant or other obligation of Seller contained in this Agreement, (iii)
all Pre-Closing Taxes, (iv) the CFPB Investigation, (v) the Meta Bank
Underfunding, (vi) the BSA Examination, (vii) the Class Action Settlement,
(viii) any claim relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
made by any member of Seller or any holder of Seller Options or phantom
interests in Seller, (ix) the Kansas Matter, (x) the Opt-Out Claim or (xi) any
claim for royalty payments under the Dynasty Card Agreements.

(b) Buyer's Indemnification Obligations. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this Article VI, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller Indemnified
Parties against and in respect of any and all Losses that Seller Indemnified
Parties shall incur or suffer, and which arise from or are attributable to by

representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, or (ii) any breach
of any covenant or other obligation of Buyer contained in this Agreement.



Section 6.03 Limits on Indemnification Liability. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary:

(a) Neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor Seller, on the other hand, shall have
any liability for an individual claim or group of related claims under Section
6.02(a)(i) or Section 6.02(b)(i), as applicable, unless the amount of Losses
relating to, arising from or with respect to such claim or group of related
claims exceeds the Per Claim Threshold, it being understood that any such
individual claim or group of related claims for amounts less than the Per
Claim Threshold will be ignored for purposes of determining whether the Basket
Amount has been exceeded; provided, however, that no such limitations shall
apply to liability relating to, arising from or with respect to breach or
inaccuracy of Fundamental Representations or the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2.15.

(b) Neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor Seller, on the other hand, shall have
any liability for indemnification claims under Section 6.02(a)(i) or Section
6.02(b)(i), as applicable, until the aggregate Losses relating to, arising
from or with respect to all such claims exceeds the Basket Amount, in which
event Buyer or Seller, as applicable, will be required to pay or be liable for
all Losses in excess of the Basket Amount; provided, however, that no such
limitations shall apply to liability relating to, arising from or with respect
to breach or inaccuracy of Fundamental Representations or the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 2.15.

(c) Seller's maximum aggregate liability for all indemnification claims under
this Article VI shall not exceed the Cap Amount. At any given time the
remaining portion of the Escrow Funds in the Escrow Accounts will be the sole
source of recovery with respect to Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section
6.02(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, after the
Closing, on the date that the funds in the Escrow Accounts are reduced to
zero, Buyer Indemnified Parties will have no further rights to indemnification
under Section 6.02(a).

(d) Buyer's maximum aggregate liability for indemnification claims under
Section 6.02(b)(i) shall not exceed the Cap Amount.

(e) For purposes of determining (i) the existence of any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any of the representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement (other than the representations or warranties set forth in the
second sentence of Section 2.01(a), Section 2.06, Section 2.07, and Section
2.10(a)), and (ii) the amount of any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder
with respect to such breaches and inaccuracies, the applicable representations
and warranties shall be read without regard and without giving effect to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar standard or qualification
contained therein.

(f) No party hereto shall be liable for any punitive, special or exemplary
damages arising out of or in connection with any breach of this Agreement,
except in the case of punitive, special or exemplary damages if and to the
extent any such damages are recovered by a third party against such
Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third Party Claim.

Section 6.04 Procedure for Indemnification with Respect to Direct Claims. A
Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
"Indemnified Party") will promptly notify the party or parties liable for such
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of any claim in respect
of which indemnity may be sought under this Article VI (excluding claims
resulting from a Third Party Claim, which shall be governed by the provisions
of Section 6.05), including in such notice a brief description of the facts
upon which such claim is based and, if available or if able to be reasonably
estimated, the estimated amount of the indemnifiable Losses thereof; provided,
however, that failure to



give such notice shall not affect the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have
twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of the notice of claim to (a) agree in
writing to pay the amount set forth in the notice of claim or (b) provide the
Indemnified Party with written notice that it disputes the claim for
indemnification. In the event that the Indemnifying Party contests the
assertion of a claim by giving such written notice to the Indemnified Party
within such period or fails to agree in writing to pay the amount set forth in
the notice of claim, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an
attempt to reach an expeditious resolution of the matter prior to pursuing
further action.

Section 6.05 Procedure for Indemnification with Respect to Third Party Claims.

(a) If an Indemnified Party determines to seek indemnification under this
Article VI with respect to a claim resulting from the assertion of liability
by third parties (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall
promptly give written notice to the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party
Claim and the facts upon which any such Third Party Claim is based, which
notice shall set forth such information with respect thereto as is then
reasonably available to such Indemnified Party (together with a copy of all
complaints, pleadings, communications, or other written notices provided by
the third party in such Third Party Claim, subject to the attorney-client
privilege); provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the
Indemnified Party's right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim at its own expense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, if such Indemnifying Party so elects by written notice
delivered to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days after
receiving the Indemnified Party's notice of such Third Party Claim. In any
case where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate (at the
Indemnified Party's expense unless the Third Party Claim asserts criminal
liability against the Indemnified Party) in the defense, compromise, or
settlement of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise such
Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment, injunction or order in
respect thereof. The parties hereto shall make available to each other all
relevant information in their possession material to any Third Party Claim,
subject to the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine,
and all other applicable legal and professional privileges.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party, within twenty (20) Business Days
after receipt of the aforesaid notice of a Third Party Claim, fails to assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party
Claim (and the reasonable fees and expenses of such defense, and all other
Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party
Claim, shall be Losses subject to indemnification by the Indemnifying Party
hereunder after application of all applicable limitations set forth in this
Article VI). The Indemnified Party shall not compromise or settle any such
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned,
unless such settlement will not involve any liability or other obligation on
the part of the Indemnifying Party.



Section 6.06 Satisfaction of Indemnification Claims.

(a) In the event of any obligation of Seller to indemnify Buyer Indemnified
Parties, not later than five (5) Business Days after the resolution of such
indemnification claim, Buyer and Seller shall issue joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to release the amount of such indemnification claim to
Buyer from

(i) the Indemnity Escrow Account in the case of any claim pursuant to Section
6.02(a)(i), Section 6.02(a)(ii) or Section 6.02(a)(iii), or

(ii) the Purchase Price Adjustment/Special Escrow Account in the case of any
claim pursuant to Section 6.02(a)(iv), Section 6.02(a)(v), Section
6.02(a)(vi), Section 6.02(a)(vii), Section 6.02(a)(viii), Section 6.02(a)(ix),
Section 6.02(a)(x) or Section 6.02(a)(xi), provided that if the then current
balance of the Purchase Price Adjustment/Special Escrow Account is
insufficient to pay such claim and the Expiration Date has not yet elapsed,
then any shortfall may be released from the Indemnity Escrow Account to the
extent of available funds therein,

in each case in accordance with the terms of, and procedures set forth in, the
Escrow Agreement.

(b) In the event of any obligation of Buyer to indemnify Seller Indemnified
Parties, such indemnified obligation shall be paid in cash directly by Buyer
to the applicable Seller Indemnified Parties by wire transfer of immediately
available funds not later than five (5) Business Days after the resolution of
such indemnification claim.

Section 6.07 Sole Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement and except (i) with respect to the matters covered by Section 1.05
and (ii) in the case where a party seeks to obtain specific performance
pursuant to Section 8.09, the Company, Seller and Buyer hereby agree that
following the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties for any
breach or inaccuracy of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement will be the applicable indemnification
rights set forth in this Article VI.

Section 6.08 Purchase Price Adjustment. Except as otherwise required by Law,
any payments made pursuant to this Article VI (including satisfaction of
indemnification obligations from the Escrow Funds) shall constitute an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

Section 6.09 No Double Recovery. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, no party will be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement
under any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such party
has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision
of this Agreement. Further, the amount of any Losses for which indemnification
is provided under this Article VI shall be net of (i) the amount of such Loss
that is specifically reflected as an accrued liability in the Final Adjusted
Purchase Price Statement, (ii) any insurance proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Party with respect to the matter to which the indemnification
claim relates (reduced by the amount of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with such recovery, any deductibles paid and the portion of any
increase in premiums for such insurance policies directly resulting from such
matter), and (iii) any indemnity or contribution amounts actually recovered by
such Indemnified Party from third parties (reduced by the amount of any out-
of-pocket expenses incurred in procuring such recovery or Taxes imposed on the
Indemnified Party in respect of such amounts), in each case with respect to
such Losses. In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers under any
insurance policy or from any third party, any amount in respect of a matter
for



which such Indemnified Party was indemnified pursuant to Section 6.02, in each
case to the extent not already taken into account pursuant to this Section
6.09, such Indemnified Party will promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party
the amount so recovered (subject to any applicable Tax withholding and reduced
by the amount of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in procuring such
recovery or Taxes imposed on the Indemnified Party in respect of such
amounts), but not in excess of the sum of (x) any amount previously so paid to
or on behalf of such Indemnified Party in respect of such matter and (y) any
amount expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim
arising out of such matter.

Section 6.10 Knowledge No Effect. No party's knowledge of any liability or
breach of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
(whether such knowledge is gained by such party's investigation or by
disclosure to such party by the other party) will affect such party's right to
indemnification for such liability or breach as herein provided.

Article VII. TERMINATION

Section 7.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the effectiveness of
the other agreements contemplated hereby) may be abandoned at any time prior

(b) by either Buyer of Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or

would not be satisfied ("Terminating Seller Breach"); provided, however, that,
if such Terminating Seller Breach is curable through the exercise of Seller's
reasonable best efforts and Seller continues to exercise such reasonable best
efforts, Buyer may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.01(d)
during the 15-day period following delivery of written notice to Seller of
such Terminating Seller Breach; provided, further, that Buyer will not have
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.01(d) if Buyer is

covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement;

(e) by Seller upon a material breach of any covenant or agreement on the part
of Buyer set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of

Terminating Buyer Breach is curable through the exercise of reasonable best
efforts and Buyer continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts, Seller

is then in material breach or violation of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

Section 7.02 Effect of Termination. Following the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and of no further force and effect, there shall be no liability under this

hereto shall cease; provided, however, that (a) Section 4.02(b), Section 4.05,
Section 4.10(d), this Section 7.02, and Article VIII (other than Section 8.09)
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO
ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT ENTERED INTO

severable from every other provision of this Agreement. If any provision of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or
unenforceable, in whole or in part, or unreasonable or excessive in scope or
duration with the result that such provision (or portion thereof) as drafted
is void or unenforceable, such circumstances shall not have the effect of
rendering such provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in
