 \t\t\t\t

Company Preferred Shares and Company Warrants, for exchange in accordance with
this _Article III_ , through the Exchange Agent, New Common Shares and cash as
required by this _Article III_. Parent agrees to make available to the
Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay the cash
portion of the Mixed Consideration, the Cash Consideration, the Preferred
Share Consideration, and any distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and to
make payments in lieu of any fractional New Common Shares pursuant to _Section
3.3(d)_ , in each case without interest. Any cash as payment for any
fractional New Common Shares in accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_ , any
distributions with respect to New Common Shares in accordance with _Section
3.3(c)_ , and New Common Shares and cash for payment of the Merger
Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent are hereinafter referred to as
the " _ **Exchange Fund**_." The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions from Parent and the Company, deliver the Merger Consideration,
and the Preferred Share Consideration contemplated to be paid for Company
Common Shares, Company Warrants and Company Preferred Shares, as applicable,
pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by
_Sections 3.3(c)_ and _3.3(d)_ , the Exchange Fund will not be used for any
other purpose.

 \t\t\t\t

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Company Common
Shares as of the Effective Time (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries
and Parent and its Subsidiaries) (i) a letter of transmittal (specifying that
in respect of certificated Company Common Shares, delivery will be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which will be in
customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective
Time) and (ii) instructions (in customary form and agreed to by Parent and the
Company prior to the Effective Time) for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of Company Common Shares represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon
surrender of Certificates, if any, for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with such letters of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents (including in respect of Book-Entry Shares)
as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, each holder who
held Company Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries) will be
entitled to receive upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
therefor (x) New Common Shares representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of New Common Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to this _Article III_ (after taking into account all Company Common Shares
then held by such holder) and/or (y) a check in an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
this _Article III_ , including (A) cash in an amount (subject to any
applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product of (x) the number of Company
Common Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in the name of such holder multiplied by (y) the
Cash Consideration or the cash portion of the Mixed Consideration, if and as
applicable, (B) cash payable in lieu of any fractional New Common Shares
pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ and (C) distributions pursuant to _Section
3.3(c)_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration,
Preferred Share Consideration, any cash payment in lieu of fractional New
Common Shares, or any Parent distributions payable pursuant to _Section
3.3(c)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such Company Common Shares may be paid to
a transferee, if the Certificate representing such Company Common Shares or
evidence of ownership of the Book-Entry Shares is presented to the Exchange
Agent, and in the case of both certificated and book-entry Company Common
Shares, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and
effect such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange will pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
record holder of such Company Common Shares, or will establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the Exchange
Agent to follow similar procedures with respect to the surrender of
certificates representing Company Preferred Shares in exchange for the
Preferred Share Consideration payable in respect thereof and Company Warrants
in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. Until all
such required documentation has been delivered and Certificates, if any,
Company Warrants or certificates representing Company Preferred Shares, as
applicable, have been surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.3_ , each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, Company Warrant or certificate representing a
Company Preferred Share, as applicable, will be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, or Preferred Share Consideration payable in respect of such
Company Common Shares, Company Warrants or Company Preferred Shares, as
applicable, upon such delivery and surrender, and any cash or distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Sections 3.3(c)_ and _3.3(d)_.

 \t\t\t\t

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Company Common Shares_. No
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any Company
Common Shares or Company Warrants with respect to New Common Shares that such
holder would be entitled to receive in accordance herewith and no cash payment
in lieu of fractional New Common Shares will be paid to any such holder until
such holder has delivered the required documentation and surrendered any
Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Company Warrants as contemplated by this
_Section 3.3_. Subject to applicable Law, following compliance with the
requirements of _Section 3.3(b)_ , there will be paid to such holder of New
Common Shares issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly
after the time of such compliance, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of
fractional New Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.3(d)_ (which shall be paid by the Exchange Agent as provided
therein) and the amount of distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to New Common Shares and payable
with respect to such New Common Shares, and (ii) promptly after such
compliance, or, if later, at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
delivery and surrender and a payment date subsequent to such compliance
payable with respect to such New Common Shares (which shall be paid by
Parent).

 \t\t\t\t

(d) _Fractional New Common Shares_. No certificates or scrip for New Common
Shares representing fractional New Common Shares or book entry credit of the
same will be issued upon the surrender of Company Common Shares or Company
Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance
with _Section 3.3(b)_ , and such fractional interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any New Common
Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Company Common Shares or Company Warrants converted in the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a New Common Share
(after taking into account all Company Common Shares and Company Warrants
exchanged by such holder) will receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the Average Closing Price as of the Closing Date and (ii) the
fraction of a New Common Share that such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article III_. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments
to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the
terms hereof.

 \t\t\t\t

(e) _No Further Rights in Company Common Shares or Company Warrants_. The
Merger Consideration issued upon conversion of a Company Common Share or
Company Warrant in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid
pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ ) will be deemed to have been issued and/or paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Share or
Company Warrant. From and after the Effective Time, each Company Warrant shall
no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle
such holder to the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such
Company Warrant.

 \t\t\t\t

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares, Company
Preferred Shares or Company Warrants after 180 days following the Effective
Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand by Parent and, from and after
such delivery, any former holders of Company Common Shares, Company Preferred
Shares or Company Warrants who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ will thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration
or other consideration as applicable, payable in respect of such Company
Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares or Company Warrants, any cash in lieu
of fractional New Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.3(d)_ , or any distributions with respect to New Common Shares to
which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ , in each case **,**
without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
Company Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares or Company Warrants
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent. Without limitation
of the foregoing, after 180 days following the Effective Time, any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Common Shares, Company Preferred
Shares or Company Warrants will become the property of Parent, subject to the
legitimate claims of any Person previously entitled thereto hereunder or under
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent, or any other Person shall be liable
to any former holder of Company Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares or
Company Warrants for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate or Company Warrant is lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or a bond, in a
customary amount, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate or Company Warrant, the Exchange Agent will
pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and affidavit
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Company Common Shares
represented by such Certificate or Warrant Notational Common Shares
represented by such Company Warrant, as applicable, and any amounts to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Sections_ _3.3(c)_ and _3.3(d)_.

 \t\t\t\t

(h) _Withholding_. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub, Marshall Texas and the
Exchange Agent are entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts or
securities as the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, Marshall Texas or the Exchange
Agent reasonably deems to be required to deduct and withhold under the Code or
any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making
of such payment or issuance. To the extent that amounts or securities are so
deducted and withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid or issued to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made.

 \t\t\t\t

(i) _Book Entry Shares_. All New Common Shares to be issued in the Merger will
be issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates.

 \t\t\t\t

(j) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to
invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis,
in Parents sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment
or loss thereon affects the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts
payable to the holders of Company Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares,
Company Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company Warrants, as
applicable, pursuant to the other provisions of this _Section 3.3_ and
_Section 3.7_ , _Section 3.8_ and _Section 3.9_. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments will be paid promptly to Parent.

 \t\t\t\t

(k) _Tax Characterization of Merger_. The Company and Parent each acknowledges
and agrees that for U.S. federal income Tax purposes the Integrated Mergers
are intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to prepare and file
all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in accordance with the foregoing and shall
not take any position inconsistent therewith on any such Tax Return, or in the
course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to U.S.
federal income Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws
following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
final administrative decision by an applicable Taxing Authority.

 \t\t\t\t

 **3.4 ** ** _Election Procedures_**. Each holder of record of a Company
Common Share or Company Warrant issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Election Deadline (a " _ **Company Holder**_ ") shall have the right,
subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article III_ , to submit an
election on or prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the following
procedures:

 \t\t\t\t

(a) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _
**Form of Election**_ "), which shall be mailed by Parent to record holders of
Company Common Shares and Company Warrants so as to permit the Company Holders
to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline.
For the avoidance of doubt, a holder of a Company Warrant may only make one
type of Election (i.e., a Share Election, Mixed Election or Cash Election)
with respect to such Company Warrant.

 \t\t\t\t

(b) Each Company Holder may specify on the Form of Election in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section 3.4_ and the instructions on such form (an " _
**Election**_ "), (i) the number of Company Common Shares with respect to
which such Company Holder desires to make a Share Election, (ii) the number of
Company Common Shares with respect to which such Company Holder desires to
make a Mixed Election, (iii) the number of Company Common Shares with respect
to which such Company Holder desires to make a Cash Election and (iv) with
respect to each Company Warrant held by such Company Holder, whether such
Company Holder desires to make a Share Election, a Mixed Election or a Cash
Election with respect to such Company Warrant. Any holder of Company Common
Shares who makes an Election shall be required to waive all appraisal rights
in connection with the Company Common Shares subject to such Election.

 \t\t\t\t

(c) Parent shall mail or cause to be mailed or delivered, as applicable, the
Form of Election to the holders of the Company Warrants and to record holders
of Company Common Shares as of the record date for the Company Meeting not
less than 20 Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline. Parent
shall make available one

 \t\t\t\t

or more Forms of Election as may reasonably be requested from time to time by
all persons who become holders of record of Company Common Shares or Company
Warrants during the period following the record date for the Company Meeting
and prior to the Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the
Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for the Exchange Agent to
perform as specified herein.

 \t\t\t\t

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, prior to the Election Deadline, a Form of Election
properly completed and signed and accompanied by Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Certificates), if any, for the Company Common Shares to
which such Form of Election relates, or the Company Warrants to which such
Form of Election relates, as the case may be, duly endorsed in blank or
otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Certificates or Company
Warrants, as applicable, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a firm
that is an eligible guarantor institution (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under
the Exchange Act); _provided_ that such Certificates or Company Warrants, as
applicable, are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required
in such guarantee of delivery, and, in the case of Company Common Shares in
book-entry form, any additional documents specified in the procedures set
forth in the Form of Election. Failure to deliver Company Common Shares or
Company Warrants, as applicable, covered by such a guarantee of delivery
within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any
otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in
its sole and absolute discretion. As used herein, unless otherwise jointly
agreed in advance by the Company and Parent, " _ **Election Deadline**_ "
means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the
Exchange Agent is located) on a date mutually agreed by the Company and Parent
but which in no event shall be less than one (1) day prior to the anticipated
Closing Date. Parent and the Company shall issue a joint press release
reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the anticipated date of the
Election Deadline not more than 15 Business Days before, and at least five
Business Days prior to, the anticipated date of the Election Deadline. Without
limiting the other provisions set forth in this _Section 3.4_ , any Company
Common Shares or Company Warrants with respect to which the Exchange Agent has
not received an effective, properly completed Form of Election prior to the
Election Deadline (other than any Company Common Shares that constitute
Dissenting Shares as of such time) shall also be deemed to be Non-Election
Shares.

 \t\t\t\t

(e) Any Company Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change
or revoke such Company Holders Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly
completed and signed revised Form of Election or by written withdrawal prior
to the Election Deadline of such Company Holders Certificates or Company
Warrants, as applicable, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates
or Company Warrants, or any documents in respect of shares of Company Common
Stock in book-entry form, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. After
an Election is validly made with respect to any Company Common Shares or
Company Warrants, any subsequent transfer of such Company Common Shares or
Company Warrants shall automatically revoke such Election. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Elections shall be
automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written
notification from the Company that this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with _Article IX_. The Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine if any Election is not properly made with respect to
any Company Common Shares or Company Warrants (none of the Parties or the
Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any Company Holder of any such
defect). In the event the Exchange Agent makes such a determination, such
Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the Company Common Shares or
Company Warrant, as applicable, covered by such Election shall, for purposes
hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares or a Non-Election Warrant, as
applicable, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made with respect to
such Company Common Shares or Company Warrant. In the event that any Company
Warrant in respect of which an Election shall have been made is subsequently
exercised, such Election shall automatically be deemed to have been withdrawn
as to such Company Warrant.

 \t\t\t\t

(f) Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right
to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into
account in making the determinations prescribed by _Section 3.5_.

 \t\t\t\t

 **3.5 ** ** _Proration_**.

 \t\t\t\t

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
aggregate number of Company Common Shares and the aggregate number of Warrant
Notional Common Shares represented by all of the Company Warrants to be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ (the " _ **Cash**_ _ **Conversion Number**_ ") shall be equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Cash Component minus the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the sum of the number of Mixed Election Shares and
the aggregate number of Warrant

Notional Common Shares represented by all of the Mixed Election Warrants by
(y) $34.75, by (ii) the Cash Consideration. The " _ **Cash Component**_ "
shall be equal to the amount by which (i) the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the sum of the number of Company Common Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding all Treasury Shares) plus
the number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by all of the Company
Warrants that are outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (B) $34.75, exceeds (ii) the product obtained by multiplying
(1) the number of Dissenting Shares by (2) the Cash Consideration. All other
Company Common Shares and Company Warrants (other than Mixed Election Shares
and Mixed Election Warrants, which shall be converted into the Mixed
Consideration, and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive the Share Consideration, subject to _Section 3.5(b)(iii)_.

 \t\t\t\t

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation of Merger Consideration among the
holders of Company Common Shares and Company Warrants as follows:

 \t\t\t\t

(i) if the sum of the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares and the
aggregate number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by Cash
Election Warrants (such sum, the " _ **Total Cash Election**_ _ **Number**_ ")
exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then (A) all Share Election Shares, all
Share Election Warrants, all Non-Election Shares and all Non-Election Warrants
shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration, (B) all
Mixed Election Shares and all Mixed Election Warrants shall be converted into
the right to receive the Mixed Consideration, (C) Cash Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion
Number and the denominator of which is the Total Cash Election Number (with
the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with _Section 3.5_ , whether
fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the
remaining number of such holders Cash Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Share Consideration, and (D) each Cash Election
Warrant shall be converted into the right to receive (x) the Cash
Consideration in respect of the portion of Warrant Notional Common Shares
represented by such Cash Election Warrant equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by
such Cash Election Warrant by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Total Cash Election
Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with _Section 3.5_ ,
whether fractions of Warrant Notional Common Shares shall be rounded up or
down), and (y) the Share Consideration in respect of the remaining portion of
Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by such Cash Election Warrant;

 \t\t\t\t

(ii) if the Total Cash Election Number equals the Cash Conversion Number, then
(A) all Cash Election Shares and all Cash Election Warrants shall be converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, (B) all Mixed Election
Shares and all Mixed Election Warrants shall be converted into the right to
receive the Mixed Consideration, and (C) all Share Election Shares, all Share
Election Warrants, all Non-Election Shares and all Non-Election Warrants shall
be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration; and

 \t\t\t\t

(iii) if the Total Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion
Number (the amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Total Cash
Election Number being referred to herein as the " _ **Shortfall**_ _
**Number**_ "), then (x) all Cash Election Shares and all Cash Election
Warrants shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration,
(y) all Mixed Election Shares and all Mixed Election Warrants shall be
converted into the right to receive the Mixed Consideration, and (z) the Share
Election Shares, the Share Election Warrants, the Non-Election Shares and the
Non-Election Warrants shall be treated in the following manner:

 \t\t\t\t

(A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the sum of the aggregate
number of all Non-Election Shares and the aggregate number of Warrant Notional
Common Shares represented by all of the Non-Election Warrants (such sum, the "
_ **Aggregate Non-Election Number**_ "), then all Share Election Shares and
all Share Election Warrants shall be converted into the right to receive the
Share Consideration, and (x) the Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof
shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect
of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (2) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator
of which is the Aggregate Non-Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to
determine, consistent with _Section 3.3_ , whether fractions of Non-Election
Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such
holders Non-Election Shares being

converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration, and (y) each Non-
Election Warrant shall be converted into the right to receive (I) the Cash
Consideration in respect of that portion of the Warrant Notional Common Shares
represented by such Company Warrant equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the total number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented
by such Non-Election Warrant by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the Aggregate Non-Election
Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with _Section 3.3_ ,
whether fractions of Warrant Notional Common Shares shall be rounded up or
down), and (II) the Share Consideration with respect to the remaining portion
of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by such Non-Election Warrant; or

 \t\t\t\t

(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the Aggregate Non-Election Number, then
all Non-Election Shares and all Non-Election Warrants shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and (A) the Share Election Shares
of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Share Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Share Election Shares held
by such holder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by
which (x) the Shortfall Number exceeds (y) the Aggregate Non-Election Number,
and the denominator of which is the sum of the total number of Share Election
Shares and the aggregate number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented
by all of the Share Election Warrants (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with this _Section 3.5_ , whether fractions of Share Election
Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such
holders Share Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Share Consideration, and (B) each Share Election Warrant shall be converted
into the right to receive (I) the Cash Consideration in respect of that
portion of the Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by such Company
Warrant equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the total number of
Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by such Share Election Warrant by
(2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (x) the
Shortfall Number exceeds (y) the Aggregate Non-Election Number, and the
denominator of which is the sum of the aggregate number of Share Election
Shares and the total number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by
the Share Election Warrants (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent
with this _Section 3.5_ , whether fractions of Warrant Notional Common Shares
shall be rounded up or down), and (II) the Share Consideration with respect to
the remaining portion of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by such
Share Election Warrant.

 \t\t\t\t

 **3.6 ** ** _Anti-Dilution Provisions_**. Without limiting the covenants
in _Sections 4.1_ and _4.2_ , in the event the outstanding Company Common
Shares or Parent Common Shares shall have been changed between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing into a different number of shares or a
different class after the date hereof by reason of any subdivisions,
reclassifications, splits, share distributions, combinations or exchanges of
Company Common Shares or Parent Common Shares, then the Merger Consideration
will be correspondingly adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common
Shares, Company Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company Warrants, as
applicable, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 3.6_
shall be deemed to permit or authorize any Party hereto to affect any such
change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant
to this Agreement.

 \t\t\t\t

 **3.7 ** ** _Treatment of Company Preferred Shares_**. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company, each Company Preferred Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the
right to receive cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax)
equal to one dollar ($1.00), without interest (the " _ **Preferred Share**_ _
**Consideration**_ "). The Preferred Share Consideration issued upon
conversion of a Company Preferred Share in accordance with the terms hereof
will be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Preferred Share. All Company Preferred Shares
converted into the right to receive the Preferred Share Consideration pursuant
to this _Section 3.7_ will cease to be outstanding and will automatically be
canceled and will cease to exist when converted as a result of and pursuant to
the Merger.

 \t\t\t\t

 **3.8 ** ** _Treatment of Company Options and Company Restricted
Shares_**. 

 \t\t\t\t

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions to
cause all outstanding Company Options to vest immediately prior to the
Effective Time and provide that each Company Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be
exchanged for the number of Parent Common Shares, rounded down to the nearest

whole share, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the product of (A)
the number of Company Common Shares subject to the Company Option and (B) the
amount, if any, by which the per share closing trading price of Company Common
Shares on the Business Day immediately before the Closing Date exceeds the
exercise price per Company Common Share otherwise purchasable pursuant to the
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Average
Closing Price; provided if such calculation results in zero or a negative
number, the applicable Company Option shall be forfeited for no consideration.

 \t\t\t\t

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions to
adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Restricted Shares to provide that,
as of the Effective Time, the Company Restricted Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a number of
restricted Parent Common Shares (" _ **Adjusted Restricted Shares**_ ")
subject to the same vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions equal to
the number of corresponding Company Restricted Shares multiplied by the Share
Consideration, rounded up to the nearest whole share.

 \t\t\t\t

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, all Adjusted Restricted Shares shall be
subject to the same vesting and other terms and restrictions that applied to
the corresponding Company Restricted Share, as applicable, including all
vesting acceleration provisions as may be set forth in an applicable
employment agreement or otherwise.

 \t\t\t\t

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) assume all of the obligations
of the Company under the Company Stock Plans with respect to the outstanding
Adjusted Restricted Shares, and (ii) file one or more appropriate registration
statements (on Form S-3 or Form S-8, or any successor or other appropriate
forms) with respect to all Parent Common Shares underlying Adjusted Restricted
Shares.

 \t\t\t\t

(e) At the Effective Time, if Parent determines that it desires to do so,
Parent may assume any or all of the Company Stock Plans. If Parent assumes any
Company Stock Plan, then, under such Company Stock Plan Parent will be
entitled to grant equity or equity-based incentive awards with respect to
Parent Shares, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, using the share
reserves of such Company Stock Plan (including any Parent Shares returned to
such share reserves as a result of the termination or forfeiture of any equity
awards). If Parent notifies the Company that it does not wish to assume a
Company Stock Plan, the Company shall ensure that such Company Stock Plan is
terminated as of the Effective Time and no future rights remain under such
Company Stock Plan, except with respect to the Adjusted Restricted Shares.

 \t\t\t\t

 **3.9 ** ** _Dissenting Shares_**. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each Company Common Share that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time as to which the holder
thereof shall have properly complied in all respects with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights (each, a " _ **Dissenting
Share**_ "), such Dissenting Share shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be canceled and shall
represent the right to receive only the payment, solely from the Surviving
Company, of the appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent
permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Person shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL, then the right of such Person to receive those rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Company Common Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall
represent only the right to right to receive, the same type of Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, as was payable in respect of an
equivalent number of Non-Election Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Company Common
Shares, and Parent shall have the right to control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, make
any payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to
Dissenting Shares without the written consent of Parent.

Bylaws and each of the Companys Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation,

extent amended by a subsequently filed Company SEC Document prior to the date
hereof, in which case as of the date of such amendment), each Company SEC
Document complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to
the Company SEC Documents, and did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 \t\t\t\t

(b) Any consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (the " _ **Company Financial Statements**_ ") as of

the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand), or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the
SEC), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or
agreement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or

SEC Documents.

 **5.8 ** ** _Internal Controls and Procedures_**. The Company has
established and maintains internal control over financial reporting and
disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15
and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting, including policies
and procedures that (a) mandate the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the material transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in
accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the Company Board
and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its
Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Companys disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their
most recent evaluation, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of
the Company Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of internal controls which could adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for
the Companys auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls. To
the Knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2014, no complaints from any
source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters
have been received by the Company. Since January 1, 2014, the Company has not
received any material complaints through the Companys whistleblower hotline
or equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding possible
violations of applicable Law. Since January 1, 2014, no attorney representing
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of applicable
Law that are securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the
Companys chief legal officer, audit committee of the Company Board or to the
Company Board pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company policy contemplating such reporting. The
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Company
have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange
Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect
to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications were complete and correct as of the dates they were made.

Parent complete copies of all written reports delivered to or received by the
Company or its Subsidiaries on or before the date of this Agreement estimating
the Companys and its Subsidiaries Hydrocarbon reserves with respect to the
Oil and Gas Properties. The factual, non-interpretive data relating to the Oil
and Gas Properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries on which the reserve
reports prepared by Williamson Petroleum Consultants, Inc. and Ryder Scott
Company, LP, in each case, referred to in the Companys Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the " _ **Company Reserve**_

Company, LP, except for any incompleteness or inaccuracy that would not,

material errors in the assumptions and estimates provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve
Reports. The Hydrocarbon reserve estimates of the Company and its Subsidiaries
set forth in the Company Reserve Reports fairly reflect, in all material
respects, the Hydrocarbon reserves of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the
dates indicated therein and are in accordance with the rules promulgated by

therein. Except for changes (including changes in Hydrocarbon commodity
prices) generally affecting the oil and gas industry and normal depletion by
production, there has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in
the Company Reserve Reports that would, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The estimates
of proved Hydrocarbon reserves provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
Williamson Petroleum Consultants, Inc. and Ryder Scott Company, LP,
respectively, in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve
Reports complied in all material respects with Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X

otherwise disposed of since December 31, 2015 under any Company Material
Agreement disclosed on _Section 5.12_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), in
each case free and clear of all Liens, encumbrances, claims and defects and
imperfections of title except (i) such as do not materially, individually or
in the aggregate, affect the value of such property and do not, individually

the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) for Permitted Encumbrances and (iii)
such as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of the foregoing
sentence, "good and indefeasible title" means title that is free from
reasonable doubt to the end that a prudent person engaged in the business of
purchasing and owning, developing, and operating producing or non-producing
Oil and Gas Properties in the geographical areas in which they are located,
with knowledge of all of the facts and their legal bearing, would be willing
to accept, acting reasonably.

 \t\t\t\t

(b) Except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity, each material Oil and Gas Lease (i) constitutes
the valid and binding obligation of the Company or its applicable Subsidiary
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of the other parties thereto, (ii) is in full force and effect, and
(iii) immediately after the Effective Time will continue to constitute a valid
and binding obligation of the Company or its applicable Subsidiary and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, each of the other parties thereto in accordance with
its terms. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (to the extent it is a
party thereto or bound thereby) and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each
other party thereto has performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under each material Oil and Gas Lease. There is
not, to the Knowledge of the Company, under any Oil and Gas Lease, any default
or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the part of any of the parties thereto, or any notice of
termination, cancellation or material modification, in each case, except such
events of default, other events, notices or modifications as to which
requisite waivers or consents have been obtained, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
notice of any material violation or breach of, material default under or
intention to cancel, terminate, modify or not renew any material Oil and Gas
Lease.

 \t\t\t\t

(c) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has good and valid title, in all
material respects, to each material real property (and each material real
property at which its operations are conducted) owned by it (in each case
excluding Oil and Gas Leases and Company Real Property Leases, the " _
**Company Owned Real Property**_ ") except for Permitted Encumbrances. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries has a good and valid leasehold interest in
each lease, sublease and other agreement under which it uses or occupies or
has the right to use or occupy any material real property (or material real
property at which its operations are conducted) (but excluding Oil and Gas
Leases) (such property subject to a lease, sublease or other agreement, the "
_ **Company Leased Real Property**_ " and such leases, subleases and other
agreements are, collectively, the " _ **Company Real Property Leases**_ "), in
each case, free and clear of all Liens other than any Permitted Encumbrances.
Each Company Real Property Lease is valid, binding and in full force and
effect, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to
or affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity.
No uncured default of a material nature on the part of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the landlord thereunder,
exists under any Company Real Property Lease, and no event has occurred or
circumstance exists which, with or without the giving of notice, the passage
of time, or both, would constitute a material breach or default under a
Company Real Property Lease. _Section 5.15(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete list of the Company Owned Real
Property and the Company Leased Real Property (collectively, the " _ **Company
Real Property**_ ").

 \t\t\t\t

(d) There are no leases, subleases, licenses, rights or other agreements
burdening or affecting any portion of the Company Real Property that would
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the existing use of such
Company Real Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the operation of
their respective businesses thereon. Except for such arrangements solely
between or among the Company and its Subsidiaries, there are no outstanding
options or rights of first refusal in favor of any other party to purchase any
Company Owned Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein that
would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the existing use
of the Company Owned Real Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
operation of their respective businesses thereon. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is currently leasing, subleasing, licensing or otherwise
granting any person the right to use or occupy all or any portion of any
Company Real Property that would reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the existing use of such Company Real Property by the Company
and its Subsidiaries in the operation of their respective businesses thereon.
The Company Real Property constitutes all of the material real estate used in
and necessary for the operation of the respective businesses of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

 \t\t\t\t

(a) Since January 1, 2015, Parent has filed with or furnished to the SEC all
forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements required to
be filed or furnished under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. At the
time filed (or, in the case of registration statements, solely on the dates of
effectiveness) (except to the extent amended by a subsequently filed Parent
SEC Document prior to the date hereof, in which case as of the date of such
amendment), each Parent SEC Document complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the
case may be, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Parent SEC Documents and did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 \t\t\t\t

(b) Any consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment): (A) complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and

regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be expressly indicated in the notes thereto), and (iii) will
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated

(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end
adjustments which are not, individually or in the aggregate, material).

 \t\t\t\t

 **6.8 ** ** _Internal Controls and Procedures_**. Parent has established
and maintains internal control over financial reporting and disclosure
controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule
15d-15 under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting, including policies and
procedures that (a) mandate the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the material transactions and
dispositions of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (b) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of Parent and its Subsidiaries are being made only in
accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the Parent Board
and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of Parent and
its Subsidiaries. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that material information relating to Parent, including its
Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Parents
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Parents disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms. Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board
(x) all significant deficiencies, if any, in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect Parents ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal controls. To the Knowledge of Parent,
since January 1, 2014, no complaints from any source regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing matters have been received by Parent.
Since January 1, 2014, Parent has not received any material complaints through
Parents whistleblower hotline or equivalent system for receipt of employee
concerns regarding possible violations of applicable Law. Since January 1,
2014, no attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
violation of applicable Law that are securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty
or similar violation by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to Parents chief legal officer, audit committee of the Parent Board or
to the Parent Board pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Parent policy contemplating such reporting. The
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Parent have
made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act
and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to
the Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications
were complete and accurate as of the dates they were made.

 \t\t\t\t

in the audited financial statements (or notes thereto) included in Parents
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the unaudited
financial statements (or notes thereto) included in Parents Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, and in the
financial statements (or notes thereto) included in subsequent Parent SEC
Documents filed by Parent prior to the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of
its consolidated Subsidiaries had at the Balance Sheet Date, or has incurred
since that date, any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise) of any nature, except liabilities, obligations or
contingencies that (A) are accrued or reserved against in the financial
statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the
date hereof, or reflected in the notes thereto, (B) were incurred since the
Balance Sheet Date and prior to the date hereof in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practices and that would not reasonably be
expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or (C) relate to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to

Subsidiaries has received any written communication since January 1, 2014 from
a Governmental Authority that alleges that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
is not in compliance with or is in default or violation of any applicable Law,
including the FCPA, except where such non-compliance, default or violation
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by any Governmental
Authority with respect to any of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent,
has any Governmental Authority indicated an intention to conduct the same,
except where such investigation or review would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 \t\t\t\t

 **6.12 ** ** _Litigation_**. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their assets or property or to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their assets or property is otherwise a party or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, a threatened party, except for Proceedings that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Merger.

 \t\t\t\t

 **6.13 ** ** _Information Supplied_**. None of the information supplied
(or to be supplied) by or on behalf of Parent specifically for inclusion in
(a) the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement or
any amendment or supplement thereto, is filed with the SEC or at the time it
becomes effective under the Securities Act, or (b) the Proxy Statement (which
will be included as a prospectus in the Registration Statement) will, on the
date the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first
mailed to Company Stockholders, and at the time of the Company Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Registration Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent makes no representation or warranty with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates or
Representatives for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any of the
foregoing documents.

_ **Parent Employee Benefit Plan**_ ") has been operated and administered, in
all material respects, in accordance with its terms, and in compliance with
all applicable Laws, in each case except where the failure to be so
administered or to so comply, would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There are no
proceedings, audits or other claims (except routine claims for benefits
payable under the Parent Employee Benefit Plans) pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Parent, threatened against or involving any Parent Employee Benefit
Plan that would be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

respects with all applicable Law relating to the employment of labor or the
engagement of independent contractors, including all such applicable Law

Taxes owed by Parent and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax

its Subsidiaries that is still pending.

 \t\t\t\t

The Company hereby covenants to and agrees with Parent, and Parent and Merger
Sub hereby covenant to and agree with the Company, on their behalf and on

 \t\t\t\t

 **7.1 ** ** _Consummation of the Merger_**. 

 \t\t\t\t

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section

actions, and do, or cause to be done, promptly and to assist and cooperate
with the Other Party in doing, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to
cause the conditions to the Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable

effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, including
preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
(including any required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust
Laws), (ii) obtain promptly (and in any event no later than the Outside Date)
all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Authority or Third Party necessary, proper or advisable to

or waivers from Third Parties, and (v) execute and deliver any additional

Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) be required to pay any
penalty, compensation or other consideration to any Third Party for any
consent or approval required under any license, contract or agreement for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _ **Antitrust Laws**_ " means the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade

agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby

promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by any
Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by
their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this
_Section_ _7.1_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in
any event no later than the Outside Date). Parent will pay any HSR Act filing
fee.

 \t\t\t\t

(c) Each of the Parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to: (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry
by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Merger, including any
proceeding initiated by a private Person; (ii) promptly inform the Other Party
of (and supply to the Other Party) any communication received by such Party
from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and
any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
by a private Person, in each case regarding the Merger; (iii) permit the Other
Party to review in advance and incorporate the Other Partys reasonable
comments in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority
with respect to obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) consult with
the Other Party in advance of any meeting or teleconference with any
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the
Governmental Authority or other Person, give the Other Party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and teleconferences. Subject to
_Section 7.4(a)_ , the Parties will take reasonable efforts to share
information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant
to this _Section 7.1_ in a manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Party is required to disclose to the Other Party its documents responsive to
Items 4(c) and 4(d) of the HSR Notification and Report Form.

 \t\t\t\t

(d) In furtherance of the covenants set forth in this _Section 7.1_ and
subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 7.1(d)_ , if any
objections are asserted with respect to the Merger under any Antitrust Law or
if any lawsuit or other proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the Federal Trade Commission,
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other Governmental
Authority challenging the Merger or which would otherwise prohibit or
materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger, each of Parent and
the Company shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to) take all
actions necessary to resolve any such objections or lawsuits or other
proceedings (or threatened lawsuits or other proceedings) so as to permit
consummation of the Merger as soon as reasonably practicable, including
becoming subject to, consenting to or agreeing to, or otherwise taking any
action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement
or order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct,
restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change its respective assets or
business (including that of its Affiliates) (each, a " _ **Divestiture**_ _
**Action**_ "); _provided_ that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any such action that would reasonably
be expected to impair the benefits of the Merger to Parent or to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the obligations of the parties under this
_Section 7.1(d)_ to consummate any such Divestiture Action shall be
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing or satisfaction of all of the
conditions to the Closing in a case where the Closing will occur immediately
following such Divestiture Action.

 \t\t\t\t

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section 7.1_ (but subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 7.1(d)_ ), if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any proceeding by a private Person, is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging the Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, each
of Parent and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger.

 \t\t\t\t

 **7.2 ** ** _Registration Statement; Proxy Statement_**.

 \t\t\t\t

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
and Parent will prepare and the Company will file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement and the Company and Parent will prepare and Parent will file with
the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. The Parties shall file, if necessary, any other
statement or schedule relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated

 \t\t\t\t

hereby. Each of the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to furnish the information required to be included by the SEC in
the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement and any such statement or
schedule. Each of the Company and Parent will use its reasonable best efforts
to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing and keep the Registration
Statement effective for so long as necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent also agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities
Act. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement
will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or
dissemination to the Company Stockholders of, the Proxy Statement or any other
materials used in connection with the Company Meeting that constitute "proxy
materials" or "solicitation materials" as those terms are used in Rules 14a-1
through 14a-17 under the Exchange Act or are otherwise used for the
"solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 under the
Exchange Act (" _ **Other Proxy Materials**_ ") will be made by the Company
without providing the Other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon (and good faith consideration by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, of all such comments). If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information will promptly notify the Other Party hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information will be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the Company
Stockholders. The Parties will notify each other promptly of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the
SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement or for additional information and each
Party will supply the Other Party with copies of (i) all correspondence
between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) all
orders of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement; _provided_ that no
responses to any oral or written request by the SEC with respect to the
Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or the Other Proxy Materials, will
be made by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without providing the Other
Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (and good faith
consideration by Parent or the Company, as applicable, of all such comments).

 \t\t\t\t

(b) Unless this Agreement has been validly terminated as provided in _Section
9.1_ prior thereto, the Company will, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, establish a record date for, and as soon
as reasonably practicable following the Registration Statement being declared
effective by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, the Company
Meeting. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this
Agreement by the Company Stockholders and an advisory vote on compensation
payable to executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger
(together with related procedural matters) shall be the only proposals to be
submitted to, or voted on by, the Company Stockholders at the Company Meeting.
Subject to _Section 7.3_ , the Company will, through the Company Board,
recommend to the Company Stockholders that they adopt this Agreement (the " _
**Company Board Recommendation**_ "). The Proxy Statement shall (subject to
_Section 7.3_ ) include the Company Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not postpone or
adjourn the Company Meeting without the consent of Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), other than (i) to solicit additional
proxies for the purpose of obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) in the
absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing
and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company
Board has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is
necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure
to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company Stockholders prior to the
Company Meeting, and (iv) if the Company has delivered any notice contemplated
by _Section 7.3(e)_ or _Section 7.3(f)_ and the time periods contemplated by
_Section 7.3(e)_ or _Section 7.3(f)_ have not expired to extend the date of
the Company Meeting beyond the end of such period.

 \t\t\t\t

 **7.3 ** ** _Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation_**. 

 \t\t\t\t

(a) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore

with respect to any possible Alternative Proposal, and request that each
Person who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with such Persons consideration of any Alternative Proposal return or destroy
all confidential information previously provided to such Person by or on
behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Except as permitted by this
_Section 7.3_ , the Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by
way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the making or the submission
of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
an Alternative Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or data relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Person that
has made an Alternative Proposal or to any Person in contemplation of an
Alternative Proposal (other than, solely in response to an unsolicited
inquiry, to refer the inquiring Person to this _Section 7.3_ and to limit its
conversation or other communication exclusively to such referral), (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, endorse or
recommend) any Alternative Proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent,
term sheet, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, exchange agreement or any other agreement providing for with
respect to an Alternative Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, (v) subject to the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board, amend or grant any waiver, release or modification under, or
fail to enforce, any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class
of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (vi) resolve
or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any of the Companys Subsidiaries or by any Representatives of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Representative is
so authorized and whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 \t\t\t\t

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 7.3_ ,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company has received a written
Alternative Proposal that the Company Board believes in good faith is _bona
fide_ , (ii) the Company Board, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such Alternative
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a
Superior Proposal, and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to participate in such negotiations or discussions or to furnish such
information or data to such Third Party would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may, subject
to clauses (w)-(z) below, (A) furnish information, including confidential
information, with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that (w) such
Alternative Proposal was received after the date of this Agreement, such
Alternative Proposal was not initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated
in violation of _Section 7.3(a)_ and such Alternative Proposal has not been
withdrawn, (x) the Company provides to Parent the notice required by _Section
7.3(c)_ with respect to such Alternative Proposal, (y) the Company will not,
and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers and employees not to, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective other Representatives not to, disclose any non-public
information to such Person unless the Company has, or first enters into, a
confidentiality agreement with such Person with confidentiality provisions
that are not materially less restrictive to such Person than the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent, a copy of which shall be promptly
provided to Parent (it being agreed that such confidentiality agreement
between the Company and such person shall permit such person to make any non-
public Alternative Proposal to the Company Board) and (z) prior to or
substantially concurrently with providing or making available to such other
Person any non-public information about the Company and its Subsidiaries that
was not previously provided or made available to Parent, the Company will
provide such non-public information to Parent. If Parent or the Company
believes that there has been a breach by a Third Party (or its
Representatives) of any standstill provisions to which such Third Party and
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or Parent or the Company
reasonably anticipates such a breach, then upon written request by Parent, the
Company, subject to the fiduciary duties of the Company Board, shall take all
necessary actions to enforce such standstill provision.

 \t\t\t\t

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in this _Section
7.3_ , the Company will promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal or any inquiry or request for
discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Proposal or non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with an Alternative Proposal advise Parent orally and in writing of such
Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request (including providing the identity of
the person making or submitting such

Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request and, (x) if it is in writing, a copy
of such Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request and any related draft
agreements and (y) if oral, a reasonably detailed summary thereof) (and any
changes thereto). The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed of material
developments with respect to any such Alternative Proposal (and in no event
later than twenty-four (24) hours following any such development).

 \t\t\t\t

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.3_ , neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof will directly or indirectly: (i) withhold,
withdraw, modify, qualify or fail to make, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, modify, qualify or fail to make, in any manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation, including by failing to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and Registration Statement, (ii)
publicly approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (iii) approve, adopt or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
or other similar contract or any tender or exchange offer providing for, with
respect to, or in connection with, any Alternative Proposal, (iv) approve any
transaction under, or any Third Party becoming, an "interested stockholder"
under, Section 203 of the DGCL (or similar concepts under any other applicable
Takeover Law), or (v) resolve, propose, agree or publicly announce an
intention to do any of the foregoing (any action described in this _Section
7.3(d)_ being referred to as a " _ **Change in Recommendation**_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, a public statement that merely describes the Companys
receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with
respect thereto shall not be deemed a Change in Recommendation.

 \t\t\t\t

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company receives a written
Alternative Proposal that the Company Board believes in good faith is _bona
fide_ and such Alternative Proposal was not initiated, solicited, encouraged
or facilitated in violation of _Section 7.3(a)_ and the Company Board (i)
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
concludes that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(ii) following consultation with outside legal counsel, determines that the
failure of the Company Board to make a Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
Board may at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ and pay Parent a
Termination Fee and/or effect a Change in Recommendation ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such termination shall not be effective unless and until the
Company shall have paid the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section
9.4(c)_ ); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not take such
action pursuant to the foregoing unless:

 \t\t\t\t

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice (which notice must state
that the Company Board has made the determinations contemplated by the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 7.3(d)_ ) to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a description of the
material terms of such Superior Proposal, identifying the Person or group
making such Superior Proposal and delivering to Parent a copy of the proposed
definitive agreement providing for the Alternative Proposal for such Superior
Proposal in the form to be entered into and any other relevant proposed
transaction agreements) at least four calendar days in advance of its
intention to take such action with respect to a Change in Recommendation (the
period inclusive of all such days, the " _ **Notice Period**_ ") (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to the terms of a Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice pursuant to this _Section 7.3(e)_ and a
new Notice Period, except that such new Notice Period in connection with any
amendment shall be for three calendar days from the time Parent receives such
notice (as opposed to four calendar days));

 \t\t\t\t

(ii) during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

 \t\t\t\t

(iii) at the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board again concludes in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, and taking into account any adjustment or modification to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent, that such Alternative
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure of
the Company Board to effect a Change in Recommendation or to terminate this
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 \t\t\t\t

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation
pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ , the Company shall not be entitled to enter
into any agreement, including any definitive acquisition agreement, with
respect to a Superior Proposal unless and until (i) this Agreement is
terminated and (ii) if applicable, the Termination Fee has been paid to Parent
pursuant to _Section 9.4_.

 \t\t\t\t

(f) Other than in connection with an Alternative Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section 7.3(e)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section 7.3(f)_
), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board from
making a Change in Recommendation prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval in response to an Intervening Event to the extent that (i) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to effect a
Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and (ii) (A) the Company provides Parent four calendar days
written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify the reasons therefor, (B) after providing such notice and prior to
making such Change in Recommendation, the Company shall negotiate in good
faith with Parent during such four calendar day period (to the extent that
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as would not permit the Company Board to make a Change in
Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 7.3(f)_ , and (C) the Company Board
shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in
writing by Parent, and following such four calendar day period, shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that the Company Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law would continue to require a Change in Recommendation with
respect to such Intervening Event.

 \t\t\t\t

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Company Stockholders) or
from making any legally required disclosure to Company Stockholders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure that addresses or relates to
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company
Board with respect to this Agreement or an Alternative Proposal shall be
deemed to be a Change in Recommendation unless the Company Board in connection
with such communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect
to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the
Company Board. Any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the Company or the
Company Board to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the

consummation, of such Alternative Proposal.

 \t\t\t\t

 **7.4 ** ** _Access to Information; Confidentiality_**. 

 \t\t\t\t

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to the Other Party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to (and, with respect to books and
records, the right to copy) all of its and its Subsidiaries properties
(including for purposes of environmental assessment, which may include
subsurface or other invasive testing or sampling only upon the Companys prior
written approval), commitments, books, contracts, records and correspondence
(in each case, whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives. Without
limiting the foregoing, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the
Company shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, and provide Parent and its
Representatives continued access to, the Data Site, and shall not remove any
documents or information loaded onto the Data Site prior to, on or after the
date hereof. The Company shall not remove any of the documents or items
provided in the Data Site through and including the Closing Date. Each Party
shall furnish promptly to the Other Party (i) a copy of each report, schedule
and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including
"comment letters") received by such Party from the SEC concerning compliance
with securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries businesses, properties and personnel as the Other Party may
reasonably request (including information necessary to prepare the Proxy
Statement and the Registration Statement. Except for disclosures permitted by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, each Party and its Representatives
shall hold information received from the Other Party pursuant to this _Section
7.4_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 \t\t\t\t

(b) This _Section 7.4_ shall not require either Party to permit any access, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of such Party
(i) would reasonably be expected to result in any violation of any contract or
Law to which such Party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause
any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such Party or any of
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information and such undermining of such privilege could in such Partys
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such Partys position in any
pending or, what such Party believes in good faith (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future litigation or (ii) is
reasonably pertinent to any litigation, if any, in which such Party or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Other Party or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of clause (i) above, the Parties hereto shall cooperate
in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by
entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (1)
would not (in the good faith belief of the Party being requested to disclose
the information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such contract
or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with
respect to such information or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief
of the Party being requested to disclose the information (after consultation
with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee
Representatives of the Other Party shall be provided access to such
information. In addition, the Party being requested to disclose the
information shall (x) notify the Other Party that such disclosures are
reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under any
such contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined, (y) communicate to the Other Party in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to such

notification and the subject matter of such information (to the extent it is
able to do so in accordance with the first proviso in this _Section 7.4(b)_ )
and (z) in the case where such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate
its or its Subsidiaries obligations under any contract, use reasonable
commercial efforts to seek consent from the applicable Third Party to any such
contract with respect to the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not
otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of such contract).

 \t\t\t\t

 **7.5 ** ** _Public Statements_**. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company
will not, and each will cause its respective Representatives not to, issue any
public announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written approval of
the Other Party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a Party or its Representatives may
issue a public announcement or other public disclosures required by Law or the
rules of any stock exchange upon which such Partys equity securities are
traded, _provided_ that such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the
Other Party an opportunity to first review the content of the proposed
disclosure and provide reasonable comment regarding same, (b) the Company
shall not be required by this _Section 7.5_ to consult with Parent or any
other Person with respect to a public announcement in connection with the
receipt and existence of an Alternative Proposal and matters related thereto

presentations are not materially inconsistent with public statements or
presentations previously approved by the other Party.

 \t\t\t\t

 **7.6 ** ** _Confidentiality_**. The obligations of Parent and the
Company under the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and all information provided to any Party hereto or its Representatives
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed to be "Evaluation
Material" as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to
restrict the performance by the Company or Parent of their respective
obligations under this Agreement and, in the case of any conflict between the
terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the
terms of this Agreement shall control.

 \t\t\t\t

 **7.7 ** ** _Takeover Laws_**. Neither the Company nor Parent will take
any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each of them will
take all reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from
the Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 \t\t\t\t

 **7.8 ** ** _New Common Shares Listed_**. Parent will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to list, prior to the Effective Time, on the
NYSE, upon official notice of issuance, the New Common Shares.

 \t\t\t\t

 **7.9 ** ** _Third-Party Approvals_**.

 \t\t\t\t

Company and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to prepare all documentation, to

authorizations of all Governmental Authorities and Third Parties necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with
the terms and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations and to cause the Merger to be consummated as expeditiously as
practicable. Each of Parent and the Company has the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in
each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to, all material written information submitted to any Third Party
or any Governmental Authorities in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
Parties agrees to act reasonably and promptly. Each Party agrees that it will
consult with the Other Party with respect to the obtaining of all material
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all Third Parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party will keep the Other Party
apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 \t\t\t\t

Party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,

 **7.10 ** ** _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_**.

 \t\t\t\t

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, the
Director and Officer Indemnification Agreements, this Agreement or, if
applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
jointly and severally, will: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Person who
is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the Effective Time, (A) an
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) a
director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request or for
the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, together with such
Persons heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators
(collectively, the " _ **Indemnified Parties**_ ") to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by applicable Law from and against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any
thereof) arising out of or in connection with any Claim or Action; and (ii)
promptly pay on behalf of or, within fifteen (15) days after any request for
advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification
Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or
otherwise participating with respect to any Claim or Action in advance of the
final disposition of such Claim or Action, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification Expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect
to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the
requirement of any bond or other security; _provided_ , _however_ , that it
shall be a condition to the payment or advancement of any Indemnification
Expenses that Parent or the Surviving Corporation receive an undertaking by
the Indemnified Party to repay such Indemnification Expenses paid or advanced
if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified under applicable Law. The indemnification and advancement
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Section
7.10(a)_ extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time
in the capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Claim or Action relating thereto (including with respect
to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the
process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim or Action relating
thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses
conferred hereunder continue as to any Indemnified Party who has ceased to be
a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date
hereof (with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such cessation)
and inure to the benefit of such Indemnified Partys heirs, executors and
personal and legal representatives. As used in this _Section 7.10_ : (x) the
term " _ **Claim**_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed
action or proceeding, whether instituted by any Party, any Governmental
Authority or any other person, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute
resolution mechanism (" _ **Action**_ ") arising out of or pertaining to
matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or service as a
director or officer of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries or as a
trustee of (or in a similar capacity with) any compensation and benefit plan
of any thereof; (y) the term " _ **Indemnification Expenses**_ " means
reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and
obligations (including reasonable experts fees, travel expenses, court costs,
retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well
as reasonable telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or
incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or
participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is
sought pursuant to this _Section 7.10(a)_ , including any Action relating to a
claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party; and
(z) the phrase "to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable
Law" includes, but is not limited to (1) to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by any provision of the DGCL that authorizes or permits additional
indemnification by agreement or otherwise, or the corresponding provision of
any amendment to or replacement of the DGCL: and (2) to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL
adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which an
entity may

 \t\t\t\t

indemnify its directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries
or persons serving in any capacity in which any Indemnified Party serves. To
the extent permitted by Law, any amendment, alteration or repeal of the DGCL
that adversely affects any right of any Indemnified Party will be prospective
only and does not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim
or Action involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal. Neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Claim or Action in respect
of which indemnification has been or would reasonably be expected to be sought
by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or
judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Claim or Action without admission or finding of
wrongdoing, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any
settlement effected without either Parents or the Surviving Corporations
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a
plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties
in any jurisdiction with respect to any single such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, unless the use of one counsel for such
Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest
that would make such joint representation inappropriate. In the event of any
such Action, each applicable Indemnified Party, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof.

 \t\t\t\t

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the Company Charter
and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership
agreement, limited liability company agreement, or other organizational
documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries) and the Director and Officer
Indemnification Agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at
the Effective Time and will survive the Merger and continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms.

 \t\t\t\t

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the organizational
documents of the Companys Subsidiaries will contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses,
exculpation and limitations on liability of directors and officers than are
set forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, which provisions will not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by Law and then only
to the minimum extent required by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
modification shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any
such right with respect to any Claim or Action involving any occurrence or
alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to
modification; and _provided_ _further_ that all rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any
Claim made within such period continue until the disposition of such Action or
resolution of such Claim.

 \t\t\t\t

(d) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation will maintain in effect the current directors and
officers liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering the
Indemnified Parties (but may substitute therefor other policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Parties so long as that substitution does not
result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to matters occurring on or
before the Effective Time. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will
be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual
premiums paid therefor prior to the date hereof and will purchase the maximum
amount of coverage that can be obtained for that amount if the coverage
described in this _Section 7.10(d)_ would cost in excess of that amount.

 \t\t\t\t

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or
into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers
or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable,
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.10_.

 \t\t\t\t

(f) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and, from and after the Second
Step Merger, the Surviving Company, to perform all of the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.10_.

(g) This _Section 7.10_ survives the consummation of the Merger and the Second
Step Merger and is intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable
by, the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnitees and their respective heirs and
personal representatives, and will be binding on the Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Company and their respective successors and assigns.

 \t\t\t\t

 **7.11 ** ** _Notification of Certain Matters_**. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
to the extent in each case it obtains Knowledge thereof, of: (i) any notice or
other communication received by such Party or its Subsidiaries from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain
such consent is reasonably likely to be material to the Company, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or to materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries and
that relate to the Merger; (iii) any inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of the Company or Parent, as applicable, contained herein at any time
during the term hereof; (iv) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that,
or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the
conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_ ; and (v) any material failure of
such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereby which would result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_. In the
case of clauses (iii), (iv) and (v), however, the failure to comply with this
_Section 7.11_ shall not result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the
conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_ , or give rise to any right to
terminate this Agreement under _Article IX_ , if the underlying fact,
circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself give rise to such
failure or right.

 \t\t\t\t

 **7.12 ** ** _Section 16 Matters_**. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company will take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Shares)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to the Surviving Corporation, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 \t\t\t\t

 **7.13 ** ** _Employee Benefits_**. 

 \t\t\t\t

(a) From the Effective Time through December 31, 2017, Parent will, or will
cause its Affiliates to, provide each of the Employees who remains in the
active employment of Parent or any of its Affiliates following the Effective
Time (the " _ **Continuing Employees**_ ") with (i) a base salary or wages
that are no less than such Continuing Employees base salary or wages as of
the Effective Time, and (ii) a target bonus opportunity that is no less
favorable than the opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee as of the
Effective Time.

 \t\t\t\t

(b) Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to, honor all obligations under
each Company Employee Benefit Plan listed on _Section 5.19(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule that remains in effect after the Effective Time, including
any rights or benefits arising as a result of the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event,
including termination of employment), and Parent hereby agrees and
acknowledges that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement constitutes a "change of control" or a "change in control" or
similar term, as the case may be, for all purposes under each Company Employee
Benefit Plan.

 \t\t\t\t

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause its
Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each material
Parent Employee Benefit Plan (including all applicable vacation, severance and
defined contribution retirement benefit plans and programs) in which any
Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate to treat the prior service
of such Continuing Employee with any of the Company and its Affiliates as
service rendered to Parent for all purposes (including vesting, eligibility,
level of benefit and benefit accrual purposes, but other than for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or vesting under any equity
compensation plan) to the extent that such service crediting does not violate
any applicable Law or result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

 \t\t\t\t

(d) Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health and welfare coverage of any
Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents due to pre-existing

of Parent to the extent such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible
dependents are covered under a health and welfare benefit plan of the Company
or any of its Affiliates (as the case may be), and such conditions, periods or
requirements are satisfied or waived under such plan, immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) credit each Continuing Employee and his or her
eligible dependents with all deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance
paid by such employee and covered dependents under the medical employee
benefit plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates (as the case may be)
prior to the Effective Time during the year in which the Effective Time occurs
for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such employee and his
or her dependents have satisfied their deductible and whether they have
reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any medical plan of Parent or any
Affiliate of Parent for such year.

 \t\t\t\t

(e) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid
time off to which each Continuing Employee is entitled during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will, or will cause its
Affiliates to, assume and honor all vacation and other paid time off days
accrued or earned but not yet taken by such Continuing Employee as of the
Effective Time to the extent reflected on the Companys books and records.

 \t\t\t\t

(f) To the extent requested by Parent, the Company or its appropriate
Affiliate shall execute and deliver such instruments and take such other
actions as Parent may reasonably require in order to cause the amendment,
termination and/or liquidation of any Company Employee Benefit Plan, on terms
that are in accordance with the applicable amendment, termination and/or

 **9.3 ** ** _Effect of Termination_**. In the event that this Agreement
is validly terminated as provided in _Section 9.1_ , then each of the Parties
will be relieved of its duties and obligations arising under this Agreement
after the date of such termination and such termination will be without
liability to Parent or the Company; _provided_ , that the agreements and
obligations of the Parties set forth in this _Section 9.3_ , _Section 9.4_ and
_Article X_ hereof will survive and remain fully enforceable. In addition,
nothing in this _Section 9.3_ relieves any of Parent or the Company of any
liability for fraud or any Willful Breach of any covenant or agreement
contained herein occurring prior to termination, or as provided in the
Confidentiality Agreement. In the event of fraud or a Willful Breach, the
aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law
or in equity. " _ **Willful Breach**_ " means an intentional and willful
material breach, or an intentional and willful material failure to perform, in
each case that is the consequence of an act or omission by a Party with the
knowledge that the taking of, or failure to take, such act would, or would be
reasonably expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement.

 \t\t\t\t

 **9.4 ** ** _Fees and Expenses_**. 

 \t\t\t\t

(a) In the event that (i) an Alternative Proposal is publicly proposed or
publicly disclosed prior to, and not publicly withdrawn at the time of, the
date of the Company Meeting (or, if the Company Meeting has not occurred,
prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ or
_Section 9.1(e)_ ) and (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ , _Section 9.1(e)_ or _Section 9.1(f)_ and
(iii) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, an Alternative Proposal within twelve (12) months after the date
this Agreement is terminated, then the Company will pay to Parent the
Termination Fee, upon the earlier of (x) the date of the execution of such
definitive agreement by the Company (or, if such date is not a Business Day,
then the first Business Day following such date) and (y) the date of the
consummation of any such transaction. For purposes of this _Section 9.4(a)_ ,
the term " _ **Alternative Proposal**_ " has the meaning assigned to such term
in _Section 7.3(h)(i)_ , except that the references to "20% or more" are
deemed to be references to "more than 50%."

 \t\t\t\t

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.1(g)_ , then the Company will pay to Parent, within two (2) Business Days
after the date of termination, the Termination Fee.

 \t\t\t\t

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(h)_ , then the Company will pay to Parent, immediately prior to

made in cash by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent.

 \t\t\t\t

(e) Each Party will pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering
into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ that Parent will pay 100% of the filing fees
payable in connection with the filings required to be made under the HSR Act.

 \t\t\t\t

(f) The Company acknowledges that the provisions of this _Section 9.4_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company fails promptly to pay or cause to be paid the amounts due pursuant to
this _Section 9.4_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger
Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in this _Section 9.4_ , the Company shall pay to Parent and
Merger Sub (as the case may be) its reasonable costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal
relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this
_Section 9.4_ at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made. The Parties agree that in the event that the
Company pays the Termination Fee to Parent, the Company has no further
liability to Parent of any kind in respect of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby ( _provided_ that nothing herein shall
release any party from liability for Willful Breach or fraud), and that in no
event will the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

 \t\t\t\t

(g) As used herein, " _ **Termination Fee**_ " means a cash amount equal to
eighty seven million dollars ($87,000,000).

delivered by hand or overnight courier service or (ii) upon receipt of an
appropriate electronic answerback or confirmation when so delivered by fax (to
such number specified above or another number or numbers as such Person may
subsequently designate by notice given hereunder).

 \t\t\t\t

 **10.5 ** ** _Assignment_**. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by either Party without the prior
written consent of the Other Party; _provided_ __ that no such assignment will
relieve any Party of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this _Section 10.5_ shall be null and void.

 \t\t\t\t

 **10.6 ** ** _Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_**.
This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the
entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to the matters
therein and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings on such
matters. The provisions of this Agreement are binding upon, inure to the
benefit of the Parties hereto and, subject to _Section 10.5_ , their
respective successors and assigns. No provision of this Agreement is intended
to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns and, except as provided in _Section 7.10_ (which will be to the
benefit of the Persons referred to in such Section).

 \t\t\t\t

 **10.7 ** ** _Severability_**. Any provision of this Agreement which is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions
hereof in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this
Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

 \t\t\t\t

 **10.8 ** ** _Jurisdiction_**. 

 \t\t\t\t

(a) The Parties hereto agree that any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be heard and
determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex
Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that
is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the
federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of the
United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware), and any
appellate court from any thereof, and each of them irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives the defense of an inconvenient forum and all
other defenses to venue in any such court in any such action or proceeding.
The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this _Section 10.8_ shall
not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties.
The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ ,

that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Partys rights to seek any
post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court
judgment. The Parties agree that process in any such action or proceeding may
be served by registered mail or in any other manner permitted by the rules of
the court in which the action or proceeding is brought.

 \t\t\t\t

 **10.9 ** ** _Waiver of Jury Trial_**. To the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law that cannot be waived, each Party hereby irrevocably waives and
covenants that it will not assert (whether as plaintiff, defendant or
otherwise) any right to trial by jury in any forum in respect of any issue,
claim, demand, action or cause of action arising in whole or in part under,
related to, based on, or in connection with, this Agreement or the subject
matter hereof, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether sounding
in tort or contract or otherwise. Any Party may file an original counterpart
or a copy of this _Section 10.9_ with any court as written evidence of the
consent of each such Party to the waiver of its right to trial by jury.

 \t\t\t\t

 **10.10 ** ** _No Recourse_**. This Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly
identified as parties hereto and no past, present or future Affiliate,
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner,
stockholder, agent, attorney or other representative of any Party hereto has
any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Parties to this
Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 \t\t\t\t

 **10.11 ** ** _Specific Performance_**. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in
each case, in accordance with this _Section 10.11_ in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any
other court of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by law, in a
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that
(x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each
party further agrees that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.11_ , and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 \t\t\t\t

 **10.12 ** ** _Survival_**. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, none of the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants
contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing or the termination of
this Agreement if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing occurs, the agreements of the
parties in _Sections 3.3_ , _3.4_ , _3.5_ , _7.10_ , _7.13_ , _7.14_ and this
_Article X_ will survive the Closing, and if this Agreement is terminated
prior to the Closing, the agreements of the parties in _Sections 7.6_ , _9.2_
, _9.3_ and _9.4_ , and this _Article X_ will survive such termination. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the Effective Time.
