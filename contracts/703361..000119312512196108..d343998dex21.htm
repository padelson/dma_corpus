AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 30, 2012 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among Integrated Device Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _Parent_ "), Pinewood Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Purchaser_ "), Pinewood Merger Sub,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Merger LLC_ ") and PLX Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "). All capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have
the meanings assigned to such terms in _Section 8.4_ or as otherwise defined
elsewhere in this Agreement, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchaser has agreed to commence an
exchange offer (the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Shares_ "), in
exchange for consideration, per Share, comprised of (i) $3.50 in cash _plus_
(ii) 0.525 of a share of Parent Common Stock (the " _Per Share Exchange Ratio_
") (such consideration or any different consideration per Share that may be
paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer
Price_ "), without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law;

WHEREAS, following the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_ "), in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "
_DGCL_ "), whereby each issued and outstanding Share (other than Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) will be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest, subject
to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law;

WHEREAS, the parties intend that, subject to _Section 6.2_, the Merger shall
be immediately followed by a merger of the Surviving Corporation (as defined
below) with and into Merger LLC (the " _Second Merger_ " and, together with
the Merger, the " _Mergers_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability Company
Act;

WHEREAS, it is intended that, if the Second Merger is effected, the Offer,
the Merger and the Second Merger, taken together, shall be considered a single
integrated transaction for United States federal income Tax purposes and shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code (as defined below);

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously (i)
determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Offer and the Mergers, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Mergers and
(iii) recommended that the CompanyÂ’s stockholders accept the Offer, tender
their Shares to the Purchaser in the Offer and, to the extent applicable,
approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ");

 



1 WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and the Purchaser have, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously (i)
determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Offer and the Mergers, are fair to and in the best interests of Parent and the
Purchaser and their respective stockholders and (ii) approved, adopted and
declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Mergers;

WHEREAS, as a condition to and inducement of ParentÂ’s and the PurchaserÂ’s
willingness to enter into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution of
this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have executed and
delivered to Parent and the Purchaser a Tender and Support Agreement (the "
_Tender Agreement_ "), dated as of the date hereof, pursuant to which such
stockholders have, among other matters, agreed to (i) tender the Shares
beneficially owned by them in the Offer and (ii) support the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, each on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Tender Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, Parent, the Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Mergers and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer
and the Mergers;

AGREEMENT 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, as such period may be extended if and to the
extent the Company fails to satisfy its obligations pursuant to _Section
1.1(h)_ or other information required from Representatives of the Company or
Parent is delayed), the Purchaser shall commence, within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer to purchase all the outstanding
Shares at the Offer Price. The consummation of the Offer, and the obligation
of the Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer, shall be subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer
and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of Shares
which, together with the number of Shares (if any) then owned by Parent or any
of its wholly-owned direct or indirect 

 



2  Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser, or with respect to which Parent or
any of its wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries, including the
Purchaser, otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power,
represents at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding (determined on a
fully diluted basis) and no less than a majority of the voting power of the
shares of capital stock of the Company then outstanding (determined on
a fully diluted basis) and entitled to vote upon the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger (excluding from the number of tendered
Shares, but not from the number of outstanding Shares, Shares tendered
pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered
in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee) (collectively, the " _Minimum
Condition_ ") and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by the Purchaser (to the
extent permitted in _Annex I_ ), of the other conditions and requirements set
forth in _Annex I_. Subject to this _Section 1.1_ and _Annex I_ , the
conditions and requirements to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ are for the
sole benefit of the Purchaser and may be asserted by the Purchaser regardless
of the circumstances giving rise to such condition or may be waived by the
Purchaser, in its sole discretion, in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time.

 

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction,
or waiver by the Purchaser (to the extent permitted by  _Annex I_ ), of the
other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ , the Purchaser
shall, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, accept for exchange and
exchange all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer as promptly as practicable and in any event not more than two
Business Days after the first Expiration Date upon which such conditions are
satisfied or waived. The Offer Price to be exchanged in respect of each Share
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
exchanged, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law. To the extent any such amounts are so withheld, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. No fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Offer, no
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any such fractional share interest and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of any such
fractional share, each holder of Shares who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in
lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holderÂ’s Shares,
be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a
share of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ on the date the Acceptance Time
occurs.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer
to Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_. The Purchaser expressly
reserves the right to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes
in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as previously approved by the
Company in writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price,
(ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer (other than adding
consideration), (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in
the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition or the conditions set
forth in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of _Annex I_ , (v) add to or amend any of
the other

 



3  conditions and requirements to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ in a manner
that is material and adverse to the holders of Shares, (vi) except as provided
in _Section 1.1(e)_, extend the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend the Offer in
any manner that is material and adverse to the holder of Shares.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Offer Price
(including the Per Share Exchange Ratio) shall be adjusted appropriately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into, as
applicable, Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock), cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the Shares or shares
of Parent Common Stock, occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall
provide to the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ that nothing in this sentence
shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to
its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall initially expire at midnight (New York City time) on the later of (i)
date that is 20 Business Days (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act) following the commencement of the Offer (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) and (ii) one Business Day after
the No-Shop Period Start Date (such date and time, the " _Initial Expiration
Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended as required by
or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement, the date and time to which the
Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date
and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance
with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

(e) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, any condition to
the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_ ) has not been satisfied, or, where
permitted by applicable Law and this Agreement, waived by the Purchaser, the
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) extend the Offer on
one or more occasions, for successive periods of up to 20 Business Days each,
until the satisfaction or, where permitted by applicable Law and
this Agreement, waiver by the Purchaser of each such condition. In addition,
the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) extend the Offer
for any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable rules,
regulations, interpretations or positions of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall not be required to extend
the Offer for any reason beyond October 30, 2012; _provided_ _however_ , that
if, as of such date, all conditions set forth in _Annex I_ have been satisfied
other than either (i) obtaining the Required Governmental Approval or (ii)
both obtaining the Required Governmental Approval and satisfying the Minimum
Condition, then (A) either Parent or the Company may, in its sole discretion
and pursuant to written notice to the other party no later than two
Business Days prior thereto and no earlier than five Business Days prior
thereto, extend such date for three months starting on October 31, 2012 and
ending on January 31, 2013 and (B) thereafter, Parent may, in its sole
discretion and pursuant to written notice to the Company no later than two
Business Days prior thereto and no earlier than five Business Days prior
thereto, extend such date for an additional three months starting on February
1, 2013 and ending on April 30, 2013 (thereafter, the last date of each such
additional three-

 



4  month period shall for all purposes of this Agreement be the " _Outside
Date_ ") solely to satisfy such condition(s); _provided_ _further_ that in no
event shall the Outside Date, if and as extended pursuant to this _Section
1.1(e)_ extend past April 30, 2013. Nothing in this _Section 1.1(e)_ shall be
deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of
Parent or the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article 7_
hereof.

(f) If necessary to obtain sufficient Shares to reach the Short Form
Threshold (without regard to the exercise of the Top-Up Option, but subject to
the PurchaserÂ’s obligations under _Section 1.7(b)_), the Purchaser may, in
its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or
more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act; _provided_ , that, the Purchaser has complied with its obligations to
accept for exchange and exchange tendered Shares in accordance with _Section
1.1(b)_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer,
the Purchaser shall immediately accept for exchange and exchange all Shares
that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent
offering period." The Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a
"subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this
_Section 1.1(f)_.

 

(g) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 7_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article 7_ , the Purchaser shall promptly (and in any
event within 48 hours of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn
by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the exchange of
Shares in the Offer, the Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depositary acting on behalf of the Purchaser to return, in accordance with
applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer, the
Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ "), which shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase, a
form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary advertisement and (ii)
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (or similar successor
form) to register the offer and sale of the Parent Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer and the Merger (including amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Registration Statement_ "), which Registration Statement shall include a
preliminary prospectus containing the information required under Rule 14d-4(b)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (collectively, together with any
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ").
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after the filing thereof with the SEC and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as necessary to complete the Offer
and the Merger. The Purchaser shall provide guaranteed delivery procedures for
the tender of Shares in the Offer. The Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent
required by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The Company shall
promptly furnish to Parent and the Purchaser in writing all information
concerning the Company that may be required by applicable securities Laws or
reasonably requested by Parent or the Purchaser for inclusion in the Offer
Documents. The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the

 



5  Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, and the Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC, and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel. In addition, the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that the Purchaser or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any
such written responses and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel.

 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) On the date of the filing of the Schedule TO with the SEC, the Company
shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to the
provisions of  _Section 5.4(c)_, contain the Company Board Recommendation.
The Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9, and represents that it
has obtained all necessary consents of the Company Financial Advisor to permit
the Company to include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness
Opinion, together with a summary thereof in accordance with Item 1015(b) of
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (regardless of whether such item is
applicable). The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of a description of the Company Board Recommendation. The Company
further agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. To the extent
requested by the Purchaser, the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders of Shares together with the
Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of Shares. The Company, on the one
hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent
that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as
otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange
Act. The Purchaser and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Purchaser and its counsel. In addition, the Company
shall provide the Purchaser and its counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly

 



6  after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.
The Purchaser and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review any such written responses and the Company shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Purchaser and its counsel.

(b) Promptly after the date hereof and otherwise from time to time as
requested by the Purchaser or its agents, the Company shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to the Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings,
non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files
containing the names and addresses of the record or beneficial holders of the
Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish the
Purchaser with such information (including updated lists of holders of the
Shares and their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and
non-objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as the
Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in communicating with the
record and beneficial holders of Shares. In addition, in connection with the
Offer, the Company shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any Third Parties to, cooperate with the Purchaser to disseminate the
Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to any Company
Employee Plan, and to permit such holders of Shares to tender Shares in the
Offer.

 

1.3 _Directors_.

(a) After the Purchaser accepts for exchange Shares tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer representing at least such number of Shares as
shall satisfy the Minimum Condition in accordance with the terms of the Offer
and this Agreement (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and at all times thereafter,
the Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is
equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to the directors elected or designated by the Purchaser
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the
aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and its direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser, bears to the
total number of Shares then outstanding. After the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall, upon the PurchaserÂ’s request, take all actions as are
necessary or desirable to enable the PurchaserÂ’s designees to be so elected or
designated to the Company Board, including promptly filling vacancies or newly
created directorships on the Company Board, promptly increasing the size of
the Company Board (including by amending the Company Bylaws if necessary to
increase the size of the Company Board) and/or promptly securing the
resignations of such number of its incumbent directors, and shall cause the
PurchaserÂ’s designees to be so elected or designated at such time (any and all
members of the Company Board immediately prior to any designees of the
Purchaser joining the Company Board and who remain on the Company Board after
any designees of the Purchaser join the Company Board, the " _Continuing
Directors_ "). After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall also, upon the
PurchaserÂ’s request, cause the directors elected or designated by the
Purchaser to the Company Board to serve on and constitute the same percentage
(rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each
committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body)
of each Company Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each
such board, in each case

 



7  to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the listing requirements of
NASDAQ. After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall also, upon the
PurchaserÂ’s request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a
"controlled company" as defined by NASDAQ Rule 4350(c) and make all necessary
filings and disclosures associated with such status. The provisions of this
_Section 1.3(a)_ are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that
Parent or its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser, may
have as a record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of
applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. 

(b) The CompanyÂ’s obligations to appoint the PurchaserÂ’s designees to the
Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions
required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 1.3_, including mailing to stockholders
(together with the Schedule 14D-9) any information required by Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1 to enable the PurchaserÂ’s designees to be elected or designated
to the Company Board at the time or times contemplated by this _Section
1.3_. The Purchaser shall supply or cause to be supplied to the Company any
information with respect to the Purchaser, its officers, directors and
Affiliates, and the proposed designees to the Company Board required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(c) In the event that the PurchaserÂ’s designees are elected or appointed to
the Company Board prior to the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_,
and without limiting _Section 1.3(a)_, the Company shall cause the Company
Board to have at least such number of directors as may be required by
the rules of the NASDAQ or the federal securities Laws who are considered
"independent directors" within the meaning of such Laws (" _Independent
Directors_ "); _provided_ , that in the event the number of
Independent Directors shall be reduced below the number as may be required by
such Laws for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s)
shall be entitled to designate Persons to fill such vacancies who shall be
deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no
other Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate
such number of directors as may be required by the rules of the NASDAQ or the
federal securities Laws, to fill such vacancies who shall not be stockholders
or Affiliates of Parent or the Purchaser, and such Persons shall be deemed to
be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event that the PurchaserÂ’s designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board prior to the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_, and
without limiting _Section 1.3(a)_, in addition to any approvals of the
Company Board or the stockholders of the Company as may be required by the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or applicable Law, the affirmative vote
of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required (i) for the
Company to terminate or amend this Agreement or any Promissory Note, (ii) for
the Company to exercise or waive any of the CompanyÂ’s rights, benefits or
remedies under this Agreement, or to agree to any extension of time for
performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or the Purchaser,
(iii) to authorize any Contract between the Company and of the
Company Subsidiaries, on one hand, and Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the other or (iv) to take any other action of the Company Board under or in
connection with this Agreement, in each case, if such termination, amendment,
exercise, waiver or other action would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect in any material

 



8  respect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser); _provided_ , _however_ , that if there
shall be no Continuing Directors as a result of such PersonsÂ’ deaths,
disabilities or resignations, then one or more persons who were directors or
officers of the Company as of the Acceptance Time shall be appointed as
Continuing Directors to the Company Board; _provided_   _further_ , that if
no such persons are willing to serve as Continuing Directors, such actions may
be effected by majority vote of the entire Company Board. The Continuing
Directors shall have, and the Purchaser and the Company Board shall take all
necessary action to cause the Continuing Directors to have, the authority to
retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and
other advisors at the expense of the Company, as determined by the Continuing
Directors, and the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company
to enforce performance of this Agreement.

1.4 _The Merger_.

and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, at the

generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property,

Surviving Corporation or by applicable Law. Subject to _Section 6.2_, at the
effective time of the Second Merger, the certificate of formation of the

(c) The directors of the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, become the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified,
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
officers of the

 



9  Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the

each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall
have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm
of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of
the Company or the Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to
carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company or the Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

 

1.5 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger; the Second Merger_.

 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on a date to be specified by the parties (the "
_Closing Date_ "), such date to be no later than the second Business Day after
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ , at
the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 140 Scott Drive, Menlo Park, California

appropriate certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the date and time the Certificate
of Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or such other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time, the " _Effective
Time_ ").

(b) Subject to _Section 6.2_, immediately after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall merge with and into Merger LLC. From and after the
effectiveness of the Second Merger, the separate corporate existence of the
Surviving Corporation shall cease and Merger LLC shall continue as the
surviving entity in the Second Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ ") and all of
the rights and obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement
shall be deemed the rights and obligations of the Surviving Company. The
Second Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 18-209(g) of the
Delaware Limited Liability Company Act.

 



10 1.6 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_.

 

Notwithstanding the terms of _Section 5.2_, if after the Acceptance Time and,
if applicable, the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by
the Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement and the exercise of the Top-Up
Option, the Purchaser holds at least 90% of the outstanding shares of each
class of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on the approval of
this Agreement under applicable Law (the " _Short Form Threshold_ "), the
parties hereto agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the
Merger to become effective as promptly as practicable without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company in accordance with the DGCL.

1.7 _Top-Up Option_. 

(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to the Purchaser a non-transferable,
non-assignable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable from and after
the Acceptance Time only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, to purchase from the Company, at a cash price per share equal to
the value of the Offer Price (with the value of the Per Share Exchange Ratio
calculated as the dollar amount determined by multiplying such ratio by the
closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ on the last trading
day prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option), an aggregate number of
newly-issued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ")
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Purchaser at the time
of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitute one share more than 90% of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the
issuance of all shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable
unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached
(assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) and all of the conditions
to the Merger would be satisfied or waived, as applicable; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a
number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the CompanyÂ’s then
total authorized and unissued Shares. Upon the PurchaserÂ’s request, the
Company shall cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to the Purchaser
the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares. The Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate par
value of the Top-Up Option Shares in cash and the balance of the aggregate
price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be paid by
delivery to the Company of a non-negotiable and non-transferable promissory
note (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The Promissory Note shall be full
recourse against the Purchaser, shall be guaranteed by Parent, shall bear
interest at the rate of interest per annum equal to the prime lending rate
prevailing from time to time during such period as published in The Wall
Street Journal, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of
execution and delivery of such Promissory Note and may be prepaid without
premium or penalty. Parent, the Purchaser and the

 



11  Company acknowledge and agree that, in any appraisal proceeding related to
this Agreement, the fair value of the Shares subject to the appraisal
proceeding shall be determined in accordance with the DGCL without regard to
the exercise by Parent or the Purchaser of the Top-Up Option, any Shares
issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option or the Promissory Note.

(b) Provided that no applicable Law shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or
otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, the Purchaser may exercise
the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part, after the Acceptance Time and
prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the valid
termination of this Agreement. If as of an Expiration Date (x) all the
conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ have been satisfied or
waived, as applicable, and (y) there shall have been validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn a sufficient number of Shares which, when added to the
number of shares (the " _Requisite Top-Up Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock
which could be owned by the Purchaser through exercise of the Top-Up Option,
constitute one share more than 90% of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option, the Purchaser shall
exercise the Top-Up Option with respect to the Requisite Top-Up Shares at such
time in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 1.7_.

(c) To exercise the Top-Up Option, the Purchaser shall send to the Company
a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ") specifying the aggregate
number of Shares as to which the Top-Up Option is being exercised, the
denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option
Shares that the Purchaser wishes to receive, and the place, time and date for
the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-Up Option (the "
_Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-Up
Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the Purchaser confirming the
number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor (the
" _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up Closing, the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange
for the Top-Up Option Shares in an aggregate amount equal to the purchase
price specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to
be issued and delivered to the Purchaser a certificate or certificates
representing the Top-Up Option Shares. Such certificates shall include any
legends that are required by applicable Law. The Purchaser acknowledges that
the Top-Up Option Shares shall not be registered under the Securities Act,
and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption for transactions not
involving a public offering. The Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option, and
the Top-Up Option Shares are being and shall be acquired by the Purchaser for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

 



12 ARTICLE 2

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_.

Subject to the terms hereof, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Purchaser, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law, upon surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_. 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company, and all Shares owned of record by
Parent or any of its direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, including
the Purchaser, shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, with
no payment being made in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued in connection with the Merger, no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent.
Any holder of Shares who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction
of a share and upon surrender of such holderÂ’s Company Stock Certificates,
be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent),
without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price
of a share of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ on the date the Merger becomes
effective.

 

(e) _Dividends; Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions declared
or made after the date hereof with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ will be paid to the holders of any
unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates shall
surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of
any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record
holders thereof, without any interest thereon (i) promptly after such
surrender, the Merger Consideration and the amount of any such dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock.

 



13 2.2 _Exchange and Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
designate a reputable bank or trust company to act as the Exchange Agent for
purposes of effecting the payment and distribution of the Merger Consideration
in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or promptly after
the Effective Time (and, in any event, on the Closing Date), the Purchaser
shall (i) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent
certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock sufficient to make all share issuances pursuant to this _ARTICLE 2_
and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, cash in
an amount sufficient to make all payments pursuant to this _ARTICLE 2_ , in
each case to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time
pursuant to this Agreement. Such funds, to the extent cash, shall be invested
by the Exchange Agent as directed by the Purchaser, in its sole discretion,
pending payment thereof by the Exchange Agent to the holders of the Shares.
Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of
the Purchaser, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of
holders of Shares.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, but in no event later than 5 Business Days thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the " _Certificates_
") or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_
"), in each case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form
and have such other provisions as the Purchaser or the Exchange Agent may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by the Purchaser, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal,
duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share and the
Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive within 5 Business Days. Any Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 



14  Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Agreement, without interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following six months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares of
Parent Common Stock or cash funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the
procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without interest and subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law. If, immediately prior to the
six year anniversary of the Effective Time (or otherwise immediately prior to
such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ to
receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts that Parent, the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the

 



15  holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to _Section 2.1(a)_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser may,
in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, stamp, documentary and similar Taxes
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein shall be the responsibility of the holders of the Shares, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and in respect of which appraisal rights shall have been
perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the
Merger (collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be converted into a
right to receive that portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to
the holder of such Dissenting Shares as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, but
shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of
the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares shall
receive payment therefor in accordance with the DGCL (but only after the
value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to
the DGCL). In the event that any holder of Company Common Stock fails to make
an effective demand for payment or fails to perfect its appraisal rights as
to its shares of Company Common Stock or any Dissenting Shares shall otherwise
lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in respect of such shares as if such shares had
never been Dissenting Shares, in accordance with and following the
satisfaction of the applicable requirements and conditions set forth in 
_Section 2.2_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and in no event
more than two Business Days) of (i) any demand received by the Company for
appraisal of Company Common Stock (and shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand) or (ii) any notice of exercise by any holder of Company Common Stock
of appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. The Company agrees that,
except with ParentÂ’s prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), it shall not voluntarily make any payment
or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for appraisal or exercise of appraisal rights.

2.4 _Treatment of Options and RSUs_.

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall assume each
outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Shares (each, a " _Company
Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, has an
exercise price per share less than

 



16  $9.00 and is held by an individual who, after the Effective Time, is an
"employee" of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent within the meaning of General
Instruction A(1)(a)(1) of Form S-8 (each, an " _Assumed Company Option_ ")
and each stock option plan of the Company or any other equity plan (each, a "
_Company Stock Option Plan_ ") pursuant to which any Assumed Company Option
has been granted. The Assumed Company Options shall be assumed in a manner
that is in compliance with Section 424 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder in the case of Company Options that are intended to be
"incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, and
in a manner that is in compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder in the case of Company Options that are non-
qualified stock options. Each Assumed Company Option shall thereafter be
exercisable, on substantially the same terms and conditions as in effect at
the Effective Time, for such number of shares of Parent Common Stock that
equals the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option as of the Effective Time multiplied by the Equity Exchange Ratio
(rounded down to the nearest whole number). The exercise price per share of
each such Assumed Company Option shall be equal to the exercise price per
share set forth at the Effective Time in the option agreement for such
Company Option divided by the Equity Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the next
whole cent). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Company Stock Option Plan(s) and all Assumed Company Options to be
assumed by Parent on the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section
2.4(a)_.

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option that is not
an Assumed Company Option shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each
former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to
receive from the Company, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company
Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash (subject to
all applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law) of an
amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of vested Shares
(including, in the case of holders of Company Options who cease to be
employees or other service providers immediately prior to the Effective Time
or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any Shares that become vested in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to such cancellation and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Option Cash-Out Consideration over the exercise price per Share subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to such cancellation (such amounts
payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Payments_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent
the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock that would
have been issuable upon exercise of such Company Option is greater than or
equal to the Per Share Option Cash-Out Consideration, the Company Option shall
be terminated and cancelled at the Effective Time and no Option Payment shall
be made. From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option
shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only
entitle such holder to the payment of the Option Payment, if any. The Option
Payments shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation as soon as
practicable (and in any event within 15 Business Days) following the Effective
Time, without interest. For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Option that
is unvested and is not an Assumed Company Option shall be cancelled as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time without payment of any Merger
Consideration or other amount with respect thereto or in settlement therefor,
and the Company shall take all necessary action to provide for such
cancellation and treatment.

 



17 (c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall assume each
restricted stock unit representing a right to receive a Share (each, a "
_Company RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is held by an individual who, after the Effective Time, is an "employee"
of Parent (as defined in _Section 2.4(a)_) (each, an " _Assumed RSU_ ").
Each Assumed RSU shall thereafter be subject to the same terms and conditions
as in effect at the Effective Time for such number of shares of Parent Common
Stock that equal the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company RSU as of the Effective Time multiplied by the Equity Exchange Ratio
and rounded down to the nearest whole share. Each Company RSU that is not an
Assumed RSU shall be terminated for no additional consideration effective as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take (or cause to be
taken) any and all action, and shall obtain all such consents, as may be
necessary to effect the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.4_, including
by amending the applicable Company Stock Options Plans as set forth on
_Section 2.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(e) Parent will cause Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
Assumed Company Options or upon settlement of the Assumed RSUs to be
registered with the SEC on Form S-8 as soon as practicable (and in any event
within 30 Business Days) following the Effective Time, will exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such Assumed Company Options and Assumed
RSUs remain outstanding and will maintain a sufficient number of reserved
shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance upon exercise or vesting, as
applicable, thereof.

is reasonably apparent from the text of such disclosure), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and the Purchaser as follows:

3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

") is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the applicable Law of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization and has all requisite corporate or
organizational, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and

conducted and as currently planned to be conducted. Each of the Company and
each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where any failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

Purchaser accurate and complete copies of the currently effective certificate
of incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Charter_ ") and bylaws of the

Company Subsidiary. The Company is not in violation of the Company Charter or
Company Bylaws, and the Company Subsidiaries are not in violation of their
respective organizational or governing documents.

(c) _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an
accurate and complete list of: (i) the Company Subsidiaries, together with
the jurisdiction of organization or incorporation, as the case may be, of each
Company Subsidiary, (ii) the jurisdictions in which the Company and each
Company Subsidiary is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or
other legal entity and (iii) the directors and officers of the Company and
each Company Subsidiary, as of the date of this Agreement.

 

3.2 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 200,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "
_Company Common Stock_ "), of which, as of the close of business on April 27,
2012, there were 44,743,245 shares issued and outstanding (excluding 26,543
shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury) and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_

issuance under any Contract. All of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

(b) As of the close of business on April 27, 2012, the Company has no shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock reserved for or otherwise

Stock subject to issuance under the Company Stock Option Plans, upon issuance
prior to the Effective Time on the terms and conditions specified in the
instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized,
validly

 



19  issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. The Company
has made available or will make available as soon as practicable after the
date hereof to Parent and the Purchaser an accurate and complete list of all
issued and outstanding Company Options, as of the close of business on April
27, 2012, including (A) the name of each holder of Company Options, (B) the

Options, (C) the number of outstanding, unvested Company Options held by each
such holder, (D) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to each such Company Option, (E) the exercise price of each Company Option,
(F) the vesting schedule (including any vesting acceleration provisions) and
vested status of each such Company Option, and (G) whether such Company
Option is intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code. All Company Options are evidenced by stock
option agreements, in each case in the forms made available by the Company to
Parent and the Purchaser, and no stock option agreement contains terms that
are inconsistent with or in addition to such forms.

(c) Each grant of a Company Option was duly authorized no later than the Grant
Date of such Company Option by all necessary corporate action, including, as
applicable, approval by the Company Board (or a duly constituted and
authorized committee thereof) and any required stockholder approval by the
necessary number of votes. Each such grant was made in all material respects
in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan, the
Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws, including the rules of NASDAQ. The
per share exercise price of each Company Option was equal to no less than the
fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock on the applicable Grant
Date (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company
Stock Option Plan and Section 409A of the Code), and each such grant was
properly accounted for in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements
(including the related notes) of the Company and disclosed in the Company SEC
Documents in accordance with the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws.
The Company has not granted, and there is not, and has not been, any Company
policy or practice to grant, Company Options prior to, or otherwise
coordinate the grant of Company Options with, the release or other public
announcement of material information regarding the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their financial results or prospects. 

(d) Except for the Company Options set forth in _Section 3.2(b)_, there are
no options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments
of any character (i) relating, convertible into or exchangeable for capital
stock of any other Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or (ii) obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, acquire or
sell any Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Since the
close of business on December 31, 2011, the Company has not issued any shares
of its capital stock or other Equity Interests or securities convertible into
or exchangeable for capital stock or other Equity Interest of the Company.

(e) There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (i) restricting the transfer of, (ii) affecting the voting rights
of, (iii) requiring the repurchase, redemption or disposition of, or
containing any right of first refusal with respect to, (iv) requiring the

with respect to, any shares of Company Common Stock or other Equity Interests
in the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 



20 (f) _Section 3.2(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, for
each Company Subsidiary, as applicable: (i) its authorized capital stock or
other Equity Interests, (ii) the number of its outstanding shares of capital
stock or other Equity Interests and type(s) of such outstanding shares of
capital stock or other Equity Interests and (iii) the record owner(s)
thereof. The Company or another Company Subsidiary owns, directly or
indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other
Equity Interests of each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any
Liens, and all of such shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights. Except for Equity Interests in the Company
Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns directly or
indirectly any Equity Interest in any Person (including the Company), or has
any obligation or has made any commitment to acquire any such Equity Interest,
to provide funds to, or to make any investment (in the form of a loan,
capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Company Subsidiary or any other
Person. Since the close of business on December 31, 2010, no Company
Subsidiary has issued any shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests.

3.3 _Authority_.

 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and corporate authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the
exercise of the Top-Up Option and, subsequent to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, if required, the Mergers. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the exercise of the
Top-Up Option and the Mergers, have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company and no stockholder votes or consents are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than, with respect to the Merger, (i) the Company Stockholder Approval, if
required and (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL). The Company
Board, by resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote of those voting on such
matters at a meeting duly called and held, has, and as of the date of this

transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Mergers and (z)
resolved to recommend that the CompanyÂ’s stockholders accept the Offer, tender
their Shares to the Purchaser in the Offer and, to the extent applicable,
adopt this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly authorized and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and the Purchaser, constitutes
a legally valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,

 



21  fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws
affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally and subject to the effect of general
principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

performance of this Agreement, the Offer, the Mergers or the Top-Up Option,
including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, the Tender Agreements or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.13_, no other
"moratorium," "fair price," "business combination," "combinations
with interested stockholders," "control share acquisition" or similar
provision of any state anti-takeover Law or other Law that purports to limit
or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote shares
(collectively, " _Takeover Statutes_ ") is, or at the Effective Time will be,
applicable to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, the
Offer, the Mergers or the Top-Up Option, including the acquisition of Shares
pursuant thereto, the Tender Agreements or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement.

(c) The Company is not a party to any stockholder rights plan or "poison
pill" agreement.

None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the
Company, the acceptance for payment or acquisition of Shares pursuant to the
Offer, the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the consummation by the Company of
the Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or the
CompanyÂ’s compliance with any of the provisions of this Agreement will (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both): (a) subject to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, if required, conflict with or violate any
provision of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws or any equivalent
organizational or governing documents of any Company Subsidiary, (b) assuming
that all consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in _Section
3.5_ have been obtained and all filings and notifications described in
_Section 3.5_ have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have
terminated or expired, violate any Law applicable to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets or (c)
require any consent or approval under, violate, result in any breach of or
any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a default under, or result in
termination or give to others any right of termination, vesting, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien upon any
of the respective properties or assets of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract, Company Permit or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by
which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected, except, with respect to clauses (b) and (c), for any such conflicts,
violations, consents, breaches, losses, defaults, other occurrences or Liens
which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 



22 3.5 _Required Filings and Consents_.

 

Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and the
Purchaser in _Section 4.4_, none of the execution, delivery or performance
of this Agreement by the Company, the acceptance for payment or acquisition of
Shares pursuant to the Offer, the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the
consummation by the Company of the Mergers or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or the CompanyÂ’s compliance with
any of the provisions of this Agreement will require (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) any consent, approval, authorization or permit of,
or filing or registration with or notification to, any Governmental Authority
or any other Person, other than (a) the filing of the Certificate of Merger as
required by the DGCL, (b) the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if

3.6 _Permits; Compliance With Law_.

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary holds all authorizations,
licenses, permits, certificates, variances, exemptions, approvals, orders,
registrations and clearances of any Governmental Authority necessary for the
Company and each Company Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its properties
and assets, and to conduct its business as currently conducted and as
currently planned to be conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where
the failure to hold the same has not had, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is
and since January 1, 2009 has been in compliance with the terms of the
Company Permits, and all of the Company Permits are valid and in full force
and effect, except where the failure to be in compliance with any Company

and effect, individually or in the aggregate, has not had a Company Material
Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, no suspension, modification,
revocation or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or
threatened, except for any such actions that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is or since January 1,
2009 has been in conflict with, default under or violation of, or is being or
since January 1, 2009 has been investigated for, or charged by any
Governmental Authority with a violation of, any Law applicable to the Company

defaults, violations, investigations or charges that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, except for such
investigations or reviews, the outcomes of which if determined adversely to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 



23 (c) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Company

directly or indirectly, given, promised, offered or authorized the same, or
paid anything of value to any recipient that was, is or would be prohibited
under (i) the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or any rules
or regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) any other comparable anti
corruption and/or anti bribery Laws of any Governmental Authority of any
jurisdiction applicable to the Company (whether by virtue of jurisdiction or

Company, the Company Subsidiaries have at all times accurately and fairly
reflected, in reasonable detail, the transactions and disposition of their
respective funds and assets. To the Knowledge of the Company, there have never
been any false or fictitious entries made in the books, records, or accounts
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to any illegal payment or
secret or unrecorded fund, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has established or maintained a secret or unrecorded fund.

(ii) all other applicable import and export control Laws in any countries in
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary conducts business.

definitive proxy statements, schedules, statements and documents required to
be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, together with all certifications required pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (such documents and any other documents filed by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary with the SEC, as have been supplemented,
modified or amended since the time of filing, collectively, the " _Company
SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective filing dates the Company SEC
Documents (i) did not (or with respect to Company SEC Documents filed after

or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading and (ii) complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, as the case may be, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable

SEC.

 



24 (b) All of the audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company and the consolidated

accurately reflect the books and records of the Company and the consolidated
Company Subsidiaries in all material respects, (B) have been or will be, as

basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of interim financial statements, for normal and
recurring year-end adjustments that are not material in amount or nature and

or like form under the Exchange Act) and (C) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of

referred to therein. Without limiting the generality of this _Section
3.7(b)_, since January 1, 2009, (i) no independent public accountant of the

Company on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, (ii) no executive officer of the
Company has failed in any respect to make, without qualification, the
certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any form, report or schedule filed by the
Company with the SEC since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (iii)
no enforcement action has been initiated or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company by the SEC relating to disclosures contained

3.8 _Internal Controls; Sarbanes-Oxley Act_.

 

(a) The Company has designed and maintains a system of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. The Company (i) has designed and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECÂ’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to
the CompanyÂ’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and (ii) since January 1, 2010, has disclosed to the
CompanyÂ’s auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (and made
summaries of such disclosures available to Parent) (A) any known significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the CompanyÂ’s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the CompanyÂ’s internal controls over financial reporting.

 



25 (b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or representative of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any substantive complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, that the Company or any Company Subsidiary
has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No current or
former attorney representing the Company or any Company Subsidiary has

Company, valid, subsisting, and enforceable. The Company and each Company

Company or any Company Subsidiary under a Contract with the Company or a
Company Subsidiary, and who has provided notice of such claim to the Company
or a Company Subsidiary, with respect to such claim. Since May 1, 2006 neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written claim
alleging (i) the invalidity of any of the Company IP or (ii) any infringement,
misappropriation, or violation of any Intellectual Property Right of another
Person by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

have the right to use all Intellectual Property Rights and to the CompanyÂ’s
Knowledge, Technology, used in or necessary for the conduct of the business of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as currently conducted. The Company
IP together with all Company-owned Technology and the Third Party Intellectual
Property constitutes all of the Technology and Intellectual Property Rights
necessary to operate the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as currently conducted, provided that as to Technology, the foregoing is only
to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge.

any Company Proprietary Software where such Person is not, as of the date of
this Agreement, an employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(l) _Open Source_. No Company Proprietary Software is subject to any

of the following functions: disrupting, disabling, harming, or otherwise
impeding in any manner the operation of, or providing unauthorized access to,

measures designed to prevent the introduction of Malicious Code into Company
Proprietary Software, including firewall protections and regular virus scans.

such representation or warranty is reasonably apparent from the text of such
disclosure), Parent, the Purchaser and Merger LLC hereby represent and warrant
to the Company as follows:

 

4.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

Each of Parent, the Purchaser and Merger LLC is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation and has all requisite organizational power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as currently conducted. Each of Parent, the Purchaser and Merger LLC is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially impair the ability of Parent, the Purchaser and Merger LLC to
consummate, or prevent or materially delay, the Offer, Mergers or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



45 4.2 _Authority_.

 

(a) Each of Parent, the Purchaser and Merger LLC has all necessary

each of Parent, the Purchaser and Merger LLC, as applicable, and the
consummation by Parent, the Purchaser and Merger LLC of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the exercise of the Top-Up Option
and the Mergers, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary

authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby other than, with respect to the Merger and the Second Merger, the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly
authorized and validly executed and delivered by Parent, the Purchaser and
Merger LLC, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the

considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(b) Further to _Section 4.2(a)_ , no vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary or required (including
under the NASDAQ rules, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation
or bylaws of Parent or applicable Law) to approve this Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the exercise of the
Top-Up Option and the Mergers. Each of the vote or consent of Parent as the
sole member of Merger LLC and the vote or consent of Merger LLC as sole
stockholder of the Purchaser (both which shall have occurred prior to the

necessary to approve this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer, the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the
Mergers.

violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or any
equivalent organizational or governing documents) of Parent, the Purchaser
and Merger LLC; (b) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and

respect to Competing Proposals or Competing Inquiries or otherwise cooperate

_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (D) take any action to make the
provisions of any Takeover Statute (including Section 203 of the DGCL) or any
applicable anti-takeover provision in the CompanyÂ’s organizational documents
inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a Competing Proposal, (E)
terminate, amend, release, modify or knowingly fail to enforce any provision
of, of grant any permission, waiver or request under, any standstill,
confidentiality of similar contract entered into by the Company in respect of
or in contemplation of a Competing Proposal (other than to the extent the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take
any such actions under this  _Section 5.4(b)(ii)(E)_ would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law) or
(F) propose, resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

No later than 24 hours after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall
notify Parent in writing of the identity of each Person that submitted
a Competing Proposal prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date. Notwithstanding
the commencement of the obligations of the Company under this _Section
5.4(b)_ on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Parties agree that the Company
may continue to engage in the activities described in clause (ii) of _Section
5.4(a)_ with respect to each Excluded Party on and after the No-Shop Period
Start Date until the earlier to occur of (x) the Cut-off Date and (y) such
time as such Person is no longer an Excluded Party; _provided_ that (i) the
provisions of _Sections 5.4(c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h)_ shall apply and
(ii) the Company shall promptly provide to Parent with its notice pursuant to
this _Section 5.4(b)(ii)_ a copy of any Competing Proposal (or, where no such
copy is available, a reasonably detailed description of such Competing
Proposal), in each case including the identity of each Person submitting such
proposal, as well as any modifications thereto, submitted by any Excluded
Party on or prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(b)_
or any other provisions of this Agreement, if, at any time on or after the No-
Shop Period Start Date and prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any of its Representatives receives a written, bona-
fide Competing Proposal from any Person or group of Persons (including but not
limited to an Excluded Party) which did not result from any breach by the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or their Representatives of this _Section
5.4_, (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Competing Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (iii) the Company Board determines in

 



59  good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may (A)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such Competing
Proposal; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within
24 hours) provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that is provided to any Person given such
access which was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives and
(B) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person or group of Persons making such Competing Proposal. 

(d) From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours), notify Parent in the event that the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their Representatives receives (i)
any Competing Proposal or a Competing Inquiry, (ii) any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or requests for
information in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and unrelated to a Competing Proposal or (iii) any Competing Inquiry or
request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal. In
connection with such notice, the Company shall indicate the identity of such
Person or group of Persons and shall provide a copy of such Competing Inquiry,
Competing Proposal, indication, or request (or, where no such copy is
available, a reasonably detailed description of such Competing Inquiry,
Competing Proposal, indication, or request), including any modifications
thereto. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent informed (orally and in
writing) on a current basis (and in any event at ParentÂ’s request and
otherwise no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material changes,
developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any Competing
Inquiry, Competing Proposal, indication, or request (including the material
terms and conditions thereof and of any modification thereto), and any
material developments, discussions and negotiations, including furnishing
copies of any revised written proposals or offers relating thereto. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will enter into any confidentiality
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
_Section 5.4_. 

(e) From and after the date of this Agreement, except as expressly permitted
by this _Section 5.4(e)_ and subject in all respects to _Section 5.4(f)_,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or the Purchaser, the
Company Board Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement, (iii) if a tender
offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the Company
that constitutes a Competing Proposal is commenced, fail to publicly
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the
stockholders of the Company (taking no position with respect to the acceptance
of such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the Company,
shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer) within 10 Business Days after commencement thereof or
fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within four Business Days
after Parent so requests in writing (provided that Parent shall be not be
entitled to request such reaffirmation more than three times), (iv) adopt,
approve or 

 



60  recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any Competing
Proposal made or received after the date of this Agreement (any of the actions
described in clauses (i) through (iv) of this _Section 5.4(e)_, an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (v) cause or permit the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board shall be permitted to
effect any Adverse Recommendation Change (x) described in clause (i) of such
definition or otherwise terminate this Agreement to concurrently enter into a
definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement, in each case solely, under this
clause (x), with respect to a Superior Proposal, subject in each case to
compliance with _Section 5.4(f)_ and the concurrent payment of any amount
owed Parent pursuant to _Section 7.2_, if the Company Board (A) has received
a bona fide written Competing Proposal that the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied
with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by
Parent and the Purchaser pursuant to  _Section 5.4(f)_ and (B) determines in
good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law or (y) in response to a material development or
change in circumstances (that is not a Competing Inquiry or Competing
Proposal) and that was not known to the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement (an " _Intervening Event_ ") if the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;  _provided_ that, the
Company Board may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event unless the Company (A) provides Parent with a written
description of such Intervening Event in reasonable detail, (B) keeps Parent
reasonably informed of material developments with respect to such Intervening
Event, (C) notifies Parent in writing at least four Business Days before
making an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Intervening
Event of its intention to do so and specifying the reasons therefor and (D)
prior to the expiration of such four Business Day period, Parent does not make
a bona fide proposal to amend the terms of this Agreement that the
Company Board determines in good faith would obviate the need to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

(f) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company Board shall not be
entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement, in each case, with respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) none
of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their Representatives has
breached this _Section 5.4_ in any respect as relates to such Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Company has provided written notice (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") to Parent and the Purchaser that the Company intends to
take such action, which notice includes an unredacted copy of the Superior
Proposal that is the basis of such action (including the identity of the
Third Party making the Superior Proposal) and copies of all relevant documents
relating to such Superior Proposal, (iii) during the four Business Days period
following ParentÂ’s and the PurchaserÂ’s receipt of the Notice of Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause the its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent and the Purchaser in good faith (to the extent Parent
and the Purchaser desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal would cease
to constitute a Superior Proposal and (iv) following the end of the four
Business Days period, the Company

 



61  Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into account
any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and the Purchaser
in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior
Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. Any amendment to the financial terms or any
other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice
of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply again with
the requirements of this _Section 5.4(f)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
for purposes of this sentence, references to the four Business Day period
above shall be deemed to be references to a two Business Day period.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through the its Representatives, from
(i) taking and disclosing to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders a position with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9
or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop, look and
listen" communication to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act if the Company Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the directorsÂ’
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
disclosure permitted under _Section 5.4(g)(i)_ that is not an express
rejection of any applicable Competing Proposal or an express reaffirmation of
the Company BoardÂ’s recommendation in favor of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(h) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 5.4_ by any of its Representatives shall be deemed a breach of
this Agreement (including this  _Section 5.4_) by the Company.

5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) The Company and Parent shall use (and cause their respective Subsidiaries
to use) their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Authorities any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders
required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or to avoid any Action or Order by any Governmental Authority,
in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
without limitation the Offer, the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the
Mergers and (iii) promptly make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any
other required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith, with
respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Top-Up Option and the Mergers
required under (A) the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and any other
applicable securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act and any other applicable
competition Laws and (C) any other applicable Law, if any;  _provided_ , that
the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in all respects in
connection with (x) preparing and filing the Offer Documents,

 



62  the Schedule 14D-9, the Proxy Statement and any other filings made or
required to be made with the SEC in connection with the Offer or the Mergers
and the transactions contemplated thereby, (y) making an appropriate filing
pursuant to the HSR Act as set forth in _Section 5.5(d_) and determining
whether any other action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required, in connection with the consummation of the Offer, the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the Mergers and (z) seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers or timely making any such filings. The Company
and Parent shall furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any applicable
Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ as "Outside Counsel Only Material."
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.5_, materials
provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and any Company
Subsidiaries.

(b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to Third Parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any Third Party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) required to
be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable or (iii) required to prevent a Company Material
Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company and Parent shall coordinate and cooperate in
determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required
to be obtained from parties to any Company Material Contracts in connection
with consummation of the Offer, the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
Mergers and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. In the
event that either party shall fail to obtain any Third Party consent described
in the first sentence of this _Section 5.5(b)_, such party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably
requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon the
Company and/or Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective
businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after
the consummation of the Offer or the Effective Time, from the failure to
obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any
Person with respect to the Offer, the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
Mergers, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such Person
and (ii) neither Parent nor the Purchaser shall be required to pay or commit
to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash
or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation due to such Person.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.5_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of any
request, inquiry, objection, charge or other Action, actual or threatened, by
or before the United States Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ "), the United
States Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") or any other applicable Governmental
Authority or any Third Party with respect to the Offer, the

 



63  exercise of the Top-Up Option, the Mergers or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the
status of any such request, inquiry, objection, charge or other Action and
(iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from any
Governmental Authority or any Third Party regarding the Offer, the Top-Up
Option or the Mergers. Each party hereto will (i) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve any such request, inquiry, objection, charge or
other Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) consult and cooperate with the other
parties and consider in good faith the views of the other parties in
connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum,
brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the
Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Mergers or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (such cooperation shall include consultation
with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with the FTC, the DOJ
or any other Governmental Authority or, in connection with any Action by a
Third Party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC,
the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other Person,
providing the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences).

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.5_, each party hereto agrees to: (i) on the date of the commencement of the
Offer, make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act (including seeking early termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act by the FTC or the DOJ and (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable
consistent with this _Section 5.5_ to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required authorizations, as
applicable, under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Parent shall be entitled
to direct the antitrust defense of the Offer, the Mergers or any other
transactions contemplated thereby, or negotiations with, any Governmental
Authority or other Third Party relating to the Offer, the Mergers or
regulatory filings under applicable competition Law, subject to the provisions
of this _Section 5.5_. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide full and effective support of Parent in all
material respects in all such negotiations and other discussions or actions to
the extent requested by Parent. The Company shall not make any offer,
acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Governmental Authority with respect to any proposed
settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy, or, in the event of
litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling,
except as specifically requested by or agreed with Parent. Each party hereto
shall bear its own Expenses in connection with any such filings and actions
contemplated pursuant to this _Section 5.5(d)_. None of Parent,
the Purchaser or the Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental
Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act or applicable competition Laws, without the prior written consent of the
other parties. If any request for additional information and documents,
including a "second request" under the HSR Act, is received from any
Governmental Authority then the Parties shall substantially comply with any 

 



64  such request at the earliest practicable date. If any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
by a Governmental Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of the HSR Act or any applicable antitrust or
competition Law, each of the Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause
their respective Representatives to, cooperate to contest and resist, except
insofar as the Parent and the Company may otherwise agree, any such action or
proceeding, including any action or proceeding that seeks a temporary
restraining order or preliminary injunction that would prohibit, prevent or
restrict consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement
(but subject in all respects to _Section 5.1_), (i) nothing in this _Section
5.5_ shall limit a partyÂ’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Article 7_ hereof and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent,
the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates to agree to (and none of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall, without the prior written consent
of Parent): (A) sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of all or a portion
of its respective business, assets or properties, or conduct its business in a
specified manner, (B) pay any amounts (other than the payment of filing fees
and expenses and fees of counsel), or grant any counterparty to any Contract
any material accommodation, (C) limit in any manner whatsoever the ability of
such entities to conduct, own, operate or control any of their respective
businesses, assets or properties or of the businesses, properties or
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or (D) waive any of the
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ of this Agreement _._

(f) Parent and the Purchaser agree that, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Purchaser shall not, and shall
ensure that none of their Subsidiaries or other Affiliates shall, take any
action or propose, announce an intention or agree, in writing or otherwise, to
take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

5.6 _Certain Notices_.

From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto of (a) the occurrence, or
non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to cause any condition to
the obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the Mergers, or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or (b) the
failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result
in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Offer,
the Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 5.6_ shall not cure any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise
limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.

5.7 _Public Announcements_.

The initial press release with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint
release mutually agreed upon by

 



65  the Company and Parent. Thereafter, none of the parties shall (and each of
the parties shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates, if applicable, not
to) issue any press release or make any public announcement concerning this
Agreement, the Offer, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written consent of (a) the Company, in the
event the disclosing party is Parent, the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or
Representatives or (b) Parent, in the event the disclosing party is the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their Representatives, in each case,
with such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if a party determines in good faith and
based upon advice of counsel, that a press release or public announcement is
required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any
applicable stock exchange, such party may make such press release or public
announcement, in which case the disclosing party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the other parties reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, (ii) this _Section
5.7_ shall terminate upon an Adverse Recommendation Change and (iii) each of
the parties may make public statements in response to specific questions by
the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or
financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not
materially inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company and do not reveal
material, non-public information regarding the other parties, the Offer, the
Mergers or the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.8 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights of
indemnification, exculpation and limitation of liabilities existing in favor
of past and present directors and officers of the Company as provided in the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or under any indemnification, employment
or other similar Contracts between such past and present directors and
officers of the Company and the Company, in each case as in effect on the date
of this Agreement with respect to acts or omissions in their capacity as
directors or officers occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, shall
survive the Mergers and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms (unless otherwise required by applicable Law). From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and
from and after the Second Merger, the Surviving Company to pay and perform in
a timely manner such indemnification obligations. Subject to _Section
5.8(c)_, for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, and from and after the Second Merger, Parent shall cause the
certificate of formation and organizational documents of the Surviving
Company to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, exculpation, and advancement of expenses of directors and
officers of the Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than
are currently set forth in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws (unless
otherwise required by applicable Law).

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation (and from and after the Second Merger, the Surviving
Company) shall maintain for the benefit of the CompanyÂ’s directors and
officers, as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy
that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the

 



66  Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to
and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the CompanyÂ’s
existing policy (accurate and complete copies of which have been previously
provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the
DandO Insurance in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date of this Agreement, which premium the Company represents and warrants to
be as set forth on _Section 5.8(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid policies are obtained by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with substantially
equivalent coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have
been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

 

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Company (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

(d) The obligations under this _Section 5.8_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect any
indemnitee to whom this  _Section 5.8_ applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee, subject to applicable Law (it being expressly agreed that
the indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this  _Section 5.8_).

5.9 _State Takeover Laws_.

 

If any Takeover Statute becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company,
Parent or the Purchaser, the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement, the Offer, the Mergers or the Top-Up Option, including the
acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, the Tender Agreements or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company Board shall take
all action necessary to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

5.10 _Section 16 Matters_.

 

Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will take all such
steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company equity

securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



67 5.11 _Employees and Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of twelve months following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to those employees of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by the Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries (individually, " _Company Employee_ " and collectively, "
_Company Employees_ ") (i) annual base salary or base wages and short-term
incentive compensation opportunities and (ii) benefits (including severance
benefits) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of benefits
(but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or vesting under any
equity incentive plan) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries in which Company Employees first become eligible to
participate after the Effective Time (including any Company Employee Plans)
(the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. In addition, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Company Employee to be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans,
and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents,
to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under
the comparable Company Employee Plans in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the plan year that includes the Effective Time to be taken
into account for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents under any New Plan (to the extent such amounts
would have been taken into account for such requirements under any comparable
Company Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time).

(c) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the date that the Purchaser
and the Company become part of the same controlled group pursuant to Sections
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (the " _Controlled Group Date_ "), unless
otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least ten Business Days prior to
the Controlled Group Date, the Company shall take or cause to be taken all
actions necessary to effect the termination of any and all Company Employee
Plans intended to qualify as qualified cash or deferred arrangements under
Section 401(k) of the Code (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ "). The Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that each such 401(k) Plan has been terminated
pursuant to an action by the Company Board.

 



68 (d) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary under the
CompanyÂ’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " _ESOP_ ") to terminate the
ESOP effective as of the day immediately preceding the Controlled Group Date.
The Company shall make the final contribution to the ESOP immediately after
the date of this Agreement and shall not make any additional contributions to
the ESOP thereafter. The Company shall provide timely notice of termination of
the ESOP in accordance with the terms of the ESOP.

 

5.12 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_.

program or Contract pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or
pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any current or former
director, manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary unless, prior to such entry into, establishment,
amendment or modification, the Compensation Committee (each member of which
the Company Board determined is an "independent director" within the meaning
of Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ rules and shall be an "independent
director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps
as may reasonably be necessary to (a) approve as an Employment Compensation
Arrangement each such plan, program or Contract and (b) satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program or Contract; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 5.12_ shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement. 

5.13 _Stockholder Litigation_.

The Company shall control, and the Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense of, any Action brought by stockholders of the
Company against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer, the exercise of the Top-
Up Option and the Mergers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise,
settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Action arising or resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or consent to the same
without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

5.14 _NASDAQ Matters_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable
on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause
the delisting of the Company and of the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of
the Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such
delisting.

 



69 (b) Prior to the earlier of the consummation of the Offer and the Effective
Time, Parent agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to authorize
for listing on NASDAQ, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and those
required to be reserved for issuance, in connection with the Offer and the

make such other additional filings with NASDAQ as may be required in

Agreement.

At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser or
Parent an affidavit that meets the requirements of Treasury Regulation

form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent.

5.17 _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment_. 

(a) If the conditions to the Second Merger set forth in _Section 6.2_ are
satisfied and the Second Merger is effected, (i) Parent, the Company, and the
Purchaser intend that the Offer, the Merger and the Second Merger, taken
together, be considered a single integrated transaction for United States
federal income Tax purposes qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (ii) each shall, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries to, file all Tax Returns consistent with such
treatment unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Subject to _Section
1.1(c)_, the parties to this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to execute and deliver tax certificates substantially in the forms set
forth in _Exhibits E_ and _F_ to counsel for the Company for purposes of the
opinion described in _Section 6.2_.

(b) Subject to _Section 6.2_, Parent, the Company, and the Purchaser hereby
adopt this Agreement as well as any other agreements entered into pursuant to
this Agreement as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the Regulations. 

 



70 (c) Prior to Closing, the Company shall take, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to take, any action reasonably requested by Parent to minimize any current or
future Tax of the Company, Parent or any of their Affiliates resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided such action would
not adversely affect (i) the ability of counsel to provide the opinion
referred to in _Section 6.2_ or (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to
closing set forth in ARTICLE 6.

 

5.18 _IP Transfer_.

Immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall have effected a
transfer of all rights in the UK SubsidiaryÂ’s intellectual property from its
UK Subsidiary to the Company on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory
to Parent; _provided_ _however_ , that in no event shall the obligations
pursuant to this _Section 5.18_ be considered for purposes of any condition
pursuant _to Section 7.1(f)_ or clauses (e)(iv), e(v) or (e)(vi) of _Annex
I_.

propose to do any of the foregoing; 

(e) By the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if the Company

Agreement and pay the Breakup Fee to Parent pursuant to _Section 7.2_;

(f) By Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if: (i) there shall
be an Uncured Inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the Company

Company Material Adverse Effect since the date hereof and the same is
continuing;

(i) By the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if there has been
a Parent Material Adverse Effect since the date hereof and the same is
continuing; or

case of a termination by the Company, or within two Business Days thereafter,
in the case of a termination by Parent, a termination fee equal to $13.20
million (the " _Breakup Fee_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any such
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ (i) is effected pursuant to entry
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with a Person that is an Excluded
Party or (ii) is prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, then in the case of
clause (i) or (ii) the Breakup Fee shall be an amount equal to $6.27 million;
_provided_ _further_ , that such termination shall not be effective until the
Company pays the Breakup Fee.

 

(c) Parent and the Company agree that if this Agreement is terminated by

such termination right arises from to a breach of a covenant under this
Agreement) and prior to the date of termination of this Agreement a Competing

74  power of the Company; _provided_ , that any definitive agreement or purchase
referred to in clauses (A) and (B), respectively, of this sentence that is
entered into or consummated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary within
12 months of the termination of this Agreement, or if there is no such
definitive agreement with respect to a purchase contemplated by clause (B),
such purchase described in clause (B) is consummated within 12 months of the
termination of this Agreement.

(d) All payments under this _Section 7.2_ shall be made by wire transfer of

acts of the other, (ii) waive any Uncured Inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other with any of the
agreements or covenants contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
any approval of this Agreement by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, there may not be
any extension or waiver of this Agreement which decreases the Merger
Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders hereunder without the approval of such stockholders. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension
or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel

91 8.6 _Headings_.

 

The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

8.7 _Severability_.

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

8.8 _Entire Agreement_.

 

This Agreement, together with the Exhibits, Parent Disclosure Schedule and
Company Disclosure Schedule and the other documents delivered pursuant
hereto, and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of
the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

8.9 _Assignment_.

The Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by operation of law or
otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties; any
assignment without such prior consent shall be null and void.

8.10 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, other than pursuant to _Section 5.8_, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_.

Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which
each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the
parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement,
whenever the context requires: the singular number shall include the plural,
and vice versa, the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter
genders, the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders
and the neuter gender shall include masculine and

 



92  feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and
"including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement
to "Articles," "Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended
to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to
this Agreement. The schedules and exhibits attached to this Agreement
constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein for all
purposes. The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and
words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or article in which
such words appear. All references in this Agreement to "$" are references to
United States dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the
term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive.

 

8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Enforcement; Waiver of Trial by
Jury_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all claims and causes of action arising out of, based
upon, or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed, interpreted and
enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware (without regard
to Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of Laws principles, whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction).

(b) Any action, claim, suit or proceeding between the parties hereto
arising out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought solely in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware and any direct appellate court therefrom). Each
party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts
in respect of any such action, claim, suit or proceeding and agrees that it
will not bring any such action, claim, suit or proceeding in any other court.
Furthermore, each party hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert as
a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such action, claim, suit or
proceeding, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with _Section 8.3_, (ii) any claim that it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the action, claim, suit or proceeding in
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of the action,
claim, suit or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party agrees
that notice or the service of process in any action, claim, suit or
proceeding arising out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be properly served or delivered if
delivered in the manner contemplated by  _Section 8.3_ or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable Law.

 



93 (c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO
ARISING OUT OF, BASED UPON OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES
HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION 8.12(c)_.

8.13 _Counterparts_.

 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including via
facsimile, .pdf or other electronic means), and by the different parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed
to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same agreement.

 

8.14 _Specific Performance_.

The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would
exist and damages would be difficult to determine. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware) and any such injunction shall be in addition to
any other remedy to which any party is entitled, at law or in equity. In
connection with any action for specific performance, each party hereby
irrevocably waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with the remedies referred to in this _Section 8.14_.

condition) and, except as set forth in the following proviso, may be waived by
the Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its

foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of the Purchaser to extend, terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer

The undersigned, for the purpose of amending and restating the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of PLX Technology, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Corporation_ "), does hereby certify that:

been duly adopted pursuant to Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware.  
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation is hereby
amended and restated in its entity as follows: 
---|---|--- 
 

 _FIRST_ : The name of this corporation is PLX Technology, Inc. (the "
_Corporation_ ").

 

 _SECOND_ : The address of the CorporationÂ’s registered office in the State of
Delaware is 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware
19801-1120, and the name of its registered agent at such address is The
Corporation Trust Company.

 

 _THIRD_ : The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") as it now exists or
may hereafter be amended and supplemented.

_FOURTH_ : The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall
have authority to issue is 100 having a par value of $0.001 per share. All
such shares are common stock.

 

 _FIFTH_ : In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by
statute, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to
make, alter or repeal the bylaws of the Company.

_SIXTH_ : To the fullest extent that the DGCL, as it exists on the date
hereof or as it may hereafter be amended, permits the limitation or
elimination of the liability of directors, no director of the Corporation
shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director except to the
extent that exculpation from liability is not permitted under the DGCL as in
effect at the time such liability is determined. Neither the amendment or
repeal of this Article SIXTH, nor the adoption of any provisions in this
Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article SIXTH, shall
eliminate or impair any right or protection of a director of the Corporation
under this Article SIXTH existing at the time of such amendment or repeal.

 



Exhibit A-1  _SEVENTH_ : To the fullest extent that the DGCL, as it exists on the date

administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person is or
was or has agreed to be a director or officer of the Corporation or while a
director or officer is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another

service with respect to employee benefit plans, against expenses
(including attorneyÂ’s fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with
such action, suit, proceeding, or claim. The indemnification and advancement
of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article SEVENTH shall not
limit the Corporation from providing any other indemnification or advancement
of expenses permitted by law and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may
be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise. Such indemnification and advancement of expenses shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the
Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person. Neither the amendment or repeal of this
Article SEVENTH, nor the adoption of any provisions in this Certificate
of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article SEVENTH, shall eliminate or
impair any right or protection of a director or officer of the Corporation
under this Article SEVENTH existing at the time of such amendment or repeal.

 

 _EIGHTH_ : Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the
bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.
