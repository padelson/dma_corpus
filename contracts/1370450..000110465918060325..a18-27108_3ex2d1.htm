entered into as of October 1, 2018, by and among Willdan Energy Solutions, a
California corporation (" _Parent_ "), Luna Fruit, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), Lime
Energy Co., a Delaware corporation (" _Lime_ "), and Luna Stockholder
Representative, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, solely in its
capacity as representative of the Participating Securityholders (in such
capacity, the " _Lime Representative_ ").

 



 

 ** _Recitals_**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Parent desires to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Lime in a reverse subsidiary
merger transaction on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and
Lime have determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of their
respective companies and stockholders for Merger Sub to merge with and into
Lime, with Lime being the surviving entity (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby the issued
and outstanding shares of Lime Stock shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration from Parent;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the board of directors of Lime has determined to recommend that
LimeÂ’s stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement (the " _Lime
Recommendation_ "); and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Parent, Merger Sub and Lime desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties,

have the effects specified in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Lime and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties
of Lime and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

1.2 **Time and Place of Closing.**

 



 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place on the
second (2nd) Business Day after the last of the conditions set forth in
Article IX (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject

 



      
 

 



 

to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived, at the offices of Nelson Mullins Riley and Scarborough
LLP, One Wells Fargo Center, 301 S. College Street, Charlotte, NC 28202, or at
such other time and place as the Parties may mutually agree; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Closing take place prior to October 17,
2018, unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing. The Closing may
be effected by electronic or other transmission of signature pages as mutually
agreed by the Parties.

 



 

1.3 **Effective Time.**

 



 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Parent
and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of merger reflecting the Merger in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to
be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective when the
Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or
at such later time as may be mutually agreed upon by Parent and Lime in
writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the effective time of the
Merger being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 
TERMS OF MERGER**

 



 

2.1 **Certificate of Incorporation.**

 



 

The certificate of incorporation of Lime shall be amended and restated at the
Effective Time in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, and as so amended
and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until otherwise duly amended or repealed.

 



 

2.2 **Bylaws.**

 



 

The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until otherwise duly amended
or repealed; _provided_ , that the name of the corporation set forth therein
shall be changed to the name of Lime.

 



 

2.3 **Directors and Officers.**

 



 

The directors of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time

of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties, each share of
Lime Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Extinguished Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive cash in the amount of the Per Share Merger
Consideration subject

 



      
 

 



 

to withholdings and adjustments as set forth in Sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.6 and
Article VIII. By their adoption and approval of this Agreement, each
Participating Securityholder acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Certificate
of Designation requires that, in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Lime Preferred Holder be paid out of the consideration
available for distribution to the stockholders of Lime before any payment is
made to the holders of Lime Common Stock, by reason of its ownership of Lime
Preferred Stock, an amount in respect of each share of Lime Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time equal to the
greater of (A) the Minimum Preference Amount and (B) the Preferred Converted
Amount; and (ii) this Agreement provides for the consideration payable to the
Participating Stockholders in connection with the Merger consistent with the
provisions of Subsection 4.1 of the Certificate of Designation, including the
allocation and distribution of the Merger Consideration and the Escrow Funds
and the limitations on indemnification set forth in Section 8.6(e).

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, all shares of Lime Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist as of
the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such
shares of Lime Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and any book-entry shares
previously representing any such shares of Lime Stock (the " _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration subject to withholdings and adjustments as set forth in
Sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.6 and Article VIII.

 



 

(c) If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Lime Stock
shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or if a
record date prior to the Effective Time has been established with respect to
any such change in capitalization, then an appropriate and proportionate
adjustment shall be made to the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) Each share of Lime Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and owned by any of the Parties or their respective
Subsidiaries shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired
without payment of any consideration, and shall cease to exist (the "
_Extinguished Shares_ ").

 



 

(e) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001
per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and such shares shall, immediately
following the Merger, represent all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Lime
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
stockholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in compliance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (8 Del. C. Â§ 262) (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into the right to receive any portion of the applicable
consideration for Lime Stock set forth in this Section 3.1, and shall instead
constitute the right to receive only the payment of the appraised value of
such shares as provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such stockholder
fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such stockholderÂ’s
right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such
stockholder to receive such payment in respect of such Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to
receive the applicable consideration for Lime Stock set forth in this Section
3.1, subject to compliance with Section 3.3. In such event, Parent

 



      
 

 



 

shall promptly pay to the Exchange Agent all amounts withheld from the
Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(iii)(3) with respect to such
Dissenting Shares, which amounts shall become part of the Exchange Fund.
Within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
notify each stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and not
voted in favor of or consented to the Merger that the Merger has become
effective. For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for the payment of any and all
amounts payable in connection with the Merger pursuant to Section 262 of DGCL
to each stockholder holding Dissenting Shares.

 



 

3.2 **Payments at Closing.**

 



 

(a) At the Closing, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Acquiom
Financial LLC (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") by wire transfer in immediately
available funds (without any withholding or deduction of any kind except as
otherwise provided for in this Agreement) the following:

 



 

(i) the amount of $600,000 (the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ ") for deposit
into an escrow account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ "), as set forth in
Section 3.7, for the purpose of securing the obligations of the Participating
Securityholders under Article VIII of this Agreement, to be held for the
periods and distributed as provided for in the escrow agreement in
substantially the form set forth as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ");

 



 

(ii) the amount of $250,000 (the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") for deposit
into an escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ "), as set forth in
Section 3.7, for the purpose of securing the obligations of the Participating
Securityholders under Section 3.6 of this Agreement, to be held for the
periods and distributed as provided in the Escrow Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) for exchange in accordance with Section 3.3, an amount (the " _Exchange
Fund_ ") equal to the Merger Consideration minus (1) the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, minus (2) the Indemnity Escrow Amount, minus (3) an amount equal to
the aggregate amounts that would be payable in connection with the Merger to
each stockholder holding Dissenting Shares in respect of such Dissenting
Shares if such stockholder had not demanded appraisal, and minus (4) the
Representative Amount. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Exchange Fund as
contemplated by Section 3.3, and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid on behalf of Lime,
(i) all Transaction Expenses set forth in invoices with respect thereto
delivered by Lime at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to account(s) designated in such
invoices; and (ii) all Closing Indebtedness by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account(s) designated by the holders of such Closing
Indebtedness in payoff letters provided pursuant to Section 9.2(g).

 



 

(c) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the Lime Representative (on behalf
of the Participating Securityholders) $1,000,000, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in writing by the
Lime Representative, for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Lime Representative for, any Third Party expenses pursuant to this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents including to satisfy potential future
obligations of the Lime Representative and/or the Participating
Securityholders to the Lime Representative, including expenses of the Lime
Representative arising from the defense or enforcement of claims pursuant to
Section 3.6 and Article IX (in the aggregate, the " _Representative Amount_
"). The Participating Securityholders will not receive any interest or
earnings on the Representative Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to
the Lime Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had
in any such interest

 



      
 

 



 

or earnings. The Lime Representative will not be liable for any loss of
principal of the Representative Amount other than as a result of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Lime Representative will hold these
funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its
operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily
make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The
Representative Amount shall be retained by the Lime Representative until the
Indemnity Escrow Termination Date or, in the event there are any outstanding
claims for indemnification as of the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date, the
date on which all such claims have been resolved (in either case the "
_Representative Release Date_ "). The Lime Representative shall deposit any
remaining balance of the Representative Amount with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the Participating Securityholders, within three (3) Business
Days after the Representative Release Date, and the Exchange Agent shall
promptly distribute to each Participating Securityholder such Participating
SecurityholderÂ’s Pro Rata Fraction thereof; _provided_ , that (i) with respect
to a Participating Securityholder that is a holder of Exercisable Lime
Options, the Lime Representative shall deposit with the Surviving Corporation
the amount payable to such Participating Securityholder with respect to such
Exercisable Lime Options, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation,
through the Surviving CorporationÂ’s payroll system, on the first normal
payroll date of the Surviving Corporation following such deposit to distribute
such amount to such Participating Securityholder, and (ii) in the discretion
of the Lime Representative, the Lime Representative may make direct payments
to one or more of the Participating Securityholders their respective Pro Rata
Fraction thereof, and in the event of (i) or (ii) in the foregoing, the amount
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be reduced accordingly. For tax
purposes, the Representative Amount will be treated as having been received
and voluntarily set aside by the Participating Securityholders at the time of
Closing.

 



 

(d) The Parties shall direct the Exchange Agent to pay from the Exchange Fund
at Closing (i) to the Surviving Corporation the amount determined in
accordance with Section 3.4(a) to be paid to the applicable holders of
Exercisable Lime Options via the Surviving CorporationÂ’s normal payroll
practices; and (ii) to the holder of the Lime Warrant the amount determined in
accordance with Section 3.4(b).

 



 

3.3 **Exchange Procedures.**

 



 

(a) Unless different timing is agreed to in writing by Parent and Lime, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event no
more than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to the former stockholders of Lime appropriate
transmittal materials. The letter of transmittal shall provide instructions
for the submission of Certificates, or evidence of transfer of Book-Entry
Shares, representing, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shares of Lime
Stock (or an indemnity satisfactory to Lime, Parent and the Exchange Agent, if
any of such Certificates are lost, stolen, or destroyed) to each holder of
record of shares of Lime Stock converted into the right to receive the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Lime Stock represented by one or
more Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that are not registered in the transfer
records of Lime, the Per Share Merger Consideration payable for such shares as
provided in Sections 3.1 may be issued to a transferee, subject to the
deductions provided for in Section 3.2(a), if the Certificate or Certificates
representing such shares are delivered to the Exchange Agent or such Book-
Entry Shares are properly transferred, in each case accompanied by all
documents required to evidence such transfer and by evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Exchange Agent that such transfer is proper and that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. In the event any Certificate
representing Lime Stock shall have been lost, mutilated, stolen, or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, mutilated, stolen, or destroyed and the posting by
such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for

 



      
 

 



 

such lost, mutilated, stolen, or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger
Consideration, subject to the deductions provided for in Section 3.2(a), as
provided for in Section 3.1. The Exchange Agent may establish such other
reasonable and customary rules and procedures in connection with its duties as
it may reasonably deem appropriate. Parent and the Lime Representative (on
behalf of the Participating Securityholders) shall each pay one-half all
charges and expenses of the Exchange Agent in connection with the distribution
of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days), upon surrender of a Certificate or Certificates (or an
indemnity satisfactory to Lime, Parent and the Exchange Agent, if any of such
Certificates are lost, stolen, or destroyed) and a letter of transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto or
receipt of such evidence of transfer of Book-Entry Shares as may be reasonably
requested by the Exchange Agent, pay to the holder of such Certificate(s) or
Book-Entry Shares from the Exchange Fund their respective aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration due to such holder, subject to the deductions provided
for in Section 3.2(a), as provided in Section 3.1, without interest, pursuant
to this Section 3.3, and the Certificate(s) shall forthwith be cancelled. The
Certificate or Certificates of Lime Stock so surrendered shall be duly
endorsed as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require. Parent shall not be
obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former holder of Lime
Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders such
holderÂ’s Certificate or Certificates for exchange (or an indemnity
satisfactory to Lime, Parent and the Exchange Agent, if any of such
Certificates are lost, stolen, or destroyed) or provide evidence of transfer
of such holderÂ’s Book-Entry Shares as provided in this Section 3.3. Any other
provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, neither any Parent Entity, nor
any Lime Entity, nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Lime
Stock for any amounts paid or properly delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar
Law.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Lime Stock, Lime Options and the Lime Warrant such
amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local, or
foreign Tax Law or by any Taxing Authority or Governmental Authority. To the
extent that any amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Lime Stock, Lime Options and the Lime Warrant, as applicable
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

(d) Any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to the Exchange Agent by
Parent pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(iii) that remains unclaimed by the holder of
shares of Lime Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time (as well as any
proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent
to Parent. Any holder of shares of Lime Stock who has not at that time
complied with this Section 3.3 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the
consideration in respect of each share of Lime Stock such holder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon.

 



 

(e) Adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Lime shall constitute
ratification of the appointment of the Exchange Agent.

 



      
 

 



 

3.4 **Lime Options and the Lime Warrant.**

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, all rights with respect to any Lime Common Stock
issuable pursuant to stock options granted by Lime under the Lime Stock Option
Plans that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not exercisable, (i) which have an exercise price below the Per Share Merger
Consideration applicable to each share of Lime Common Stock (the "
_Exercisable Lime Options_ ") shall be converted at the Effective Time into an
obligation of Parent to pay (or cause to be paid) and a right of the holder to
receive, in full satisfaction of any rights in respect of the Exercisable Lime
Options held by such holder, a cash payment equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the number of shares of Lime Common Stock underlying such
PersonÂ’s Exercisable Lime Options by (2) the Per Share Merger Consideration
applicable to each share of Lime Common Stock, subject to the deductions
provided for in Section 3.2(a), less the exercise price per share under such
option, subject to withholdings and adjustments as set forth in Section 3.6
and Article VIII, and (ii) which have an exercise price at or above the Per
Share Merger Consideration applicable to each share of Lime Common Stock (such
stock options, together with the Exercisable Options, the " _Lime Options_ ")
shall be terminated and the holders thereof shall have no right to receive any
portion of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof. The amount determined
in accordance with the foregoing shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation,
to be paid to the applicable holder of an Exercisable Lime Option via the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s normal payroll practices.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, all rights with respect to Lime Common Stock
issuable pursuant to that certain Warrant to Purchase Stock dated as of July
24, 2015, issued by Lime to Heritage Commerce Corp. (the " _Lime Warrant_ ")
to the extent outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not exercisable, shall be converted at the Effective Time into an obligation
of Parent to pay (or cause to be paid) and a right of the holder to receive,
in full satisfaction of any rights in respect of the Lime Warrant, a cash
payment equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares
of Lime Common Stock underlying the Lime Warrant by (2) the Per Share Merger
Consideration (net of the deductions provided for in Section 3.2(a))
applicable to each share of Lime Common Stock less the exercise price per
share under the Lime Warrant, subject to withholdings and adjustments as set
forth in Section 3.6 and Article VIII. The amount determined in accordance
with the foregoing shall be paid to the holder of the Lime Warrant on the
Closing Date.

 



 

(c) LimeÂ’s board of directors or its compensation committee shall make any
adjustments or amendments to or make such determinations with respect to the
Lime Options and the Lime Warrant necessary to effect the foregoing provisions
of this Section 3.4; _provided_ that, prior to the End Date, Lime shall not
amend, terminate or restate (or waive enforcement of) that certain Warrant
Termination Agreement, by and between Heritage Commerce Corp. and Lime, or
those certain Option Termination Agreements, by and between certain Lime stock
option recipients and Lime, each dated as of the date of this Agreement and
entered into in connection with this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld).
For avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Lime
Warrant and all Lime Options terminated in accordance with such Option
Termination Agreements shall be deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time for purposes of Sections 3.4(a) and 3.4(b) above and, in
each such case, shall entitle the holders thereof to the portion of the Merger
Consideration determined in accordance with such Warrant Termination
Agreement, such Option Termination Agreements and Sections 3.4(a) and 3.4(b).

 



 

3.5 **Rights of Former Lime Stockholders.**

 



 

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Lime shall be closed as to
holders of Lime Stock and no transfer of Lime Stock by any holder of such
shares shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange
in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.3, each Certificate and each
Book-Entry Share theretofore representing shares of Lime Stock (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares or Extinguished Shares), shall
from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the

 



      
 

 



 

right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, as
provided in Article III, subject to withholdings and adjustments as set forth
in Sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.6 and Article VIII.

 



 

3.6 **Post-Closing Adjustments to Merger Consideration.**

 



 

(a) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Lime
shall prepare and deliver to Parent a written schedule (the " _Estimated
Closing Statement_ "), in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
C_, together with reasonably detailed calculations of the components thereof,
setting forth LimeÂ’s good faith calculations, as of the Closing, of the (I)
(i) Tangible Assets (excluding Cash), and (ii) Tangible Liabilities (excluding
Indebtedness) (the result of subtracting clause _(ii)_ from clause _(i)_ of
the foregoing, the " _Tangible Net Asset Value_ "), (II) the result of the
Tangible Net Asset Value minus the Target TNAV, which result shall be an
amount (which may be a negative number) designated the " _TNAV Delta_ ", (III)
Closing Indebtedness, (IV) Transaction Expenses, (V) Closing Cash, (VI)
Closing Accrued Compensation, (VII) Closing Material Rebates, and (VIII)
resulting calculation of the Merger Consideration. The Estimated Closing
Statement shall be prepared, and all components thereof shall be calculated,
in conformity with GAAP and, to the extent in conformity with GAAP, in
accordance with LimeÂ’s historical practices and methodologies and in a manner
consistent with the illustrative calculation of Tangible Net Asset Value in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Closing
Adjustment Illustration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of a
conflict between (A) GAAP, (B) the historical practices and methodologies of
Lime and (C) the accounting principles, rules, methods, practices, and
procedures used in the Closing Statement Illustration, the latter, in each
case, of (A), (B) and (C), shall control. Upon the delivery of the Estimated
Closing Statement, Lime shall make available to Parent and its Representatives
the work papers (subject to the execution of customary work paper access
letters, if requested) and other books and records used in preparing the
Estimated Closing Statement.

 



 

(b) Within sixty (60) calendar days following the Closing, Parent shall
prepare and deliver to the Lime Representative a written schedule (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth ParentÂ’s good faith calculations, as of
the Closing, of the (I) Tangible Net Asset Value and TNAV Delta, (II) Closing
Indebtedness, (III) Transaction Expenses, (IV) Closing Cash, (V) Closing
Accrued Compensation, (VI) Closing Material Rebates, and (VII) resulting
calculation of the Merger Consideration; _provided_ , that if Parent fails to
provide such written schedule to the Lime Representative within such 60-day
period, then at the Lime RepresentativeÂ’s election, the Estimated Closing
Statement shall be deemed to be the Closing Statement (without modification)
and shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder;
provided further that nothing herein shall relieve Parent from its obligation
to prepare and deliver such written schedule to the Lime Representative in
accordance with this Section 3.6(b). The Closing Statement shall be prepared,
and all components thereof shall be calculated, in conformity with GAAP and in
accordance with LimeÂ’s historical practices and methodologies and in a manner
consistent with the Closing Adjustment Illustration and shall not include any
changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting
adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event of a conflict between (A) GAAP, (B) the historical practices and
methodologies of Lime and (C) the accounting principles, rules, methods,
practices, and procedures used in the Closing Statement Illustration, the
latter, in each case, of (A), (B) and (C), shall control. Following the
Closing, Parent shall provide the Lime Representative and its Representatives
reasonable access (including by electronic delivery of documents), during
regular business hours, in such a manner as to not unreasonably interfere with
the normal operations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (and subject to
the execution of customary work paper access letters and a customary
confidentiality agreement mutually acceptable to Parent and the Lime
Representative, in each case if reasonably requested), work papers and books
and records utilized in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the
employees and Representatives of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
Affiliates solely for the purpose of

 



      
 

 



 

assisting the Lime Representative in its review of the Closing Statement and
the calculations contained therein. The parties agree that the purpose of
preparing the Closing Statement and determining the Tangible Net Asset Value,
Closing Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses, Closing Cash, Closing Accrued
Compensation and Closing Material Rebates contemplated by this Section 3.6 is
to calculate the Merger Consideration, and such processes are not intended to
permit the introduction of new or different judgments, accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation
methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Closing Statement or
determining the Tangible Net Asset Value, Closing Indebtedness, Transaction
Expenses, Closing Cash, Closing Accrued Compensation and Closing Material
Rebates.

 



 

(c) If the Lime Representative disagrees with the calculations in the Closing
Statement, the Lime Representative shall notify Parent of such disagreement in
writing (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") within thirty (30) days after delivery of
the Closing Statement. The Dispute Notice must set forth in reasonable detail
(i) any item on the Closing Statement which the Lime Representative believes
has not been prepared in accordance with this Agreement and the Lime
RepresentativeÂ’s determination of the amount of such item (to the extent
possible) and (ii) the Lime RepresentativeÂ’s alternative calculation of the
Tangible Net Asset Value, the Closing Indebtedness, the Transaction Expenses,
the Closing Cash, the Closing Accrued Compensation and/or the Closing Material
Rebates, as the case may be (to the extent possible). Any item or amount that
the Lime Representative does not dispute in the Dispute Notice within such
30-day period shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties for all
purposes hereunder. In the event any such Dispute Notice is timely provided,
Parent and the Lime Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts
for a period of fifteen (15) days (or such longer period as they may mutually
agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculations included
in the Closing Statement that were disputed in the Dispute Notice. If, at the
end of such period, the Lime Representative and Parent remain unable to
resolve the dispute in its entirety, then the unresolved items and amounts
thereof in dispute shall be submitted to Grant Thornton LLP, or if such firm
cannot or does not accept such engagement, another nationally recognized
independent accounting firm, reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Lime
Representative, which shall not be the independent accountants of Parent or
Lime (the " _Dispute Auditor_ "). The Dispute Auditor shall determine, based
solely on this Agreement, including the definitions of Tangible Net Asset
Value (and the definitions of the defined terms contained herein) and this
Section 3.6, and the written presentations by the Lime Representative and
Parent, and not by independent review, only those items and amounts that
remain then in dispute as set forth in the Dispute Notice, and the Dispute
Auditor shall not make any other determination. The Lime Representative and
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Auditor
to resolve all amounts in dispute as set forth in the Dispute Notice as soon
as practicable (and in any event within forty-five (45) days after the dispute
is submitted for its determination) and to set forth its determination in a
written statement delivered to the Lime Representative and Parent. A judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction selected pursuant to Section 11.10 hereof
may be entered upon the Dispute AuditorÂ’s determination. The Dispute Auditor
shall have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resorting to the Dispute Auditor
as provided in this Section 3.6(c) shall be the only recourse and remedy of
the parties against one another with respect to, those items and amounts that
remain in dispute under this _Section 3.6(c)_, and neither the Lime
Representative nor Parent shall be entitled to seek indemnification or
recovery of any attorneysÂ’ fees or other professional fees incurred by the
Lime Representative or Parent, as the case may be, in connection with any
dispute governed by this _Section 3.6_. The Dispute Auditor shall allocate
its fees and expenses between Parent and the Lime Representative according to
the degree to which the positions of the respective parties are not accepted
by the Dispute Auditor. In no event shall the decision of the Dispute Auditor
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Parent or the Lime Representative or lesser than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Parent or Lime Representative.
Any determinations made by the Dispute Auditor pursuant to this Section 3.6
shall be final, non-appealable and binding on the parties hereto, absent
manifest error or fraud.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If, upon final determination in accordance with the terms of this Section
3.6 (the date of such final determination, the " _Final Adjustment Amount
Determination Date_ "), the adjustment to the Merger Consideration (the "
_Adjustment Amount_ ") (if any) is a positive number, then the Merger
Consideration shall be increased by the amount of the Adjustment Amount. If
the Adjustment Amount (if any) is a negative number, the Merger Consideration
shall be decreased by the amount of the Adjustment Amount. Any such resulting
amount shall be referred to herein as the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ ". If
the Final Adjustment Amount (if any) is a positive number, within five (5)
Business Days after the Final Adjustment Amount Determination Date, Parent
shall pay the Final Adjustment Amount due to each of the Participating
Securityholders to the Exchange Agent for further distribution to the
applicable holders based on each such holderÂ’s applicable Pro Rata Fraction of
such Final Adjustment Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to a
Participating Securityholder that is a holder of Exercisable Lime Options,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the amount payable to such
Participating Securityholder with respect to such Exercisable Lime Options
through the Surviving CorporationÂ’s payroll system on the first normal payroll
date of the Surviving Corporation following the Final Adjustment Amount
Determination Date, and the amount deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be
reduced accordingly. Prior to any such distribution of the Final Adjustment
Amount to the Participating Securityholders, the Lime Representative shall
deliver to Parent and the Exchange Agent an updated Closing Payment Schedule
(which need not be certified by an officer of Lime) setting forth the portion
of the Adjustment Amount payable to each Participating Securityholder. If the
Final Adjustment Amount (if any) is a negative number then within five (5)
Business Days after the Final Adjustment Amount Determination Date, Parent and
the Lime Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Exchange Agent and Parent shall be entitled to recover the absolute value of
the Final Adjustment Amount from the Adjustment Escrow Account (it being
understood that in no event shall any such recovery be in excess of the then-
available amount in the Adjustment Escrow Account).

 



 

3.7 **Escrow Funds**

 



 

(a) The Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount
(collectively, the " _Escrow Funds_ ") shall be held by the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Funds
shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien,
attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of
the Exchange Agent or any of the other parties to the Escrow Agreement, and
shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Any amounts
held of the Adjustment Escrow Amount following the Final Adjustment Amount
Determination Date shall be released to the Exchange Agent, for payment to the
Participating Securityholders in the manner contemplated by Section 3.6(d),

Agreement, copies of each Employee Benefit Plan currently adopted, maintained
by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed or required to be
contributed to by any Lime Entity or ERISA Affiliate thereof for the benefit
of employees, former employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors,
independent contractors, or other beneficiaries or under which employees,
retirees, former employees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent
contractors, or other beneficiaries are eligible to participate (each, a "
_Lime Benefit Plan_ ," and collectively, the " _Lime Benefit Plans_ "). Any of
Lime Benefit Plans which is an "employee pension benefit plan," as that term
is defined in ERISA Section 3(2), is referred to herein as a " _Lime ERISA
Plan_." Each Lime ERISA Plan which is also a "defined benefit plan" (as
defined in Code Section 414(j)) is referred to herein as a " _Lime Pension
Plan_ ," and is identified as such in Section 4.15 of LimeÂ’s Disclosure
Memorandum.

 



 

(b) Lime has delivered or made available to Parent prior to the execution of
this Agreement (i) all trust agreements or other funding arrangements for all

Lime Benefit Plan, the applicable requirements of the Code, the applicable
requirements of ERISA, and in material compliance with any other applicable
Laws. Since December 31, 2015, Lime has not received any written communication
from any Governmental Authority challenging the compliance of any Lime Benefit

currently being audited by any Governmental Authority for compliance with
applicable Laws. Each Lime Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter (or
in the case of a master or prototype or volume submitter plan, is subject to a
favorable opinion or advisory letter) as to its qualification under the Code,
and nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of such Lime Benefit
Plan that could reasonably be expected to cause the denial or loss of such
qualification.

 



 

(d) There has been no material oral or written representation or communication
with respect to any aspect of the Employee Benefit Plans made to employees of
Lime which is not in accordance with the written or otherwise preexisting
terms and provisions of such plans. Neither Lime nor any administrator or
fiduciary of any Lime Benefit Plan (or any agent of any of the foregoing) has
engaged in any transaction, or acted or failed to act in any manner, which
could subject Lime or Parent to any direct or indirect liability (by indemnity
or otherwise) for breach of any fiduciary, co-fiduciary, or other duty under
ERISA. There are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in
connection with, Lime Benefit Plans other than claims for benefits which are
payable in the ordinary course of business and no action, proceeding,
prosecution, inquiry, hearing, or investigation has been commenced with
respect to any Lime Benefit Plan.

correct and complete in all material respects, have been

 



       
 

 



 

timely filed with the IRS or the DOL, and distributed to participants of Lime
Benefit Plans (as required by Law), and there have been no changes in the
information set forth therein.

 



 

(f) To LimeÂ’s Knowledge, no "party in interest" (as defined in ERISA Section
3(14)) or "disqualified person" (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any
Lime Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt "prohibited transaction"
(described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

 



 

(g) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by Lime or its ERISA Affiliates and no event has occurred that could
reasonably result in liability under Title IV of ERISA being incurred by Lime
or its ERISA Affiliates with respect to any ongoing, frozen, terminated, or
other single-employer plan of Lime or the single-employer plan of any ERISA
Affiliate. There has been no "reportable event," within the meaning of ERISA
Section 4043, for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived
by any ongoing, frozen, terminated or other single employer plan of Lime or of
an ERISA Affiliate.

 



 

(h) No Lime Entity has any liability for retiree health or life benefits under
any of Lime Benefit Plans, except to the extent required under Part 6 of Title
I of ERISA or Code Section 4980B.

 



 

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment
(including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, or
otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of any Lime Entity
from any Lime Entity under any Lime Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase
any benefits otherwise payable under any Lime Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in
any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit, or any
benefit under any life insurance owned by any Lime Entity or the rights of any
Lime Entity in, to or under any insurance on the life of any current or former
officer, director, or employee of any Lime Entity, or change any rights or
obligations of any Lime Entity with respect to such insurance.

 



 

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in connection with
any other event(s)) shall give rise to any "excess parachute payment" as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code or any other amount that would not
be deductible under Section 280G of the Code. No Lime Entity maintains any
obligation to gross-up or reimburse any individual for any Taxes under Section
4999 of the Code.

 



 

(k) No Lime Benefit Plan is or has been funded by, associated with, or related
to a "voluntary employeeÂ’s beneficiary association" within the meaning of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of
Section 419 of the Code, a "qualified asset account" within the meaning of
Section 419A of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within
the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA.

 



 

(l) Neither Lime nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has had an "obligation to
contribute" (as defined in ERISA Section 4212) to, or other obligations or
liability in connection with, a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA
Sections 4001(a)(3) or 3(37)(A)).

 



 

(m) This Section 4.15 constitutes the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of Lime with respect to any employee benefit matters, including
with respect to the Lime Benefit Plans, and no other representation or
warranty contained in any other section of this Agreement shall apply to any
such employee benefit matters and no other representation or warranty, express
or implied, is being made with respect thereto.

a Lime Financial Advisor, dated as of the date of this Agreement, to the
effect that the per-share consideration to be received by the stockholders of
Lime taken as a group on a fully diluted basis (accounting for shares of Lime
Common Stock to be issued immediately before the Closing as a result of the

Consideration to the holders of Lime Preferred Stock as if all shares of such
Lime Preferred Stock had been converted into Lime Common Stock immediately
prior to the Merger) pursuant to the Merger is fair, from a financial point of
view, a signed copy of which has been or will be delivered to Parent at
Closing. The Lime Financial Advisors will have been paid in full as of the

Parent under any circumstances in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

connection with the execution and delivery by Parent or Merger Sub of this

(a) Parent has delivered to Lime a true and complete copy of an executed
commitment letter (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements and
term sheets forming part thereof) addressed to Willdan Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Willdan Group_ "), dated as of September 17, 2018 (the " _BMO
Commitment Letter_ "), from each of BMO Harris Bank N.A. and MUFG Union Bank,
N.A. (including the assignees thereof permitted in accordance with the terms
thereof, collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") and the related fee letters (the "
_Fee Letters_ " and, together with the BMO Commitment Letter, as any of the
same may be amended or modified only in accordance with Section 7.11,
collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), which copies of such Fee
Letters may be redacted in a customary manner to remove the economic terms and
other customarily-redacted provisions set forth therein so long as such
redacted information does not contain terms relating to the conditionality or
availability of the Debt Financing or the reduction of the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing, pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, the Lenders have committed to provide Willdan Group with debt
financing for the Merger in the amount set forth therein (the " _Debt
Financing_ ").

 



 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter constitutes
legal, valid and binding obligations of Willdan Group and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto, is in full force and effect, and is
enforceable against, Willdan Group and, to the Knowledge of Parent, is in full
force and effect, and is enforceable against, the other parties thereto, in
each case in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditorsÂ’ rights generally and except that the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be brought).

 



 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other
Contracts to which Parent or any of its Affiliates, including Willdan Group,
is a party relating to the Debt Financing other than (i) as expressly set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Credit Agreement, dated as of the
date hereof, by and among Willdan Group, as borrower, the guarantors party
thereto, the several banks and other financial institutions party thereto as
lenders, and BMO Harris Bank N.A., as administrative agent, and the Loan
Documents related thereto (as defined therein), and (ii) customary engagement
letters, customary fee rebate or discount letters and non-disclosure
agreements, none of which engagement letters, fee rebate or discount letters
or non-disclosure agreements contain any terms or conditions that would add or
create additional conditions to the full availability of the Debt Financing on
the Closing Date or permit Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Debt
Financing.

 



 

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations
of the Lenders to fund the Debt Financing (including pursuant to any "flex"
provisions) that would permit the Lenders to reduce the total amount

 



      
 

 



 

of the Debt Financing or impose any additional condition precedent to the
availability of the Debt Financing.

 



 

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Debt Commitment Letter has not
been amended or modified (and no such amendment or modification is
contemplated as of the date of this Agreement by Parent or any of its
Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of Parent, by any other party thereto) except
as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to flex
rights or related to the addition of additional financing sources and the
provision of rights to such financing sources in accordance with the terms
thereof and (ii) the respective commitments set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect (and no
Lender has notified Parent or any of its Affiliates of its intention to
withdraw, terminate or rescind its commitment set forth in Debt Commitment
Letter as of the date of this Agreement). As of the date of this Agreement, no
event has occurred which would result in any breach by Willdan Group of, or
constitute a default by Willdan Group under (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute a breach or default), the Debt
Commitment Letter, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, otherwise result in any
portion of the Debt Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable or
delayed (assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1 and
9.2). As of the date of this Agreement, assuming satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Sections 9.1 and 9.2, neither Parent nor Willdan Group
(i) is aware of any fact or occurrence that makes any of the representations
or warranties of Willdan Group in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in any
material respect, (ii) has any reason to believe that it or its Affiliates
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of Closing
to be satisfied by it or its Affiliates contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter, and (iii) has any reason to believe that any portion of the Debt
Financing required to consummate the Merger will not be made available to
Willdan Group or Parent on the Closing Date, including any reason to believe
that the Lenders will not perform their respective funding obligations under
the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with their respective terms and
conditions. Willdan Group has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all
commitment fees and other fees required by the Debt Commitment Letter
(including the Fee Letters) to be paid as of the date of this Agreement, and
will pay (or cause to be paid) in full any other commitment fees and other
fees required to be paid thereunder as and when they become payable.

 



 

(f) Assuming funding of the Debt Financing in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter and assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Sections 9.1 and 9.2, Parent will have at the Closing (i) the financial
resources necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents (including all payments to be made by it hereunder) at
the Closing and (ii) immediately available funds in connection with the Debt
Financing together with available cash in an aggregate amount (after netting
out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums
and charges provided under the Debt Commitment Letter) that will enable Parent
to (x) consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents at the Closing and (y) pay all related fees

 **ARTICLE VII 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

 



 

7.1 **Stockholder Approvals.**

 



 

(a) Lime shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Lime
Stockholder Approval as expeditiously as possible following the execution of
this Agreement, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours following the
execution of this Agreement. Promptly (but in all events within 48 hours)
following the receipt of the Requisite Lime Stockholder Approval, Lime shall
deliver to Parent a certificate executed on behalf of Lime by its secretary
and certifying that the Requisite Lime Stockholder Approval has been obtained
by written consent. Lime shall also promptly (but in all events within eight
(8) Business Days following the date of this Agreement) send, pursuant to
Sections 228 and 262(d) of the DGCL, a written notice to all stockholders of
Lime that did not execute the Requisite Lime Stockholder Approval informing
them that this Agreement was adopted and approved by the stockholders of Lime
and that appraisal rights are available for their shares of Lime Common Stock
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (which notice shall include a copy of such
Section 262), and shall, as soon as practicable, inform Parent of the date on
which such notice was sent.

 



 

(b) Neither LimeÂ’s board of directors nor any committee thereof shall, except
as permitted by this Agreement: (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Lime Recommendation or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (each, an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to obtaining the Requisite Lime Stockholder Approval, the board of
directors of Lime may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if such board of
directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that such action is required by its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of Lime under applicable Law, except that no Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made in response to a Superior Proposal until
after the third Business Day following ParentÂ’s receipt of written notice (a "
_Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") from Lime advising Parent that the board
of directors of Lime or a committee of such board intends to make such an
Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying the material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed

 



       
 

 



 

that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a
new three Business Day period). In determining whether to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal, the board of
directors of Lime shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent during such three-day period in response to a
Notice of Adverse Recommendation.

 



 

(c) Lime shall provide to Parent (i) prompt notice upon receipt by Lime of any
demands for payment of the fair value of shares of Lime Common Stock and any
withdrawals of such demands or other instruments related to such demands
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by Lime and (ii) the right (but not
the obligation) to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands under the DGCL. Lime shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, or as otherwise required under the DGCL, voluntarily make,
or cause or permit to be made, any payment or offer to make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect of
any Dissenting Shares.

 



 

7.2 **Other Offers, etc.**

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the first to occur of the
Effective Time or termination of this Agreement, Lime shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i)
solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate, the making,
submission, or announcement of any proposal that constitutes an Acquisition
Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions (except to notify a Third
Party of the existence of restrictions provided in this Section 7.2) or
negotiations regarding, or disclose or provide any nonpublic information with
respect to, or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) enter into any
agreement (including any agreement in principle, letter of intent or
understanding, merger agreement, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement, or share exchange agreement, but excluding a confidentiality
agreement of the type described below) relating to any Acquisition
Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Requisite Lime
Stockholder Approval, this Section 7.2 shall not prohibit a Lime Entity from
furnishing nonpublic information regarding any Lime Entity to, or entering
into a confidentiality agreement or discussions or negotiations with, any
Person in response to a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal
submitted by such Person if: (A) the Acquisition Proposal did not result from
a breach of this Section 7.2 by any Lime Entity or Representative or Affiliate
thereof, (B) LimeÂ’s board of directors shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, (C) LimeÂ’s board of directors concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to
Lime and its stockholders, (D) (1) Lime gives Parent prompt (but in no event
later than twenty-four (24) hours) notice (which notice may be oral, and, if
oral, shall be subsequently confirmed in writing) (x) of LimeÂ’s receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal and (y) of LimeÂ’s furnishing nonpublic information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, and (2) Lime
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
terms no less favorable to Lime than the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement entered into by Lime and Willdan Group dated as of April 26, 2018,
and (E) contemporaneously with or promptly after furnishing any such nonpublic
information to such Person, Lime furnishes such nonpublic information to
Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously
furnished by Lime to Parent). In addition to the foregoing, Lime shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of the status and material terms
of any such Acquisition Proposal, including any material amendments or
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) In addition to the obligations of Lime set forth in this Section 7.2, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, Lime shall advise Parent of any request
received by Lime for nonpublic information which Lime believes is related to a
potential Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such
request or Acquisition Proposal, and the identity of the Person making any
such request or Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) Lime shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, and Representatives to immediately cease any and all existing
activities, discussions, or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than to advise them of the
existence of this Agreement) and shall use and cause to be used commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar or related
agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

7.3 **Regulatory Filings.**

 



 

Parent shall, promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after
the date hereof, make or cause to be made all filings and submissions under
any applicable Laws in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein (which filings and submissions shall seek early
termination or the equivalent if available). The Parties acknowledge that
initial filings and notices required under the HSR Act were made by each of
Parent and Lime on September 7, 2018. In connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein, Parent shall promptly comply with any
additional requests for information, including requests for production of
documents and production of witnesses for interviews or depositions by any
Governmental Authorities. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Parent shall cooperate in good faith with any Governmental Authorities and
undertake promptly any and all action required to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement expeditiously and lawfully, including (i)
selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or
otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of Lime or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of Lime or Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement;
(iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations of Lime or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; or (v) effectuating any other change
or restructuring of Lime or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in
each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an Order or
decree or file appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in
connection with any of the foregoing and in the case of Litigation instituted
by or with respect to Lime or its businesses or assets, by consenting to such
Litigation instituted by Lime provided, that any such Litigation may, at the
discretion of Lime, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if Litigation is threatened or
instituted by any Governmental Authority or any other entity challenging the
validity or legality or seeking to restrain the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and the Merger Sub shall
use their best efforts to avoid, resist, resolve or, if necessary, defend such
Litigation and shall afford Lime a reasonable opportunity to participate
therein. Parent shall diligently assist and cooperate with Lime in preparing
and filing any and all written communications that are to be submitted to any
Governmental Authorities in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and in obtaining any governmental or Third Party consents, waivers,
authorizations or approvals which may be required to be obtained by Lime in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, which assistance and
cooperation shall include: (i) timely furnishing to Lime all information
concerning Parent and/or its Affiliates that counsel to Lime reasonably
determines is required to be included in such documents or would be helpful in
obtaining such required consent, waiver, authorization or approval; (ii)
promptly providing Lime with copies of all written communications to or from
any Governmental Authority relating to any such required consent, waiver,
authorization or approval; _provided_ , that such copies may be redacted as
necessary to address legal privilege or confidentiality concerns or to comply
with applicable Law; and _provided_ , _further_ , that portions of such copies
that are competitively sensitive may be designated as "outside antitrust
counsel only"; (iii) keeping Lime reasonably informed of any communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by Parent or the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Sub, in each case regarding the Merger; and (iv) permitting Lime to
review and incorporate LimeÂ’s reasonable comments in any communication given
by it to any Governmental Authority or in connection with any proceeding
related to the HSR Act or other applicable Law, in each case regarding the
Merger. Neither Parent nor the Merger Sub, on one hand, nor Lime, on the other
hand, shall initiate, or participate in any meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority with respect to any filings, applications,
investigation, or other inquiry regarding the Merger or filings under the HSR
Act or other applicable Law without giving the other Party reasonable prior
notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted by the
relevant Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meeting or discussion. Parent shall be responsible for all filing fees
under the HSR Act and under any other applicable Laws. Parent shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or
equity in, or by any other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive
agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or
consolidation would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the
obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

7.4 **Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate.**

 



 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to
use, and to cause its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
its reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind any Order adversely affecting
its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and to cause to
be satisfied the conditions referred to in Article IX; _provided_ , that
nothing herein shall preclude any Party from exercising its rights under this
Agreement. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Merger Sub and Lime, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent may take such action, so long as such action
is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

 



 

7.5 **Investigation and Confidentiality.**

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, each Party shall keep the other Party advised of all
material developments relevant to its business and the consummation of the
Merger and shall permit the other Party to make or cause to be made such
investigation of its business and properties (including that of its
Subsidiaries) and of their respective financial and legal conditions as the
other Party reasonably requests; _provided_ , that such investigation shall be
reasonably related to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not
interfere unnecessarily with normal operations.

 



 

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its advisors and agents to, maintain the
confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it by the other
Party concerning its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ businesses, operations, and
financial positions and shall not use such information for any purpose except
in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, each Party shall promptly return
or certify the destruction of all documents and copies thereof, and all work
papers containing confidential information received from the other Party.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Lime shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to exercise, and shall
not waive any of, its rights under confidentiality agreements entered into
with Persons which were considering an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Lime to preserve the confidentiality of the information relating to Lime
Entities provided to such Persons and their Affiliates and Representatives.

 



 

(d) Each Party shall give the other Party notice as soon as practicable after
any determination by it of any fact or occurrence relating to the other Party
which it has discovered through the course of its investigation and which
represents, or is reasonably likely to represent, either a material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of the other Party or
which has had or is reasonably likely to have a Lime Material Adverse Effect
or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

 



 

7.6 **Public Announcements.**

 



 

The Parties agree that no public release or announcement concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any Party
without the prior Consent of the other Parties (which Consent may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except for such release or announcement as
may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of an applicable stock
exchange, in which case the Party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

 



 

7.7 **Employee Benefits and Contracts.**

 



 

(a) All persons who are employees of Lime Entities immediately prior to the
Effective Time and whose employment is not specifically terminated, if any, at
or prior to the Effective Time (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall, at the
Effective Time, become employees of the Surviving Corporation. Except in
respect of those employees of Lime Entities separately provided for as set
forth in those certain employment agreements dated as of the date of this
Agreement to become effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all Lime employment and change of
control agreements existing as of the date of this Agreement that have been
disclosed to Parent in Section 7.7(a) of LimeÂ’s Disclosure Memorandum. All of
the other Continuing Employees shall be employed at will, and no contractual
right with respect to employment shall inure to such employees because of this
Agreement, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Except as provided in the last sentence of this Section 7.7(b), as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available employer-provided health and other
employee welfare benefit plans to each Continuing Employee on the same basis
as it provides such coverage to Parent employees except that any pre-existing
condition, eligibility waiting period, or other limitations or exclusions
otherwise applicable under such plans to new employees shall not apply to a
Continuing Employee or their covered dependents who were covered under a
similar Lime plan at the Effective Time of the Merger. In addition, if any
such transition occurs during a plan year, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any such successor Parent Employee Benefit Plan
providing health coverage to give credit towards satisfaction of any annual
deductible limitation and out-of-pocket maximum applied under such successor
plan for any deductible, co-payment and other cost-sharing amounts previously
paid by a Continuing Employee respecting his or her participation in the
corresponding Lime Employee Benefit Plan during that plan year prior to the
transition effective date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may continue
(or cause the Surviving Corporation to continue) LimeÂ’s health and other
employee welfare benefit plans for each Continuing Employee as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) With respect to employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries not
addressed in Section 7.7(a) or Section 7.7(b) above, Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall make such plans available to each Continuing Employee on
the same basis as it provides such coverage to Parent employees and shall take
into account for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit
accrual (except that there shall not be any benefit accrual for past service
under any qualified defined benefit pension plan) the service of such
employees with Lime and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent
and its Subsidiaries. Continuing Employees will retain credit for unused sick
leave and vacation pay for unused vacation days for the current year only
without carryover of vacation days for prior years, which has been accrued as
of the Effective Time. For purposes of determining the entitlement of
Continuing Employees to sick leave and vacation pay following the Effective
Time, the service of such employees with Lime shall be treated as if such
service were with Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) Parent shall cause the Closing Accrued Compensation to be paid or
discharged after the Effective Time as follows: (i) any and all amounts
accrued for bonuses shall be vested compensation as of the Effective Time and
shall be paid to the employees to which such accrual relates on or before
February 28, 2019, without condition, and (ii) any and all amounts accrued for
deferred compensation shall be paid to the employees to which such accrual
relates in accordance with each applicable deferred compensation agreement;
_provided_ , however, that if any amount of the Closing Accrued Compensation
(x) accrued for bonuses is not paid to the applicable employees for any reason
on or before February 28, 2019, then the Merger Consideration shall be
increased by such amount, which shall be paid to the Participating
Securityholders on such date, or (y) accrued for deferred compensation is not
paid to the applicable employees for any reason on or before February 1, 2020,
then the Merger Consideration shall be increased by such amount, which shall
be paid to the Participating Securityholders on such date. Parent shall
provide the Lime Representative and its Representatives reasonable access
(including by electronic delivery of documents), during regular business
hours, in such a manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the applicable books and
records of the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates solely for the purpose
of performing audits and reviews with respect to compliance with this Section
7.7(d).

 



 

(e) As of the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee shall be eligible to
participate in ParentÂ’s 401(k) plan with full credit for prior service with
Lime for purposes of eligibility and vesting, and otherwise subject to
applicable eligibility requirements as set forth in the 401(k) plan of Lime in
existence as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) No officer, employee, or other Person (other than the corporate Parties to
this Agreement other than the Lime Representative) shall be deemed a Third-
Party or other beneficiary of this Section 7.7, and no such Person shall have
any right or other entitlement to enforce any provision of this Agreement or
seek any remedy in connection with this Agreement (other than in their
capacities as Participating Securityholders), except as set forth in Section
7.7. Nothing in this Section 7.7, express or implied, shall be construed to
(i) create a right in any Continuing Employee to employment with Parent, Lime
or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) limit the right of Parent, Lime or
any of their respective Affiliates to amend or terminate any employee benefit
plan, or (iii) be treated as establishing or amending any employee benefit
plan or arrangement of Parent, Lime or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

7.8 **Directors and Officers Indemnification.**

 



 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time (or, in the case of
Claims that have not been resolved prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, until such Claims are finally resolved), Parent shall
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the present and former directors and
executive officers of Lime Entities (each, an " _D andO Indemnitee_") against
all liabilities (other than

 



      
 

 



 

Losses incurred by such DandO Indemnitees in connection with the indemnification
obligations of the Participating Securityholders pursuant to Article VIII)
arising out of, resulting from or related to any claim, action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or other legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative or investigation (each, a " _Claim_ "), in
which a DandO Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party or witness or
arising out of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of
Lime (or, at LimeÂ’s request, of another Person, including as a trustee of or
in a similar capacity with respect to, an employee benefit plan, prior to the
Effective Time) if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing
or occurring at or before the Effective Time (including the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is
asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the extent
required by applicable Law or by the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
Lime in effect as of the Effective Time. Parent shall promptly pay reasonable
expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) in advance of the final
disposition of any such Claim to each DandO Indemnitee to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such
advance payments if he or she shall be adjudicated to be not entitled to
indemnification under this Section 7.8(a). Parent shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any DandO Indemnitee when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have become final
and non-appealable, that the indemnification of such DandO Indemnitee in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. For a period of
six years after the Effective Time and at all times subject to applicable Law,
the Parent shall not (and shall not cause or permit the Surviving Corporation
or any of the Lime Subsidiaries to) amend or modify in any way adverse to the
DandO Indemnitees, or to the beneficiaries thereof, the exculpation and
indemnification provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of Lime in effect as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase an extended reporting
period endorsement under Lime EntitiesÂ’ existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance coverage (" _Lime D andO Policy_") for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time by such directors and officers currently
covered by the Lime DandO Policy which shall maintain such Lime DandO Policy in
effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that Parent shall not be obligated to make aggregate annual premium payments
for such six (6)-year period in respect of such policy which exceed 300% of
the annual premium payments on LimeÂ’s current policy in effect as of the date
of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the amount of the premiums
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum
Amount, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the most
advantageous policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance
obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. Prior to the Closing,
the Lime Entities shall cause the directors and officers of the Lime Entities
to take all reasonable actions required by the insurance carrier necessary to
procure such endorsement.

 



 

(c) Any DandO Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of
this Section 7.8, upon learning of any such liability, damages, or Litigation,
shall promptly notify Parent thereof in writing ( _provided_ , that a failure
to timely provide such notice shall not relieve Parent of any indemnification
obligation unless, and to the extent that, Parent is materially prejudiced by
such failure). In the event of any such Litigation (whether arising before or
after the Closing), (i) Parent shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and Parent shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that
if Parent elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest
between Parent and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements
therefor are received; _provided_ , that Parent shall be obligated pursuant to
this paragraph (c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for any DandO Indemnitee
in any jurisdiction; (ii) each DandO Indemnitee shall cooperate in good faith in
the defense of any such

 



      
 

 



 

Litigation; (iii) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written Consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and (iv) without the prior written Consent of the DandO
Indemnitee (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
Parent shall not agree to any settlement which does not provide for a complete
and irrevocable release of the DandO Indemnitee.

 



 

(d) Parent covenants and agrees that neither it, nor any successors or
assigns, shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person where Parent or
any such successor or assign shall not be the continuing or surviving Person
of such consolidation or merger or transfer all or substantially all of its
assets to any Person, unless, in each case, proper provision shall have been
made to ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.8.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are intended to be for the benefit of
and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee and their respective heirs
and legal and personal representatives.

 



 

7.9 **Payoff Letters and Lien Releases.**

 



 

From the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, Lime shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver to Parent customary payoff letters in connection with the repayment of
the indebtedness set forth in Section 7.9 of LimeÂ’s Disclosure Memorandum and
to make arrangements for the holders of such indebtedness to deliver, subject
to the receipt of the applicable payoff amounts, customary Lien releases to
Parent as soon as practicable before the Closing.

 



 

7.10 **Tax Matters.**

 



 

(a) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
(including any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be
borne by equally by Parent, on the one hand, and the Participating
Securityholders (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Fraction), on
the other hand. Parent shall timely file any Tax Return or other document with
respect to such Taxes or fees (and the Participating Securityholders and Lime
Representative shall cooperate with respect thereto), notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary.

 



 

(b) Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns required to
be filed by any Lime Entity after the Closing Date with respect to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period. Any such income Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and without a
change of any election or any accounting method and shall be submitted by
Parent to the Lime Representative (together with supporting schedules,
statements and data and, to the extent requested by the Lime Representative,
other supporting documentation) at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. Parent will consider in good
faith any comments provided by the Lime Representative within twenty (20) days
following the receipt of such comments.

 



 

(c) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period,
the portion of any such Taxes that are treated as for and properly allocated
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period for purposes of this Agreement shall be:

 



 

(i) in the case of Taxes (A) based upon, or related to, income, receipts,
profits, wages, capital or net worth, (B) imposed in connection with the sale,
transfer or assignment of property,

 



      
 

 



 

or (C) required to be withheld, in each such case, deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the taxable year ended with the Closing Date; and

 



 

(ii) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire period.

 



 

(d) In the event any Tax Return or claim for refund results in a refund of
Taxes of any Lime Entity for or attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Participating Securityholders,
in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Fraction, any such refund (net of
any Taxes incurred in connection with the receipt of such refund and net of
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Parent or any Lime Entity in filing
such refund claim).

 



 

(e) Parent, on the one hand, and the Lime Representative, on the other hand,
shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of
them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return pursuant to
this Section 7.10 or in connection with any audit or other proceeding in
respect of Taxes of any Lime Entity. Such cooperation and information shall
include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together
with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to
rulings or other determinations by Tax authorities and providing reasonable
access to employees or other service providers involved in the preparation of
the Tax Returns in question. Each of Parent and the Lime Representative shall
retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents
in its possession relating to Tax matters of any Lime Entity for any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified
by the other party in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax
periods. Prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any Tax Returns,
schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its possession
relating to Tax matters of any Lime Entity for any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date, Parent or the Lime Representative (as the case may
be) shall provide the other party with reasonable written notice and offer the
other party the opportunity to take custody of such materials.

(a) Lime shall provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Lime Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its and their Representatives to provide, in each case at ParentÂ’s sole
cost and expense (other than with respect to Section 7.11(a)(v)(A)), such
cooperation as may reasonably be requested by Parent that is customary and
necessary in connection with arranging and obtaining the Financing, including

doubt, any additional financial statements not referenced in clause (A) to
Parent);

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to November 15, 2018,

chief financial officer of Lime with respect to solvency matters) and as are,

accurate, and such customary agreements, documents or certificates that
facilitate the creation, perfection or enforcement of Liens securing the Debt
Financing (including original copies of all certificated securities (with
transfer powers executed in blank) as may be reasonably requested by Parent or
the Lenders, and executing and delivering any customary guaranty, pledge and
security documents and otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral),
provided that no such Lien or pledge shall be effective until Closing;

 



 

(vii) upon ParentÂ’s reasonable request, taking all Lime Entity actions
reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing; and

 



 

(viii) assisting with the preparation of appropriate and customary materials
for offering documents (including prospectuses, private placement memoranda

causing its Representatives (including, without limitation, its attorneys and
auditors) to review and comment on any such documents and producing, in the
case of its auditors, any consents required as a result of including LimeÂ’s
financial statements and other financial data in any such documents.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) Parent shall ensure that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or
operations of the Lime Entities (it being understood and agreed that neither
any Lime Entity nor any of its Representatives shall be required to take any
action that unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business or operations of
the Lime Entities); and (2) neither any Lime Entity nor any of its
Representatives shall, in connection with the Financing: (A) be required to
take any action that would result in a violation of applicable Law or breach
of any material contract or arrangement or, except as set forth in clauses (B)
and (C) below, subject it to actual or potential liability; (B) have any
liability under any Definitive Financing Agreement or any related document or
other agreement or document related to the Financing, other than any such
liability of the Lime Entities following the Closing or liability for costs or

to incur any other liability in connection with the Financing, other than any
other liability incurred by the Lime Entities following

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing or liability for costs or expenses for which the Lime Entities are
reimbursed by Parent; (D) be required to disclose or provide any information
the disclosure of which, in the reasonable judgment of Lime supported by
outside legal counsel, is restricted by contract, applicable Law or order of
any Governmental Authority, is subject to attorney-client privilege, or would
result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any
obligation of the Lime Entities with respect to confidentiality; or (E) be
required to make or assist Willdan Group in making any projections in any
offering document used in the Equity Financing.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, promptly upon request by Lime, reimburse Lime, its
Subsidiaries and/or their respective Representatives for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses, including all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of outside counsel and other
advisors, incurred by Lime, its Subsidiaries or such Representative in

aggregate amount of $200,000; _provided_ that such reimbursement obligations
shall not apply to Section 7.11(a)(v)(A). Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless Lime, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
(collectively, the " _Financing Indemnitees_ ") against any and all Losses
(including advancing reasonably attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any Litigation) directly or indirectly suffered or
incurred by the Financing Indemnitees in connection with the Financing,
including any information provided in connection therewith (other than
information provided by Lime, its Subsidiaries and/or their respective
Representatives expressly for use in connection therewith (excluding for this
purpose any projections or forward looking statements provided by Lime, its
Subsidiaries and/or their respective Representatives) but only to the extent
of such Losses directly arising from such information provided by Lime, its
Subsidiaries and/or their respective Representatives) or the cooperation by
Lime with respect thereto, in each case, other than to the extent arising out
of LimeÂ’s, its SubsidiariesÂ’ or any of their respective RepresentativeÂ’s gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. This Section 7.11(c) shall
survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Closing and any termination of this Agreement, and is intended to
benefit, and may be enforced by, the Financing Indemnitees and their
respective heirs, executors, estates, personal representatives, successors and
assigns, and shall be binding on all successors and permitted assigns of
Parent.

 



 

(d) Lime consents to the reasonable use of its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ logos in
connection with the Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such logos shall
be used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm,
disparage or otherwise adversely affect Lime or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) Other than the obligations to cooperate expressly set forth in this
Section 7.11, no Lime Entity has any responsibility in relation to any
financing that Parent may seek or obtain in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Prior to the Closing, each of Parent and the Merger Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause Willdan Group, its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described
in the Debt Commitment Letter (including with respect to the exercise of any
flex provisions), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto (the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ ") on
the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including
any "flex" provisions), and (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain a
waiver of) all conditions to funding that are applicable to (and within the
control of ) Parent, Willdan Group and the Merger Sub in order for Parent and
Willdan Group to obtain the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, and the Definitive Financing Agreements. If all conditions to the Debt
Commitment Letter have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied (other
than conditions that, by

 



       
 

 



 

their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing), Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause Willdan Group, its Affiliates and its and their Representatives to take,
or cause to be taken, the financing sources under the Debt Commitment Letter
to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the
Merger taking into account cash on hand and other sources of funds available
to the Parent and Willdan Group.

 



 

(g) Parent and the Merger Sub shall give Lime and the Lime Representative
prompt written notice of (i) of any amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification or substitution of the Debt Commitment Letter or any
related Fee Letters (together with a copy of such amendment but subject to
redaction in a customary manner in the case of any Fee Letter), (ii) any
breach or threatened breach (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any breach) of the Debt Commitment Letter of which Parent, Willdan
Group or the Merger Sub becomes aware, (iii) the receipt by Parent, Willdan
Group or Merger Sub, on or prior to the Closing Date, of any notice or other
communication (whether oral or in writing) from any financing source with
respect to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive Financing Agreement, (iv) any
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter of which Parent, Willdan Group or the Merger Sub become
aware, and (v) any action or event of which Parent, Willdan Group or the
Merger Sub become aware that could reasonably be expected to result in all or
a portion of the Debt Financing becoming unavailable in the manner or from the
sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter other than, for avoidance
of doubt, any reduction equal to, and as a result of, the issuance of
additional equity after the date hereof by Parent or Willdan Group, or the
failure of all or any portion of the Equity Financing to occur. If any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (other than, for avoidance of
doubt, any reduction equal to, and as a result of, the issuance of additional
equity after the date hereof by Parent or Willdan Group), Parent shall, as
promptly as practicable, use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing (from the same or alternative sources and on terms and
conditions not less favorable to Lime in the aggregate than the terms and
conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter) in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and on terms and
conditions that comply with Section 7.11(h) as soon as reasonably practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Parent and the Merger Sub shall, and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause Willdan Group and their
respective Representatives to, promptly furnish any information reasonably
requested by Lime or Lime Representatives relating to the Debt Financing,
including with respect to the matters contemplated pursuant to this Section
7.11, and, upon request, otherwise keep Lime and the Lime Representatives
reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing, including any alternative financing as contemplated in this Section
7.11.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 7.11 or in any other
provision of this Agreement, each of Willdan Group, Parent and the Merger Sub
shall have the right from time to time to amend, restate, replace, supplement
or otherwise modify, the Debt Commitment Letter and/or substitute other debt
financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or
alternative financing sources; _provided_ , that any such amendment,
restatement, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any
provision of the Debt Commitment Letter that amends the Debt Financing and/or
substitution of all or any portion of the Debt Financing shall not, without
the prior written consent of Lime (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing) other than, for avoidance of doubt, any
reduction equal to and as a result of, the issuance of additional equity by
Parent or Willdan Group after date hereof, (ii) impose new or additional
material conditions or contingencies or otherwise expand, amend or modify in
any material respect any of the conditions or contingencies to the Debt
Financing, or (iii) be reasonably likely to (x) prevent or materially delay or
impair the ability of Parent and the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (y) adversely impact in any material respect the ability of
Willdan Group, Parent or the Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ , that Willdan Group,
Parent and the Merger Sub may replace, amend, supplement or modify the Debt
Commitment Letter for the purpose of adding agents, coagents, lenders,
arrangers, joint bookrunners or other Persons that have not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, in each case in accordance with the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof so long as such replacement,
amendment, supplement or modification is otherwise in compliance with this
Section 7.11(h). Parent shall not, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause Willdan Group to not, release or consent to the termination of the
obligations of the Lenders and other Persons under the Debt Commitment Letter
except for (x) assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the
terms of, and in connection with, the syndication of the Debt Financing under
the Debt Commitment Letter, or (y) replacements of the Debt Commitment Letter
with alternative financing commitments pursuant to this Section 7.11. If the
Debt Commitment Letter is replaced, amended, supplemented or modified,
including as a result of obtaining alternative financing in accordance with
this Section 7.11, or if Willdan Group, Parent or the Merger Sub substitute
other debt financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing in
accordance with this Section 7.11, each of Parent and the Merger Sub shall
comply, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Willdan Group to
comply, with its obligations in this Agreement, including this Section 7.11,
with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter as so replaced, amended,
supplemented or modified to the same extent that Willdan Group, Parent and the
Merger Sub were obligated to comply prior to the Debt Commitment Letter be
replaced, amended, supplemented or modified.

 



 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement (other than with respect to representations
made by Parent and the Merger Sub as of the date hereof), references to (i)
"Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented,
restated, replaced or substituted by Section 7.11(h), (ii) "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall also include any fee letters or engagement letters (each of
which has been provided to Lime prior to the date hereof) and any amendment,
modification, restatement, supplement and replacement or substitution
permitted by Section 7.11(h) and (iii) "financing sources" shall include
lenders and other financing sources providing the Debt Financing pursuant to
any amendment, modification, restatement, supplement and replacement permitted
by Section 7.11(h).

 



 

(j) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Willdan Group will use its
reasonable best efforts to complete the Debt Financing in amounts as shall be
necessary, together with any proceeds from the Equity Financing, to provide to
Parent at the Closing the financial resources necessary to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents (including all
payments to be made by it hereunder) at the Closing. Prior to the Closing,
Parent shall give Lime and its Representatives a reasonable opportunity to
comment on any filings with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission that reference Lime, the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

7.12 **R andW Insurance Policy.**

 



 

Parent (or one or more of its Affiliates) at its sole expense has entered into
the representation and warranty insurance policies attached hereto as _Exhibit
E_ (the " _R andW Insurance Policy_"). The cost of the premium together with all
taxes and application, underwriting or similar or other fees or expenses in
connection with obtaining and maintaining the RandW Insurance Policy, including
those to bind the policy, shall be paid by Parent. Parent shall not (and shall
cause its Affiliates to not) amend, modify, terminate or waive any provision
concerning the rights of subrogation contained in any RandW Insurance Policy or
any other provision thereof in a manner materially adverse to the
Participating Securityholders without the prior written consent of the Lime
Representative. In accordance with Article VIII, with respect to any claim for

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification under this Agreement for which coverage is available under the
RandW Insurance Policy, Parent shall pursue coverage for such claim under such
RandW Insurance Policy; _provided_ , that if any claim is refused under such RandW
Insurance Policy due to the Fraud of the Lime Entities, Parent may pursue such
claim against the Participating Securityholders in accordance with Article
VIII; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent may pursue claims against the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, in accordance with Article VIII, with respect to any
deductible payable under the RandW Insurance Policy.

future, at law, in equity or otherwise (including with respect to conduct
which is negligent, grossly negligent, willful, intentional, with or without
malice, or a breach of any duty, Law or rule), whether known or unknown,
whether fixed or contingent, whether concealed or hidden, whether disclosed or
undisclosed, whether liquidated or unliquidated, whether foreseeable or
unforeseeable, whether anticipated or unanticipated, whether suspected or
unsuspected, which such Releasing Parties, or any of them, ever have had or
ever in the future may have against the Released Parties, or any of them, and
which are based on acts, events or omissions occurring up to and including the
Effective Time (the " _Released Claims_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
solely with respect to Parent and its Affiliates (excluding the Lime Entities)
and their respective former, present and future Representatives, investors,
stockholders, members, partners, insurers and indemnitees, the foregoing
release shall apply solely to those Released Claims arising in such
Participating SecurityholderÂ’s capacity as a holder of Lime Stock or Lime

herself or itself and each Releasing Party, expressly acknowledges (a) that

THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE
MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR;" (d) acknowledges
that such provisions are designed to protect a party from waiving claims which
it does not know exist or may exist, (e) nonetheless agrees that, effective as
of the Effective Time, such Participating Securityholder and each Releasing

legal proceeding based upon, arising out of, or relating to any of the
Released Claims, (ii) participate, assist, or cooperate in any such
proceeding, or (iii) encourage, assist or solicit any Third Party to institute
any such proceeding.

Lime Entities as of or prior to the Closing Date (A) owed by any Lime Entity
for and properly allocable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) owed by any
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any
Lime Entity (or any predecessor of any Lime Entity) is or was a member on or
prior to the Closing Date as a result of liability arising under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any comparable provisions of foreign, state or
local Law which is properly allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and (C)
owed by any Person imposed on any Lime Entity arising under the principles of
transferee or successor liability or by contract, arising as a result of an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing which is properly allocable
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. For purposes of this Agreement, the amount of
any Tax based on or measured by income or receipts of any Lime Entity that is
allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall
be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the Tax period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which Lime holds a beneficial
interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of any
other Tax of any Lime Entity that is

 



      
 

 



 

allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
_multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
the portion of the Straddle Period that is deemed to end on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the entire
Straddle Period; and

 



 

(d) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or obligation of Lime, prior
to the Closing, or the Lime Representative, under this Agreement.

 



 

8.2 **Indemnification by Parent.**

 



 

Subject to the limits and other terms and conditions of this Article VIII,
from and after the Closing, Parent shall indemnify and hold the Participating
Securityholders and their respective Affiliates, and each of their respective
officers, directors, shareholders, managers, members, trustees, employees,
successors and permitted assigns (each a " _Lime Indemnitee_ ") harmless
against and in respect of any and all Losses which such Lime Indemnitee has
suffered, incurred or become subject to arising out of, based upon or
otherwise in respect of:

 



 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made in
Article V; and

 



 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or obligation of Parent or,
after the Closing, Lime Entity, under this Agreement.

 



 

8.3 **Inter-Party Claims.**

 



 

In order for a Parent Indemnitee or a Lime Indemnitee (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII,
the Indemnified Party shall notify the other Party or Parties from whom such
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") (or in the case the
Indemnifying Party is a Participating Securityholder, the Lime Representative)
in writing reasonably promptly after the occurrence of the event giving rise
to such Indemnified PartyÂ’s claim for indemnification, specifying in
reasonable detail the basis of such claim and estimated amount of Losses (an "
_Inter-Party Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under this
Agreement, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure, or the indemnification
obligations of the Indemnifying Party are materially increased as a result of
such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party reasonable access during normal business hours to the books, records and
assets of the Indemnified Party which evidence or support such claim or the
act, omission or occurrence giving rise to such Inter-Party Claim and the
right, upon prior notice during normal business hours, to interview at a
mutually convenient time any employee or Representative of the Indemnified
Party and its Affiliates related to the act, omission or occurrence giving
rise to such Inter-Party Claim ( _provided_ that such right of access shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Proviso). If the Indemnifying Party disputes
its liability with respect to any such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall proceed to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and,
if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

8.4 **Third Party Claims.**

 



 

(a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a
claim made by any Person (other than by an Indemnified Party, which claims are
addressed in Section 8.3) against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party (or in
the case the Indemnifying Party is a Participating Securityholder, the Lime
Representative) in writing of the Third Party Claim (which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the events giving rise to such Third Party

 



      
 

 



 

Claim and the basis of claiming indemnification hereunder and shall be
accompanied by all relevant notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party as of the date thereof) promptly after
receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided under this Agreement, except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure or the indemnification obligations are materially increased as a
result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, promptly (but in any event within five (5) days) following
the Indemnified PartyÂ’s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) The Indemnified Party shall assume, with the Indemnifying Party being
liable for the actual and reasonable costs and expenses (which costs and
expenses shall constitute Losses for purposes of this Agreement) of one
outside counsel and any local counsel reasonably necessary to defend any such
Third Party Claim (but not any costs and expenses allocated to any internal
counsel) employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim
(other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed
to give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above), the defense
against such Third Party Claim and shall negotiate or handle such Third Party
Claim as necessary; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim at the costs of such Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, settle,
compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying
PartyÂ’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party may also assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim (subject to the limitations set forth below) with counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that if any Participating Securityholder
is the Indemnifying Party and defends against, negotiates, settles or
otherwise handles such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Article VIII,
the reasonable attorneyÂ’s fees and other Losses incurred and paid by the
Indemnifying Party in the defense, negotiation, settlement or other handling
of such Third Party Claim shall reduce (by the amount thereof) the amount
recoverable from the Indemnity Escrow Account by the Indemnified Party.
Subject to the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with such defense. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in such defense and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being
understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party
Claim, all the Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense
or prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s request) the access to and the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees and
Representatives available on a mutually convenient basis during normal
business hours to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided under this Agreement (provided that such right of access
shall be subject to the Confidentiality Proviso). If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not admit any liability with respect
to, settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without the
Indemnified PartyÂ’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party
shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim
that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably recommend and that by its terms (a)
obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full

 



      
 

 



 

amount of Losses in connection with such Third Party Claim and (b) releases
the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates completely in connection with such
Third Party Claim.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to assume control of the defense of a Third Party Claim made under this
Section 8.4 with respect to which any Participating Securityholder is the
Indemnifying Party if (i) such Third Party Claim is made after the date that
is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (the " _Indemnification Period_
"), unless the survival period applicable to such Third Party Claim has not
yet expired in accordance with Section 8.5 or an Indemnified Party otherwise
seeks indemnification hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim, or
(ii) Losses in connection with such Third Party Claim are reasonably estimated
to exceed the amount for which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim in
accordance with this Article VIII.

 



 

8.5 **Survival.**

 



 

The respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Parties contained in this Agreement which survive the Closing in accordance
with Section 10.4, and the rights of the Parties to seek indemnification with
respect thereto in accordance with this Article VIII, shall survive the
Closing as follows: (i) claims for breach of representations and warranties
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) (other than in respect of Fraud), and the rights of
the Parent Indemnitees to seek indemnification with respect thereto, shall
survive until and shall expire on the last day of the Indemnification Period,
(ii) claims for Fraud, claims for breach of Fundamental and Tax Reps pursuant
to Section 8.1(a) and claims under Sections 8.1(c) and 8.1(d) shall each
survive for the duration of the later of (A) the applicable statute of
limitation for breaches of contract and (B) the applicable statute of
limitation for Third Party Claims relating to the applicable indemnity, in
each case plus sixty (60) days thereafter, and (iii) in the case of any
covenant or agreement of the Parties that, by its terms, requires performance
after the Closing, shall survive the Closing in accordance with its terms only
for such period as is required for the respective Party to perform under such
covenant or agreement. The indemnification obligations under this Article VIII
with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of any representation and warranty
shall terminate when the survival of the applicable representation and
warranty terminates pursuant to this Section 8.5; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if a written notice shall have been duly given pursuant to Sections 8.3
or 8.4, as applicable, with respect to a claim for the inaccuracy or breach of
any representation and warranty prior to the termination of the applicable
survival period, such claim with respect to such representation and warranty
shall survive and continue until such claim is finally resolved pursuant to
Sections 8.3 or 8.4, as applicable.

 



 

8.6 **Certain Limitations on Indemnification.**

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the (A) amount
of Losses (except for Losses based upon Fraud) that may be recovered by the
Parent Indemnitees from the Participating Securityholders pursuant to any and
all claims for indemnification made under Section 8.1(b) shall be limited,
individually and in the aggregate, on a cumulative basis, to an amount equal
to the Indemnity Escrow Amount (the " _R andW Cap_"), (B) amount of all Losses
that may be recovered by the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to any and all claims
pursuant to this Article VIII (including pursuant to Sections 8.1(a), 8.1(b),
8.1(c) and 8.1(d) and claims for Fraud) shall be limited, individually and in
the aggregate, on a cumulative basis, to the Merger Consideration, and (C)
maximum aggregate liability of each Participating Securityholder for any and
all Losses pursuant to this Article VIII on a cumulative basis shall be an
amount equal to the portion of the Merger Consideration actually received by
such Participating Securityholder. Nothing in this Section 8.6 shall be deemed
to limit any rights of the Parent Indemnitees as against any insurer under the
RandW Insurance Policy. All claims for indemnification made under this Agreement
by the Parent Indemnitees shall first be sought and satisfied from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount; _provided_ that any amounts recovered by the Parent
Indemnitees

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to a claim for indemnification made other than under Section 8.1(b)
shall not be counted towards the RandW Cap.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other limitations in this Article VIII, the Parent
IndemniteesÂ’ exclusive recourse for Losses (except for Losses based upon
Fraud) pursuant to Section 8.1(b) shall be (i) first, to funds in the
Indemnity Escrow Account then available and (ii) second, after the funds in
the Indemnity Escrow Account have been exhausted or are no longer available,
to the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



 

(c) Subject to the other limitations in this Article VIII, the Parent
IndemniteesÂ’ recourse for Losses pursuant to Sections 8.1(a), 8.1(c) and
8.1(d) shall be (i) first, to the funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account then
available and (ii) second, after the funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account
have been exhausted or are no longer available, directly against the
Participating Securityholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
Indemnities shall be entitled to indemnification directly from the
Participating Securityholders only to the extent the amount of the Losses
remaining after taking into account clause (i) above exceed the coverage
limits of the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement other than the
limitations and exclusive remedies set forth in Section 11.15, the amount of
Losses (except for Losses based upon Fraud) that may be recovered by the Lime
Indemnitees pursuant to any and all claims for indemnification made under
Section 8.2 shall be limited, individually and in the aggregate, on a
cumulative basis, to an amount equal to the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Losses are
to be recovered directly from the Participating Securityholders under Section
7.10 or this Article VIII, then the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled (and
required), subject to the limitations of this Article VIII, to recover Losses
directly from each Participating Securityholder, severally and not jointly, as
follows:

 



 

(i) first, from each Participating Securityholder, up to such Participating
SecurityholderÂ’s Pro Rata Fraction of such amount of Losses as would cause the
Preferred Net Merger Consideration to be reduced to, in the aggregate, the
aggregate Minimum Preference Amount (such Losses, the " **Tier 1 Excess
Losses** ");

 



 

(ii) next, from each Participating Securityholder other than the Participating
Securityholder who was a holder of outstanding shares of Lime Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (in its capacity as such, the " **Lime
Preferred Holder** "), such Participating SecurityholderÂ’s Pro Rata Fraction
(as adjusted to exclude the aggregate Merger Consideration paid in respect of
the Lime Preferred Stock) of such amount of Losses in excess of the Tier 1
Excess Losses that would cause the aggregate Merger Consideration paid to the
Participating Securityholders (other than the Lime Preferred Holder) to be
reduced to $0 (such Losses, the " **Tier 2 Excess Losses** "); and

 



 

(iii) thereafter, from the Lime Preferred Holder, such Losses in excess of the
Tier 2 Excess Losses.

 



 

For avoidance of doubt, this Section 8.6(e) shall not limit the amount of
Losses recoverable against the Lime Preferred Holder in respect of any
outstanding shares of Lime Common Stock held by the Lime Preferred Holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

8.7 **Certain Other Restrictions on Indemnification.**

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Parent
Indemnitee shall have any right to indemnification under this Agreement with
respect to any Losses to the extent (and only to the extent) such Losses are
duplicative of Losses that have previously been recovered hereunder
(including, without limitation, under any RandW Insurance Policy).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
that a Loss for which the Parent Indemnitees would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1 consists of or includes a liability
that is included in, pursuant to Section 3.6, the Tangible Net Asset Value,
Closing Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and/or Closing Accrued
Compensation, then the calculation of such Loss in respect of such matter
shall be reduced by the amount of such liability included in the Tangible Net
Asset Value.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
8.1(b):

 



 

(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses of the Parent
Indemnitees indemnifiable pursuant to Section 8.1(b) exceeds the Threshold, in
which case the Parent Indemnitees may make claims for indemnification pursuant
to Section 8.1(b) against the Indemnity Escrow Amount only for those Losses in
excess of the Threshold; or

 



 

(ii) in excess of, in the cumulative aggregate, the Indemnity Escrow Amount
(except for Losses based upon Fraud).

 



 

Upon payment in full of any Inter-Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.3 or the
payment of any judgment with respect to a Third Party Claim pursuant to
Section 8.4, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the extent of such
payment to the rights of the Indemnified Party against any Person with respect
to the subject matter of such Inter-Party Claim or Third Party Claim, unless
(i) the counterparty to the Third Party Claim or Inter-Party Claim is one of
the twenty (20) largest customers (based upon the dollar amount of total sales
in the then most recently completed fiscal year) or one of the twenty (20)
largest suppliers (based upon the dollar amount of total purchases in the then
most recently completed fiscal year) of the Indemnified Party (other than any
insurance company that has issued an insurance policy that is applicable to
such Third Party Claim or Inter-Party Claim) or (ii) the counterparty to the
Third Party Claim is a Governmental Authority. The Indemnified Parties shall
assign or otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties, at the
cost and expense of the Indemnified Parties, to pursue any claims against, or
otherwise recover amounts from, any Person liable or responsible for any
Losses for which indemnification has been received pursuant to this Agreement,
unless (x) such Person is one of the twenty (20) largest customers (based upon
the dollar amount of total sales in the then most recently completed fiscal
year) or one of the twenty (20) largest suppliers (based upon the dollar
amount of total purchases in the then most recently completed fiscal year) of
the Indemnified Party (other than any insurance company that has issued an
insurance policy that is applicable to such claim) or (y) such Person is a
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement and subject to rights a Participating Securityholder may have under
the Lime DandO Policy, if any Participating Securityholder is the Indemnifying
Party, such Participating Securityholder shall not make any claim for
contribution from any Lime Entity or any of their respective officers,
directors, managers or employees with respect to any indemnity claims arising
under or in connection with this Agreement to the extent that any Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder for such claim, and each
Participating Securityholder waives any such right of contribution from any
Lime Entity or any of its respective officers, directors, managers or
employees it has or may have in the future.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If and to the extent (a) an Indemnified Party or its Affiliates recognizes
any net Indemnification Tax Benefit (as defined below) as a result of any Loss
and (b) such Loss has been indemnified in accordance with Sections 8.1 or 8.2
so that the relevant Indemnified Party has been held harmless against and in
respect of such Loss, such Indemnified Party shall pay the amount of such
Indemnification Tax Benefit to the Indemnifying Party within sixty (60) days
of such Indemnification Tax Benefit being recognized by the Indemnified Party
(to the extent such Indemnification Tax Benefit is recognized prior to the
payment of the Loss, the amount of the Loss shall be reduced by the amount of
Indemnification Tax Benefit actually recognized). For this purpose, the
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize a tax benefit (an
"Indemnification Tax Benefit") if, and to the extent that, the Indemnified
PartyÂ’s liability for Taxes for the taxable year during which the relevant
Loss has occurred, calculated by excluding any Tax items attributed to the
said Loss, exceeds the Indemnified PartyÂ’s actual liability for Taxes for such
taxable year, calculated by taking into account any actual Tax items
attributed to the relevant Loss to the extent such Tax items can be monetized
during such taxable year or the following year.

 



 

(e) Parent and the Participating Securityholders agree to treat any
indemnification payments received pursuant to this Agreement for all Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration to the extent permitted
by applicable Law.

 



 

8.8 **Calculation and Mitigation of Losses.**

 



 

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article VIII shall be net of any amounts recovered by such Indemnified Party
under insurance policies or other collateral sources with respect to such
Losses in excess of the sum of (i) reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and
expenses relating to collection under such policies or other collateral
sources, and (ii) the deductible associated therewith to the extent actually
paid; _provided_ , _however_ , that for avoidance of doubt, items (i) and (ii)
shall not be taken into account with respect to the RandW Insurance Policy. The
Indemnified Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
such insurance policies or collateral sources (which efforts shall not require
the initiation of litigation), and in the event the Indemnified Parties
receive any recovery, the amount of such recovery shall be applied first, to
refund any payments made by the Indemnifying Parties in respect of
indemnification claims pursuant to this Article VIII which would not have been
so paid had such recovery been obtained prior to such payment (provided that
if such payments were made out of the Indemnity Escrow Account and the
Indemnity Escrow Account is still in effect, such amounts shall be returned to
the Indemnity Escrow Account), and second, any excess to the Indemnified
Parties. If a Parent Indemnitee fails to pursue recoveries under any insurance
policies or other collateral sources, then the Participating Securityholders
shall have the right of subrogation to pursue such insurance policies or other
collateral sources and may take any reasonable actions necessary to pursue
such rights of subrogation in their name or the name of the party from whom
subrogation is obtained. Parent shall reasonably cooperate, and cause its
Representatives and Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the successors
to the Lime Entities) to reasonably cooperate, with the Participating
Securityholders to pursue any such subrogation claim. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of Section 7.12 and this Section 8.8(a), the
provision of Section 7.12 shall control.

 



 

(b) Each PartyÂ’s right to indemnification hereunder shall be subject to its
obligations under applicable Law, including under common law, to mitigate
damages.

 



 

(c) Where it is necessary to determine whether a monetary limit or threshold
referred to in this Article VIII has been reached or exceeded and the value of
the claim is expressed in a currency other than USD, the value of that claim
shall be translated into USD at the rate reported by Bloomberg (or if that
service ceases to be available, such other service as Parent and the Lime
Representative may agree,

 



       
 

 



 

acting reasonably) at 5 p.m. on the date on which such claim is settled or
finally judicially determined (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the
Business Day immediately preceding such day).

 



 

8.9 **Exclusive Post-Closing Remedies.**

 



 

The Parties acknowledge, on behalf of themselves and on behalf of the other
Indemnified Parties that, from and after the Closing, except as provided in
Section 8.10 or 11.15, their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in or otherwise
with respect to the subject matter of, this Agreement shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each Party hereby waives, on behalf of itself and each of the
other Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than rights,
claims and causes of action based on Fraud) it may have against any other
Parties arising under or based upon this Agreement, any applicable Law or
otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article VIII and as related to any payment of the Termination Fee, Expense
Reimbursement, Tail Fee and Reverse Termination Fee set forth in Section
10.3), including, but not limited to, its right to pursue any action or claim
other than as expressly stated in Article VIII or Sections 10.3 and 11.15 of
this Agreement.

 



 

8.10 **Special Rule for Fraud.**

 



 

Nothing in this Agreement shall operate to limit the liability of (a) the
Participating Securityholders to Parent for Losses arising from the Fraud of
Lime or the Participating Securityholders if any of Lime or the Participating
Securityholders is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have committed Fraud; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set forth
in Section 8.6(a)(B) and (C) shall apply with respect thereto, or (b) Parent
to the Participating Securityholders for Losses arising from the Fraud of
Parent if Parent is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have committed Fraud against Lime.

the Merger to occur on or before the End Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that

accept a new financing commitment that provides for at least the same amount
of financing as the Debt Commitment Letter and on terms that are not
materially less favorable to Parent and the Merger Sub than the Debt
Commitment Letter; _provided_ further that the conditions to Closing set forth
in Article IX (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived.

the Lime Representative, the Participating Securityholders and any of their
respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,

MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

11.1 **Lime Representative.**

 



 

(a) In addition to the other rights and authority granted to the Lime
Representative elsewhere in this Agreement, upon and by virtue of obtaining
the Requisite Lime Stockholder Approval, all of the Participating
Securityholders collectively and irrevocably constitute and appoint the Lime
Representative as their agent, attorney-in-fact and representative to act from
and after the date hereof and to do any and all things and execute any and all

is of the opinion that it requires further authorization or advice from the
Participating Securityholders on any matters concerning this Agreement, the
Lime Representative shall be entitled to seek such further authorization from
the Participating Securityholders prior to acting on their behalf. In such
event, each Participating Securityholder shall vote in accordance with the Pro
Rata Fraction of the Merger Consideration paid or payable to such
Participating Securityholder in accordance with this Agreement and the
authorization of a majority of such Persons shall be binding on all of the
Participating Securityholders and shall constitute the authorization of the
Participating Securityholders. The appointment of the Lime Representative is
coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable by any Participating
Securityholder in any manner or for any reason. This authority granted to the

any applicable Law. Luna Stockholder Representative, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, hereby accepts its appointment as the initial Lime
Representative. Lime, Parent, the Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to rely on the actions taken by the Lime Representative without
independent inquiry into the capacity of the Lime Representative to so act.

 



 

(c) The Lime Representative may resign from its position as Lime
Representative at any time by written notice delivered to Parent and the
Participating Securityholders. If there is a vacancy at any time in the

filled by the majority vote in accordance with the method set forth in Section
11.1(b) above.

 



 

(d) All acts of the Lime Representative hereunder in its capacity as such
shall be deemed to be acts on behalf of the Participating Securityholders and
not of the Lime Representative individually.

 



      
 

 



 

The Lime Representative shall not have any liability for any amount owed to
Parent by the Participating Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement,
including Section 3.6, in its capacity as the Lime Representative. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the Lime Representative shall not be
liable to Lime, the Participating Securityholders or any other Person in its
capacity as the Lime Representative, for any liability of a Participating
Securityholder or otherwise, or for anything which it may do or refrain from
doing in connection with this Agreement or any agreement ancillary hereto. The
Lime Representative shall not be liable to the Participating Securityholders,
in its capacity as the Lime Representative, for any liability of a
Participating Securityholder or otherwise, or for any error of judgment, or
any act done or step taken or omitted by it in good faith, or for any mistake
in fact or Law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in
connection with this Agreement or any agreement ancillary hereto, except in
the case of the Lime RepresentativeÂ’s gross negligence or willful misconduct
as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall in any circumstance be liable
to the Participating Securityholders for any act done or step taken or omitted
by the Lime Representative. The Lime Representative may seek the advice of

of any of the provisions of this Agreement or its duties or rights hereunder,
and it shall incur no liability in its capacity as the Lime Representative to
Parent, the Merger Sub, Lime, or the Participating Securityholders and shall
be fully protected with respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it
in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel. The Lime

relationship in respect of any Participating Securityholder.

 



 

(e) The Lime Representative may use the Representative Amount to pay any fees,
costs, expenses or other obligations incurred by the Lime Representative
acting in its capacity as such. Without limiting the foregoing, each
Participating Securityholder shall, only to the extent of such Participating
SecurityholderÂ’s Pro Rata Fraction of the Representative Amount, indemnify and
defend the Lime Representative and hold the Lime Representative harmless
against any loss, damage, cost, Losses or expense (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_
") actually incurred without fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct by
the Lime Representative (as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction) and arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance, performance or administration of the Lime RepresentativeÂ’s
duties under this Agreement or any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case
as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Lime Representative shall be entitled
and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct from any amounts owed to
the Participating Securityholders any unpaid or non-reimbursed Representative
Losses at such time as such amounts would otherwise be distributable to the
Participating Securityholders. Additionally, in connection with any unpaid or
non-reimbursed Representative Losses, the Lime Representative shall be
entitled and is hereby granted the right to direct any funds that would
otherwise be actually payable to the Participating Securityholders from the
Escrow Funds to itself no earlier than the date such payments are actually
made. The Lime Representative may also from time to time submit invoices to
the Participating Securityholders covering such Representative Losses, which
shall be paid by the Participating Securityholders promptly following the
receipt thereof based on their respective Pro Rata Fraction. The foregoing
indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Lime
Representative or the termination of this Agreement. Upon the request of any
Participating Securityholder, the Lime Representative shall provide such
Participating Securityholder with an accounting of all expenses and Losses
paid by the Lime Representative in its capacity as such.

11.10 **Governing Law.**

 



 

Regardless of any conflict of law or choice of law principles that might
otherwise apply, the Parties agree that this Agreement, the Merger and any
matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby shall be governed by and construed in all respects in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. Any Litigation instituted
by any Party seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought and determined exclusively in Chancery
Court in the State of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such Litigation and irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such Litigation in any such court or that any
such litigation which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such Litigation may be served on any Party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of
notice on such Party as provided in Section 11.9 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such Party. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
11.10 to the contrary, each of

 



      
 

 



 

the Parties agrees that it will not bring or support any Litigation against
the Lenders, any other Persons that have committed to provide or arrange all
or any part of the Debt Financing, together with their respective Affiliates,
and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives, and their respective successors and assigns (each such
Person, a " _Debt Financing Source_ ") in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof or the Debt Financing (including the transactions
contemplated thereby), in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). The
provisions of this Section 11.10 shall be enforceable by each Debt Financing
Source, its Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

11.11 **Waiver of Jury Trial.**

 



 

Each Party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Litigation or other
proceeding arising out of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document, or
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including but not limited to
any dispute arising out of or relating to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance or failure to perform thereof.

 



 

11.12 **Counterparts.**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

 



 

11.13 **Captions; Articles and Sections.**

 



 

The captions contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
are not part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to
particular Articles or Sections shall mean and refer to the referenced
Articles and Sections of this Agreement. Disclosure of an item in one of
LimeÂ’s Disclosure Memorandum or ParentÂ’s Disclosure Memorandum, as applicable,
shall be deemed to modify both (i) the representations and warranties
contained in the section of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number
and (ii) any other representation and warranty of Lime or Parent, as
applicable, in this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent
from a reading of such disclosure item that it would also qualify or apply to
such other representation and warranty.

 



 

11.14 **Interpretations.**

 



 

Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be
construed or resolved against any Party, whether under any rule of
construction or otherwise. No Party to this Agreement shall be considered the
drafter. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement has been
reviewed, negotiated, and accepted by all Parties and their attorneys and
shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the
words used so as fairly to accomplish the purposes and intentions of all
Parties hereto.

 



 

11.15 **Enforcement of Agreement.**

 



 

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, without the necessity of proving actual damages, proving the
inadequacy of money damages,

 



      
 

 



 

proving the likelihood of success, or (to the extent permitted by Law) posting
a bond or other security; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Lime has the right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1(g), then Lime
shall not be entitled to specific performance and the Reverse Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Lime and any other Person, and all
other remedies (including without limitation remedies pursuant to Section 8.2,
for money damages, or for specific performance or any other equitable
remedies) shall be deemed waived against Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their
Affiliates for any Loss, liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and upon payment of the Reverse Termination
Fee to Lime, none of Parent, Merger Sub, Lime, any Participating
Securityholder or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, other than obligations pursuant to Section 7.11(c), which shall
survive such termination; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent terminates
this Agreement in accordance with Sections 10.1(c)(iii) or 10.1(e), or if Lime
terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1(f) then in each case
the Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement and Tail Fees shall be the
exclusive remedies of Parent, Merger Sub and any other Person, and all other
remedies (including without limitation remedies pursuant to Section 8.1, for
money damages, or for specific performance or any other equitable remedies)
shall be deemed waived against Lime, the Participating Securityholders, or any
of their Affiliates for any Loss, liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and upon payment of the
Termination Fee (or, as applicable, the Expense Reimbursement and Tail Fee) to
Parent, none of Lime, any Participating Securityholder, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Lime, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates and their respective members, partners, stockholders, agents,
attorneys, advisors or representatives, agrees that none of the Debt Financing
Sources shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) to any such person relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein (including the Debt Financing), waives any
rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement (and the transactions contemplated hereby) or the Debt Financing
(including the transactions contemplated thereby), whether at law or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, and agrees not to commence any action,
arbitration, audit hearing, investigation, litigation, petition, grievance,
complaint, suit or proceeding against any Debt Financing Source in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder (including
relating to the Debt Financing).

 



 

11.16 **Severability.**

 



 

Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

11.17 **Waiver of Conflict.**

 



 

Recognizing that Nelson Mullins Riley and Scarborough LLP (" _NMRS_ ") has acted
as legal counsel to certain holders of Lime Stock and the Lime Entities prior
to the Closing, and that NMRS intends to act as legal counsel to certain
holders of Lime Stock after the Closing, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (including on behalf of Lime) hereby waives, on its own behalf and
agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in
connection with NMRS representing any of the holders of Lime Stock and/or its
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent, Lime
or the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated herein. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client
confidences between any holders of Lime Stock and its Affiliates in the course
of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (collectively, " _Acquisition Privileged Communications_
") shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
such holders of Lime Stock and their Affiliates (and not Lime). Accordingly,
Lime shall not have access to any Acquisition Privileged Communications, or to
the files of NMRS relating to such engagement, whether or not the Closing
shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon
and after the Closing, (i) the applicable holders of Lime Stock and their
Affiliates (and not Lime) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client
privilege with respect to such engagement, and neither Lime nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of NMRS
in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only the
applicable holders of Lime Stock and their Affiliates (and not Lime) shall
hold such property rights and (iii) NMRS shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to Lime by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between NMRS and Lime or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent or Lime and a Third Party (other than a party to this Agreement or any
of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
(including on behalf of Lime) may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications by NMRS to such Third Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may not waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the holders of Lime Stock.
Parent agrees that it shall not, and that after the Closing it shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) not to, (i) access or use the
Acquisition Privileged Communications, including by way of review of any
electronic data, communications or other information, or by otherwise
asserting that Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) has the right to waive the attorney-client or other privilege, or
(ii) seek to obtain the Acquisition Privileged Communications from NMRS.

 



 

11.18 **Release.**

 



 

Parent and Merger Sub agree that except as provided for in this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, the obligations
and agreements set forth in Articles VII and VIII hereof) or any other
Transaction Document, effective as of the Effective Time, Lime shall be deemed
to have absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably, acquitted, released and
forever discharged, and shall have caused Lime and the Lime Subsidiaries to
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably, acquit, release and forever
discharge, each Participating Securityholder (whether in such stockholderÂ’s
capacity as an equityholder, director, officer, employee, representative or
otherwise) of and from any and all manner of action or inaction, cause or
causes of action, Litigation, Liens, contracts, promises, liabilities or
damages (whether for compensatory, special, incidental or punitive damages,
equitable relief or otherwise) of any kind or nature whatsoever, past, present
or future, at law, in equity or otherwise (including with respect to conduct
which is negligent, grossly negligent, willful, intentional, with or without
malice, or a breach of any duty, Law or rule), whether known or unknown,
whether fixed or contingent, whether concealed or hidden, whether disclosed or
undisclosed, whether liquidated or unliquidated, whether foreseeable or
unforeseeable, whether anticipated or unanticipated, whether suspected or
unsuspected, which any Lime Entity ever has had or ever in the future may have
against any such Participating Securityholder which are based on acts, events
or omissions occurring up to and including the Effective Time relating to,
arising out of or in any way connected with the dealings of Lime or any Lime
Subsidiary from the beginning of time through the Closing Date. Parent, Merger
Sub and Lime (on behalf of itself and each Lime Subsidiary): (a) expressly
acknowledges that the foregoing release is intended to include in its effect
all claims any Lime Entity does not know or suspect to exist in its favor
(including unknown and contingent claims), (b) acknowledges that the laws of
many states provide substantially the following: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT
EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS
OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR
HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR;" (c)
acknowledges that such provisions are designed to protect a party from waiving
claims

 



      
 

 



 

which it does not know exist or may exist, (d) nonetheless agrees that,
effective as of the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub, Lime and the Lime
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to waive any such provision, and (e) further
agree that none of Parent, Merger Sub, Lime or any Lime Subsidiary, and no
controlled Affiliate of any of them, shall (i) institute a mediation,
arbitration, lawsuit or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out of, or
relating to any of the released claims, (ii) participate, assist, or cooperate
in any such proceeding, or (iii) encourage, assist or solicit any Third Party
to institute any such proceeding.

 



 

11.19 **Disclosure Memorandum.**

 



 

LimeÂ’s Disclosure Memorandum shall be construed with and as an integral part
of this Agreement to the same extent as if it was set forth verbatim herein.
Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
LimeÂ’s Disclosure Memorandum is intended to vary the definition of the term
"Material Adverse Effect" or to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and
no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the
inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the Parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included
in LimeÂ’s Disclosure Memorandum is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in LimeÂ’s
Disclosure Memorandum is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other
items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business, and no
Party or other express beneficiary hereof shall use the fact of the setting
