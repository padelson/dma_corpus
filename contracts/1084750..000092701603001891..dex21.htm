WHEREAS, this Agreement contemplates a merger of the Transitory Subsidiary
into the Company whereby the shareholders of the Company will receive cash in
exchange for their capital stock of the Company.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties and
covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows.



ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Upon and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Transitory Subsidiary shall merge with and into the Company at
the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the Surviving Corporation. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 1107 of the California General Corporation Law.



1.2 _The Closing_. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Hale and
Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, MA 02109, commencing at 9:00 a.m. local
time on the Closing Date.



1.3 _Actions at the Closing_. At the Closing: 



(a) the Company shall deliver to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary the
various certificates, instruments and documents referred to in Section 5.2;



(b) the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall deliver to the Company the
various certificates, instruments and documents referred to in Section 5.3;



(c) the Surviving Corporation shall file with the Secretary of State of the
State of California and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the
applicable Merger Filings; and



(d) subject to Sections 1.7 and 1.9, the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid
to each holder of Preferred Shares represented by Early Surrendered
Certificates, the Preferred Payment Amount payable in respect of such
Preferred Shares.



1.4 _Additional Action_. The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the
Effective Time, take any action, including executing and delivering any
document, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or the Transitory
Subsidiary, in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



1.5 _Conversion of Company Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or the holder of any
of the following securities:



(a) Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive an amount per share equal to the quotient of (i) $192,500 over (ii) the number of Common
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(b) Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive an amount per share equal to the quotient of
(i) $1,732,500 over (ii) the number of Preferred Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Preferred Payment
Amount").



(c) Each Company Share held in the Companys treasury immediately prior to the
Effective Time and each Company Share owned beneficially by the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor.



(d) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Transitory
Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and thereafter evidence one share of common stock,
$0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



1.6 _Termination of Company Options_. Effective not later than March 13, 2003,
the Company shall cause each outstanding Company Option to terminate in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan pursuant to
which such Company Option was granted. Effective not later than the Effective
Time each Company Stock Plan shall be terminated.



1.7 _Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless such Company Shareholders right to
appraisal shall have ceased in accordance with Section 1309 of the California
General Corporation Law. If such Company Shareholder has so forfeited
or withdrawn his, her or its right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then,
as of the occurrence of such event, such holders Dissenting Shares shall
cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company
Shares or Subject Common Shares pursuant to Sections 1.5.



(b) The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any

demands for appraisal under the California General Corporation Law.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Buyer,

or offer to settle or settle any such demands.



1.8 _Articles of Incorporation and By-laws_. 



(a) The Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time shall be the same as the Certificate of

Time (with such changes as may be required to comply and/or to conform with
California General Corporation Law), except that (i) the name of the
corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Company and
(ii) the indemnification provisions contained in the Surviving
Corporations Articles of Incorporation shall provide for indemnification, in
all material respects, as the provisions contained in the Companys Articles
of Incorporation.



(b) The By-laws of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time shall be the same as the By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with such changes as may be required
to comply and/or to conform with California General



 

-2- Corporation Law), except that the name of the corporation set forth therein
shall be changed to the name of the Company.



1.9 _Exchange Procedures._  The procedures for exchanging outstanding Common
Shares and Preferred Shares pursuant to the Merger are as follows:



(a) Not later than five business days following the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered, to each holder
of record of a certificate or certificates representing Common Shares and, to
the extent that a holder of record of a certificate or certificates
representing Preferred Shares has not previously surrendered such certificate
or certificates to the Surviving Corporation prior to the Closing Date (such
surrendered certificate or certificates, "Early Surrendered Certificates"), to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates representing Preferred
Shares, in each case determined immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a "Certificate"): (A) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Surviving
Corporation and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the
Buyer may reasonably specify, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Surviving Corporation or to
such agent or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation,
together, in the case of Certificates that are not Early
Surrendered Certificates, with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation
shall deliver in exchange therefor, the applicable Merger Consideration and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect of Common Shares and Preferred Shares shall be
made by the Buyer (i) in the case of Preferred Shares represented by Early
Surrendered Certificates, on the Closing Date by wire transfer to an account
specified to the Buyer in writing by the record holder of such Early
Surrendered Certificates at least two business days prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) in the case of Common Shares and Preferred Shares (other than
Preferred Shares represented by Early Surrendered Certificates), as soon as
the practicable following surrender of such Certificates and the applicable
letter of transmittal, and in no case more than 10 business days from the
date of such surrender, by check to the address set forth in the letter of
transmittal. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to
the Effective Time, represented Company Shares will be deemed from and after
the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of each such share (subject to Section 1.7).



(b) At the Effective Time, Company Shares shall no longer be issued and
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist (subject to Section 1.7). The Merger Consideration when delivered
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing Company Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation.



(c) In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Buyer shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer of that fact by the holder thereof, the amount of
Merger Consideration as may payable with respect to such Certificate pursuant
to this Article I; provided, however, that the Buyer may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of any
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond (or such
other indemnity agreement) in such sum as the Buyer may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed. 



 

-3- (d) If any payment is to be made to a person other than the holder in whose
name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will
be a condition of the payment thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will
be properly endorsed and accompanied by all documents required to evidence
and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid.



(e) No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration.



1.10 _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Company Shares shall
thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, certificates formerly
representing Company Shares are presented to the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration, subject to Section 1.7 in the case of Dissenting Shares and to
applicable law.
