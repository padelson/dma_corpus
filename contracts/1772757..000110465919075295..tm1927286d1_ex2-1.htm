review. The resolution of any such dispute by the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding on the parties hereto absent

no more than one time by a Party after which the determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding. The fees

in good faith such other Party&rsquo;s views) before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority and promptly
supplying the other Parties with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between any Party and any Governmental
Authority with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions. Such information can be shared on an outside counsel basis or subject

by a Governmental Authority, each Party hereto shall permit Representatives of the other Parties (or counsel of that Party on confidential
basis in case of sensitive information being deliberated) to participate in material substantive meetings (whether by telephone
or in person) with such Governmental Authority. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts and closely collaborate on the

party or any of their respective Subsidiaries under the HSR Act or other applicable Competition Laws or as required by or advisable
with respect to Gaming Regulatory Authorities, (y)&nbsp;avoid the entry of any judgment in any claim asserted in court by any Governmental
Authority under any Competition Laws or Applicable Gaming Laws that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing or the ability
of New DK to operate the businesses of DK and SBT and their respective Subsidiaries following the Closing as conducted immediately
prior to the Closing in all material respects or (z)&nbsp;contest or avoid any action, proceeding or litigation by any Governmental
Authority under the HSR Act or other applicable Competition Laws or Applicable Gaming Laws.</P>

or, with respect to Israeli withholding tax, a withholding certificate from the ITA which determines the withholding tax rate
or tax amount, to the full satisfaction of New DK and DK (and for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to Israeli Taxes, a Valid

payment recipient and no amounts for Israeli Taxes shall be withheld from the payments deliverable pursuant to this Agreement,
except as provided below and during which time each payment recipient may obtain a Valid Tax Certificate). If a payment recipient
delivers, no later than five (5)&nbsp;Business Days prior to the applicable Withholding Drop Date a Valid Tax Certificate to the
Paying Agent, then the deduction and withholding of any Israeli Taxes shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of
such Valid Tax Certificate. If any payment recipient (i)&nbsp;does not provide the Paying Agent with a Valid Tax Certificate by
no later than five (5)&nbsp;Business Days before the applicable Withholding Drop Date, or (ii)&nbsp;submits a written request
to the Paying Agent to release his portion of the SBT Cash Consideration, as may be adjusted, the Escrow Amount or the Adjustment

five (5)&nbsp;Business Days before such time, then the amount to be withheld from such payment recipient&rsquo;s portion of the

to the withholding rate under applicable Israeli Law, which amount shall be calculated in New Israel Shekels based on the euro-NIS

on account of Israeli Taxes shall apply with respect to a SBT Security Holder who is not an Israeli Tax Resident (and with respect
to an SBT Seller who is an Israeli Tax Resident, any withholding, if any, shall be only in accordance with Sections 13.2 and 13.6);

Security Holder or 102 Trustee as applicable, by the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Paying
Agent Agreement. A &ldquo;Valid Tax Certificate<B>&rdquo;</B> means a valid and applicable certificate or ruling issued by the

Tax is required with respect to a payment recipient. An &quot;Israeli Tax Resident&quot; shall mean a taxpayer that did not properly
execute the declaration set forth in Exhibit&nbsp;G at least five (5)&nbsp;Business Days prior to the payment date.</P>

Registration Statement under the Securities Act to permit the public resale of all the Registrable Securities held by the Stockholders
from time to time as permitted by Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by the Commission
then in effect) on the terms and conditions specified in this <U>Section 6.01</U> and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but in any event
no later than the earlier of (i) sixty (60) days (or one hundred twenty (120) days if the Commission notifies the Company that

after the date the Company is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the Commission that such Registration Statement
will not be &ldquo;reviewed&rdquo; or will not be subject to further review (such earlier date, the &ldquo;Effectiveness Deadline&rdquo;).
The Registration Statement filed with the Commission pursuant to this <U>Section 6.01</U> shall be on Form S-1 or such other form
of registration statement as is then available to effect a registration for resale of such Registrable Securities, covering such
Registrable Securities, and shall contain a Prospectus in such form as to permit any Stockholder to sell such Registrable Securities
pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by the Commission then in effect)
at any time beginning on the effective date for such Registration Statement. A Registration Statement filed pursuant to this <U>Section
6.01</U> shall provide for the resale pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally available to, and requested by,
the Stockholders. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this <U>Section
6.01</U> to remain effective, and to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement
is available or, if not available, that another registration statement is available, for the resale of all the Registrable Securities
held by the Stockholders until all such Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities. As soon as practicable
following the effective date of a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this <U>Section 6.01</U>, but in any event within three
(3) Business Days of such date, the Company shall notify the Stockholders of the effectiveness of such Registration Statement.
When effective, a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this <U>Section 6.01</U> (including any documents incorporated therein
by reference) will comply as to form in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any Prospectus contained in such Registration Statement,

any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the
indemnifying party&rsquo;s and indemnified party&rsquo;s relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such action&#894; provided, however, that the liability of any Stockholder under this <U>Section 6.05(e)</U>
shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Stockholder in such offering giving rise to such liability.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include,
subject to the limitations set forth in <U>Sections 6.05(a), (b)</U> and <U>(c)</U> above, any legal or other fees, charges or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it
would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection <U>Section 6.05(e)</U> were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this
<U>Section 6.05(e)</U>. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities
Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this <U>Section 6.05(e)</U> from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.</FONT></P>
