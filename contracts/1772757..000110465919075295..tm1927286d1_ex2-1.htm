Company (" _DTC_ "), using DTC's Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian System to the
Earnout Escrow Agent (as defined below), the number of shares of New DK Class
A Common Stock that formerly constituted DEAC Shares (the " _Former Founder
Shares_ ") that is six million (6,000,000) _less_ the number of SBT Earnout
Shares to be held in escrow in accordance with this _Section 1.8_; and (ii)
forfeit and deliver to New DK for cancellation the number of Former Founder
Shares equal to the number of SBT Earnout Shares, following which New DK shall
(A) cancel such forfeited Former Founder Shares and (B) issue such number of
new shares of New DK Class A Common Stock constituting the SBT Earnout Shares,
of which such number of SBT Earnout Shares which are subject to the 104H Tax

to the 104H Tax Ruling (the " _104H Trustee_ ") in accordance with this
_Section 1.8_ _and the remaining SBT Earnout Shares shall be held with the
Earnout Escrow Agent_. Three million (3,000,000) of such Former
Founder Shares described in the preceding clause (i), as may be adjusted for
any stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization, exchange, subdivision or combination, shall
be allocated on a Pro Rata Basis among the DEAC Founder Group (the " _DEAC
Earnout Shares_ "), and the remainder of such Former Founder Shares (i.e., the
DK Earnout Shares) together with the SBT Earnout Shares, as such shares may
be adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization, exchange, subdivision or combination, shall
be allocated as follows: (x) the SBT Earnout Shares shall be allocated on a
Pro Rata Basis among the SBT Sellers (the " _SBT Earnout Group_ "), and (y)
the DK Escrowed Earnout Shares shall be allocated on a Pro Rata Basis among
the DK Stockholders and holders of Exchanged DK Options as of

number of DK Earnout Shares and SBT Earnout Shares shall be three million
(3,000,000), as may be adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization, exchange, subdivision or
combination.

  



  

(b) _Procedures Applicable to the Earnout of the Earnout Shares_.

  



  

(i) Upon receipt of the Earnout Shares, an escrow agent (the "
_Earnout Escrow Agent_ ") will place such Earnout Shares in an escrow account
(the " _Earnout Escrow Account_ ") established pursuant an escrow agreement in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to DK, DEAC and the SBT Sellers'
Representative, to be entered into at the Closing by New DK, the DEAC Founder
Group, the SBT Sellers' Representative and the Earnout Escrow Agent (the "
_Earnout Escrow Agreement_ "); provided, that the SBT Earnout Shares owned by
any Israeli member of the SBT Earnout Group shall be deposited with the 104H
Trustee pursuant to a trust agreement to be entered with the 104H Trustee
(the " _Trust Agreement_ ") to the extent requested by such member of the SBT
Earnout Group.

(ii) Promptly upon the occurrence of any triggering event
described in _Section 1.8(c)_ below, or as soon as practicable after any
party becomes aware of the occurrence of such triggering event or receives
written notice of a triggering event from the DEAC Founder Group or the SBT
Sellers' Representative, New DK shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be
prepared and delivered, in consultation with the DEAC Founder Group and the
SBT Sellers' Representative, a mutually agreeable written notice to each of
the Earnout Escrow Agent and, if applicable, the 104H Trustee (each a "
_Release Notice_ "), which Release Notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail the triggering event giving rise to the requested release and the
specific release instructions with respect thereto (including the number of
Earnout Shares to be released and the identity of the person to whom they
should be released). New DK, the DEAC Founder Group and the SBT Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the SBT Sellers) shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve any disputes that may arise between any of them with respect to the
determination of the occurrence of a triggering event and the preparation of
the applicable Release Notice. In the event New DK, the DEAC Founder Group and
the SBT Sellers' Representative are unable to reach mutual agreement with
each other with respect to the preparation of a Release Notice, all
unresolved disputed items shall be promptly referred to an impartial
nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants
appointed by mutual agreement of New DK, the DEAC Founder Group and the SBT
Sellers' Representative (the " _Independent Accountant_ "). If such
Independent Accountant is not appointed within seven (7) Business Days from
the date on which New DK, the DEAC Founder Group or the SBT Sellers'
Representative has asked in writing to appoint one, the Parties shall draw
lots to determine the Independent Accountant, provided that it shall be the
New York main office of one of the "big 5" accounting firms. The Independent
Accountant shall be directed to render a written report on the unresolved
disputed items with respect to the applicable triggering event and related
Release Notice as promptly as practicable and to resolve only those
unresolved disputed items. New DK, the DEAC Founder Group and the SBT Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the SBT Sellers) shall each furnish to the
Independent Accountant such work papers, schedules and other documents
and information relating to the unresolved disputed items as the Independent
Accountant may reasonably request. The Independent Accountant shall resolve
the disputed items based solely on the terms and conditions in this Agreement
and the presentations made on behalf of New DK, the DEAC Founder Group and
the SBT Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the SBT Sellers) and not by
independent review. The resolution of any such dispute by the Independent
Accountant shall be final and binding on the parties hereto absent manifest
error in its determination in which case the matter will be brought back to
the Independent Accountant for correction no more than one time by a Party
after which the determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final and
binding. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne
equally by New DK, the DEAC Founder Group, DK Stockholder Group and the SBT
Sellers (provided, that the total amount paid out-of-pocket by each of the
DEAC Founder Group and the SBT Sellers in respect of such fees and expenses
shall be one-third of such fees and expenses).

  



  

(iii) The DEAC Earnout Shares that are to be released from the
Earnout Escrow Account and distributed to the DEAC Founder Group shall
be distributed to each member of the DEAC Founder Group on a Pro Rata Basis.
The DK Earnout Shares that are to be released from the Earnout Escrow
Account, as applicable, and distributed to each member of the DK Earnout
Group, shall be distributed to each member of the DK Earnout Group on a Pro
Rata Basis. The SBT Earnout Shares that are to be released from the Earnout
Escrow Account or by the 104H Trustee (subject to the requirements of the
104H Tax Ruling), as applicable, and distributed to each member of the SBT
Earnout Group, shall be distributed to each member of the SBT Earnout Group on
a Pro Rata Basis.

  



  

(iv) Subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, as may be
applicable, the holders of the Earnout Shares shall not, directly or
indirectly, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or
similarly dispose of, either voluntarily or involuntarily, any of the Earnout
Shares until the date on which the relevant vesting triggers have been
satisfied as described in _Section 1.8(c)_ below and such shares have been
released to the members of the DEAC Founder Group, the DK Earnout Group and
SBT Earnout Group entitled thereto.

  



  

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, no additional shares of capital
stock of New DK will be placed in the Earnout Escrow Account or with the 104H
Trustee for release or issuance pursuant to this _Section 1.8_, and upon
release of all of the Earnout Shares in the Earnout Escrow Account and with
the 104H Trustee in accordance with this _Section 1.8_, the Earnout Escrow
Agreement and Trust Agreement shall terminate pursuant to their terms and the
provisions of this _Section 1.8_ shall no longer have any force or effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Earnout Shares not eligible to be released
from the Earnout Escrow Account or by the 104H Trustee in accordance with the
terms of _Section 1.8(c)_ after the lapse of the four (4)-year anniversary
of the Closing Date shall thereafter be forfeited to New DK and cancelled and
no member of the DEAC Founder Group, the DK Earnout Group or the SBT Earnout
Group shall have any rights with respect thereto.

the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property
having a value equaling exceeding $12.50 per share (for any non-cash proceeds,
as determined based on the agreed valuation set forth in the applicable
definitive agreements for such transaction or, in the absence of such
valuation, as determined in good faith by the New DK Board of Directors);

  



  

(ii) one-third of the Earnout Shares of each Earnout Recipient
will be released from the Earnout Escrow Account or by the 104H Trustee

Weighted Average Share Price equals or exceeds $16.00 per share for twenty
(20) of any thirty (30) consecutive trading days commencing after the Closing
on the NASDAQ or any other national securities exchange or (B) if New DK
consummates a transaction which results in the stockholders of New DK having
the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property
having a value equaling or exceeding $16.00 per share (for any non-cash
proceeds, as determined based on the agreed valuation set forth in the
applicable definitive agreements for such transaction or, in the absence of
such valuation, as determined in good faith by the New DK Board of Directors).

  



  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, if the condition for more than one
triggering event is met pursuant to _Section 1.8(c)_, then all of the
Earnout Shares to be released and distributed in connection with each such
triggering event shall be released and delivered to the Earnout Recipients in

Article II 
 CONVERSION OF DK SECURITIES

  



  

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock of DK and Merger Sub_. At
the DK Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the DK Merger and without any
action on the part of DK, New DK, Merger Sub or the holder of any DK Shares:

  



  

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common
stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.001 per share, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the DK Merger Effective Time shall be converted into one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Company,
par value $0.001 per share.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Certain DK Common Stock_. Each DK Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the DK Merger Effective Time that
is owned or held by DK in treasury, DEAC, SBT or by any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically
canceled and shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of All Other DK Common Stock_. Each share of DK
Class A Common Stock (including shares of DK Preferred Stock converted to DK
Common Stock in connection with the DK Preferred Share Conversion and re-
designated as shares of DK Class A Common Stock in accordance with _Section
1.6(b)_) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the DK Merger Effective
Time, other than any Cancelled Shares, shall be converted into the right to
receive (i) such number of shares of duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable New DK Class A Common Stock (the " _DK Merger
Consideration_ ") equal to the number that is the quotient of (I) (A) US$
2,055,241,409, _divided by_ (B) the sum of (i) the number of all outstanding
shares, as of immediately prior to the Closing, of DK Common Stock and DK
Preferred Stock (assuming their conversion to shares of DK Common Stock)
_plus_ (ii) the number of shares of DK Common Stock to be issued assuming the
exercise of all DK Options and DK Warrants that are vested as of immediately
prior to the Closing, on a net exercise basis as of the Closing Date,
_divided by_ (II) the DEAC Liquidation Value (the " _DK Share Exchange Ratio_
") (and the aggregate number of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock to be
received by each holder of DK Class A Common Stock, as a result of applying
the DK Share Exchange Ratio shall be rounded down or up to the nearest whole
number); and (ii) a right to receive Earnout Shares, if and as determined
pursuant to _Section 1.8_; provided, however, that each DK Stockholder that
is a Non-Accredited Investor shall not receive the DK Merger Consideration in
the form of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock and shall instead receive
cash in an amount equivalent to the value of the shares of New DK Class A
Common Stock as of the Closing Date that such DK Stockholder would have
otherwise received. By way of example, assuming the capitalization of DK,
SBT and DEAC as set forth in _Schedule 1_ , the DK Share Exchange Ratio would
be 0.3574. Each share of DK Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the DK Merger Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive the same number of shares of duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable New DK Class B Common Stock.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of DK Certificates and DK Book-Entry
Shares_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the DK Merger Effective Time, DK
and DEAC shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the aggregate DK
Merger Consideration in accordance with this  _Section 2.2_. At or
immediately following the DK Merger Effective Time, New DK shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent the number of shares of New DK
Class A Common Stock comprising the aggregate DK Merger Consideration in
respect of (i) certificates that immediately prior to the DK Merger Effective
Time represented DK Shares (" _DK Certificates_ ") and (ii) non-certificated
outstanding DK Shares represented by book entry (" _DK Book-Entry Shares_ "),
in each case other than Cancelled Shares, and the number of shares of New DK
Class B Common Stock to be issued in accordance with Section 1.6(b), for
exchange in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ through the Exchange Agent
(collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the aggregate DK Merger Consideration
contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the DK Merger
Effective Time, New DK shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each record holder of a DK Certificate or DK Book-Entry Share, in
each case which shares were converted into the right to receive the DK Merger
Consideration in respect thereof at the DK Merger Effective Time pursuant to
this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the DK Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the DK Certificates to the Exchange Agent,
and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as DK, New
DK and the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the DK Certificates or DK Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the aggregate DK Merger Consideration in respect thereof, as
applicable. Upon surrender of DK Certificates and DK Book-Entry Shares for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form with all required enclosures
and attachments, with respect to such DK Certificates or DK Book-
Entry Shares, the holder of such DK Certificates or DK Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive the DK Merger Consideration for each share of DK
Common Stock formerly represented by such DK Certificates or such DK Book-
Entry Shares. Any DK Certificates and DK Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of any DK Merger Consideration is to
be made to a person other than the person in whose name any surrendered DK
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent to payment that
the DK Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
delivery of the aggregate DK Merger Consideration in respect thereof, as
applicable, to a person other than the registered holder of the DK Certificate
so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of New DK that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Delivery of
the aggregate DK Merger Consideration, as applicable, with respect to DK Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such DK Book-
Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each DK
Certificate or DK Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the DK
Merger Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the aggregate DK
Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

  



  

(c) _Transfer Books_. At the DK Merger Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of DK shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of DK Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the DK Merger Effective Time on the records of DK. From and after the DK
Merger Effective Time, the holders of DK Certificates and DK Book-Entry Shares
representing DK Shares outstanding immediately prior to the DK Merger
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
DK Merger Effective Time, DK Certificates representing DK Shares are
presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the aggregate DK Merger Consideration in respect thereof as
provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property_. At any
time following one (1) year after the Closing Date, New DK shall be
entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares of New DK
Common Stock remaining in the Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange
Agent and not delivered to holders of DK Certificates or DK Book-Entry Shares,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to New DK (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the aggregate DK Merger Consideration payable upon
due surrender of their DK Certificates or DK Book-Entry Shares and compliance
with the procedures in this _Section 2.2_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither New DK, the Surviving Company nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable
to any holder of a DK Certificate or DK Book-Entry Shares for any DK Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any DK Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed DK
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the aggregate DK Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that New DK or the
Exchange Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such aggregate DK Merger Consideration, require
the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed DK Certificates to deliver a
customary indemnity against any claim that may be made against New DK, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent with respect to the DK Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

(f) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the DK Merger
Effective Time with respect to the New DK Shares with a record date after the
DK Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered DK
Certificate or DK Book-Entry Share with respect to the New DK Shares issuable
in respect thereof unless and until the holder of such DK Certificate or DK
Book-Entry Share shall surrender such DK Certificate or DK Book-Entry Share.
Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such DK Certificate or DK Book-Entry Share, there shall
be paid by New DK to the holder of whole shares of New DK Class A Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the DK Merger
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of New DK
Class A Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the DK Merger
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after
surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of New DK Class A Common
Stock.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Treatment of DK Options and Warrants_.

  



  

(a) _Treatment of DK Options._ At the DK Merger Effective Time,
each DK Option (as defined below) that is outstanding immediately prior
to the DK Merger Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to represent an option to purchase DK Shares (a " _DK Option_
") under the DK Stock Plans and shall be converted into (i) an option to
purchase a number of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock (such option, an "
_Exchanged DK Option_ ") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest
whole number) of (x) the number of DK Shares subject to such DK Option
immediately prior to the DK Merger Effective Time and (y) the DK Share
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per DK Share of such DK Option
immediately prior to the DK Merger Effective Time divided by (B) the DK Share
Exchange Ratio and (ii) a right to receive Earnout Shares, if and as
determined pursuant to Section 1.8; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
exercise price and the number of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to the Exchanged DK Options shall be determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any Exchanged DK Option to which
Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares
of New DK Class A Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be
determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as
are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the DK Merger
Effective Time, each Exchanged DK Option shall continue to be governed by the
same terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as

(b) _DK Actions._ At or prior to the DK Merger Effective Time,
DK, the DK Board and the compensation committee of the DK Board, as
applicable, shall (i) adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are
necessary to effectuate the treatment of the DK Options pursuant to _Section
2.3(a)_ and (ii) take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the
DK Merger Effective Time neither New DK nor the Surviving Company will be

listing of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock as necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.3_. If registration of shares
of New DK Class A Common Stock under the DK Stock Plans is required under the
Securities Act, New DK shall file with the SEC as promptly as practicable
after the date that is sixty (60) days following the Closing Date (or
any such earlier date permitted by applicable Law) a registration statement
on Form S-8 with respect to such shares of New DK Class A Common Stock, and

effect and such registration of the shares of New DK Class A Common Stock
issuable thereunder continues to be required.

  



  

(d) At the DK Merger Effective Time, New DK shall assume the DK
Stock Plans, except that the DK Stock Plans (and any option
agreement thereunder) shall be amended at the DK Merger Effective Time to
conform with the requirements of _Section 2.3(a)_ and to include additional
amendments required to comply with any Law applicable to New DK (the "
_Assumed DK Stock Plans_ "). New DK shall be entitled to grant stock-based
awards under the Assumed DK Stock Plans to the extent permissible under
applicable Law and the terms thereof, using the share reserve of the DK Stock
Plans as of the DK Merger Effective Time (including any shares subsequently
returned to the share reserve as a result of the termination of awards issued
under the DK Stock Plans), except that: (A) shares covered by such awards
shall be shares of New DK Class A Common Stock, with the rights and subject to
the limitations of such shares of New DK Class A Common Stock issuable under
New DK's equity incentive plan as in effect from time to time; (B) all
references in the DK Stock Plans to a number of DK Shares shall be deemed
amended to refer instead to a number of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of referenced DK Shares by the DK Share
Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number up or down to the nearest
whole number; (C) New DK's board of directors or an applicable committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the DK Board or
any duly authorized committee thereof with respect to the administration of
the Assumed DK Stock Plans; and (D) the Assumed DK Stock Plans shall be
subject to administrative procedures consistent with those in effect under New
DK's equity incentive plans as in effect from time to time.

  



  

(e) _Treatment of DK Warrants_. At the DK Merger Effective Time,
each DK Warrant that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
DK Merger Effective Time and not terminated pursuant to its terms, by virtue
of the DK Merger and without any action on the part of New DK, DK or the
holder of any such DK Warrant, shall be converted into a warrant exercisable
for the DK Merger Consideration which such holder would have received if it
had exercised such DK Warrant immediately prior to the DK Merger Effective
Time (assuming such DK Warrants were then fully vested).

  



  

Section 2.4 _DK Preferred Stock Conversion_. DK shall take all
actions necessary to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of DK
Preferred Stock into shares of DK Common Stock (the "DK Preferred Stock
Conversion") as of immediately prior to the DK Merger Effective Time.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Wage Payments_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any cash amount needs to be
paid to any employee or former employee of DK or SBT (or any of their
subsidiaries) that constitutes "wages", such amount shall be deposited (in
case of SBT, by the Paying Agent) in the payroll account of the applicable
entity and the amounts due to the employee (net of withholding) shall be paid
to the employee pursuant to the next scheduled payroll of the applicable
entity (except that payments to an Israeli Optionee, shall be made through
the 102 Trustee).

Paying Agent for the purchase of the issued SBT Shares of each SBT Seller and
all of the Cashed-Out SBT Options shall be the sum of:

  



  

(i) a cash amount of € 180,000,000 (the " _SBT Cash Amount_ ");
_plus_

  



  

(ii) the Actual SBT Net Debt Amount (it being understood that if
the Actual SBT Net Debt Amount is a negative amount (i.e., the Cash
Balances of SBT and its Subsidiaries as at the date and time set out in the
definition of Actual SBT Net Debt Amount are less than the Indebtedness of
SBT and its Subsidiaries as at the date and time set out in the definition of
Actual SBT Net Debt Amount), the absolute value of the Actual SBT Net Debt
Amount will be deducted from the SBT Cash Amount, and if the Actual SBT Net
Debt Amount is a positive amount (i.e., the Indebtedness of SBT as at the
date and time set out in the definition of Actual SBT Net Debt Amount is less
than the Cash Balances of SBT and its Subsidiaries as at the date and time
set out in the definition of Actual SBT Net Debt Amount) the Actual SBT Net
Debt Amount will be added to the SBT Cash Amount); _plus or minus_

  



  

(iii) the SBT Working Capital Adjustment; _plus_

  



  

(iv) the Aggregate Strike Price Amount; _plus_

  



  

(v) the Collected Amount Purchase Price (which will be payable to

(the aggregate amount being the " _SBT Cash Consideration_ ").

  



  

(b) Out of the SBT Cash Consideration, each of the SBT Sellers
shall be entitled to an amount equal to (i) the Cash Price Per SBT Share
multiplied by a number that equals thirty percent (30%) of all SBT Shares sold

the Cashed-Out SBT Options Exercise Price Per SBT Share multiplied by a number

Options shall, in accordance with _Section 3.3(a)_, be entitled to an amount
that equals (i) the Cash Price Per SBT Share for each Cashed-Out SBT Option
multiplied by the number of SBT Shares exercisable under such SBT
Optionee's Cashed-Out SBT Options, less (ii) the aggregate exercise price per
SBT Share of all of Cashed-Out SBT Options of such SBT Optionee.

  



  

(c) In addition to the SBT Cash Consideration, at the Closing, New
DK shall (i) allot and issue to each of the SBT Sellers (or a trustee on
their behalf, including any trustee appointed pursuant to the 104H Tax Ruling)
such number of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock equal to the result of
multiplying such SBT Seller's aggregate number of issued SBT Shares held by
such SBT Seller immediately prior to the Closing by the SBT Share Exchange
Ratio (and the result being rounded down or up to the nearest whole number)
(the " _SBT Consideration Shares_ ") and together with the SBT Cash

in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.2(a)(ii)_; and (iii) grant
the SBT Sellers a right to receive Earnout Shares, if and as determined
pursuant to _Section 1.8_.

Section 3.2 _SBT Closing Deliveries._

  



  

(a) _ _SBT Consideration__.

  



  

(i) _SBT Cash Consideration._ On the Closing Date, New DK shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent (for payment by the
Paying Agent to the SBT Sellers and holders of Cashed-Out SBT Options) as the
cash portion of the consideration for the purchase of the SBT Shares of each
SBT Seller and all of the Cashed-Out SBT Options the following amount in
Euros:

  



  

A. the SBT Cash Amount; _plus_

  



  

B. the Estimated SBT Net Debt Amount (it being understood that if
the Estimated SBT Net Debt Amount is a negative amount (i.e., the
Cash Balances of SBT and its Subsidiaries estimated pursuant to _Section
3.2(b)_ are less than the Indebtedness of SBT estimated pursuant to _Section
3.2(b)_, the absolute value of the Estimated SBT Net Debt Amount will be
deducted from the SBT Cash Amount, and if the Estimated SBT Net Debt Amount
is a positive amount (i.e., Indebtedness of SBT estimated pursuant to
_Section 3.2(b)_ is less than the Cash Balances of SBT and its Subsidiaries
estimated pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_) the Estimated SBT Net Debt Amount
will be added to the SBT Cash Amount); _plus_ or _minus_

  



  

C. the Estimated SBT Working Capital Adjustment; _minus_

  



  

D. the Escrow Amount; _minus_

  



  

E. the Adjustment and Expense Fund; _plus_

  



  

F. the Aggregate Strike Price Amount.

  



  

(the aggregate amount being " _Initial SBT Cash Consideration_ ").

  



  

In addition, at the Closing, New DK shall pay (i) to the Escrow Agent the
Escrow Amount (payable in US$ based on the Euro-US$ average exchange rate for
the consecutive seven (7) Business Day period ending on the fifth (5th)
Business Day prior to the Closing (as such exchange rate shall be published
by Bloomberg Terminal on NASDAQ at market close at the end of each of such
seven (7) Business Days)) to be held by it in accordance with the terms of
the _Section 3.6_ and the Escrow Agreement, and (ii) to the Paying Agent (in
its capacity as the Adjustment and Expense Fund agent) the Adjustment and
Expense Fund in Euros, to be held by it in accordance with the terms of
_Section 3.4_ and the Paying Agent Agreement.

  



  

Each SBT Seller's entitlement in the Initial SBT Cash Consideration shall be
an amount equal to (i) the SBT Closing Cash Price Per SBT Share multiplied by
a number that equals thirty percent (30%) of all SBT Shares sold by such SBT
Seller pursuant to this Agreement, plus (ii) an amount equal to the Cashed-
Out SBT Options Exercise Price Per SBT Share multiplied by a number that
equals thirty percent (30%) of all SBT Shares sold by such SBT Seller
pursuant to this Agreement. The entitlement of each SBT Optionee in the
Initial SBT Cash Consideration in respect of such SBT Optionee's Cashed-Out
SBT Options, shall be an amount equal to (i) the SBT Closing Cash Price Per
SBT Share for a Cashed-Out SBT Option multiplied by the number of such SBT
Optionee's Cashed-Out SBT Options, less (ii) the aggregate exercise price per
SBT Share of all of the Cashed-Out SBT Options of such SBT Optionee. The SBT
Sellers' Representative shall calculate the portion of Initial SBT Cash
Consideration to which each SBT Seller and holder of Cashed-Out SBT Options
is entitled in accordance with the terms of this _Section 3.2(a)_ and shall
accordingly indicate in the applicable tables in _Section 3.2(a)_ of the SBT
Disclosure Letter, the names of the applicable SBT Security Holders and their
entitlement in such consideration against each such Security Holder's name,
and deliver to DEAC and to DK such tables not later than seven (7) days prior
to the Closing Date and upon the delivery of such tables, they will
be regarded as being part of this Agreement.

(ii) _SBT Consideration Shares._ In addition to the payment of
the Initial SBT Cash Consideration in respect of the SBT Shares of each SBT
Seller and all of the Cashed-Out SBT Options, on the Closing Date, New DK
shall allot and issue to each SBT Seller (or to a trustee on their behalf,
including any trustee appointed pursuant to the 104H Tax Ruling) for the
purchase of the SBT Shares of such SBT Seller, such number of SBT
Consideration Shares to which such SBT Seller is entitled in accordance with
_Section 3.1(c)_, which SBT Consideration Shares shall be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free from Encumbrances
(other than as contemplated in New DK's Organizational Documents), ranking
pari passu with all other shares of New DK Class A Common Stock and with the
right to receive all dividends, returns of capital and other benefits declared
to the holders of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock, paid or made by New
DK on or after the issuance thereof, and issued to the SBT Sellers with full
title guarantee and have such rights as set out in New DK's Organizational
Documents. At Closing, each SBT Optionee (or a trustee on its behalf) shall,
in respect of his or her Rolled-Over SBT Options, be allocated a number of New
DK Options in accordance with _Section 3.3(b)_. By way of example, assuming
that the capitalization of DK, SBT and DEAC is as set forth in _Schedule 1_ ,
the SBT Share Exchange Ratio would be 998.5. The SBT Sellers' Representative
shall calculate the number of SBT Consideration Shares and New DK Options to
be issued or allocated to the applicable SBT Security Holders in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 3.2(a)(ii)_ and shall accordingly indicate
in the applicable tables set out in Section 3.2(a)(ii) of the SBT Disclosure
Letter, the names of the applicable SBT Security Holders and their entitlement
in the SBT Consideration Shares or New DK Options, as applicable, and deliver
to DEAC and to DK such tables not later than seven (7) days prior to the
Closing Date, and upon the delivery of such tables, they will be regarded as
being part of the Agreement. In addition to the above, SBT Sellers shall have
a right to receive Earnout Shares, if and as determined pursuant to _Section
1.8._

  



  

(iii) Wherever in this Agreement provision is made for the payment
by one party to another (or to a third party on its behalf), such payment
shall be made by crediting for same day value the account specified in the
Payment Account Details (such Payment Account Details to be notified in
writing by the payee to the payor prior to the due date for payment) of the
party entitled to the payment by way of telegraphic transfer on or before the
due date for payment. Payment of such sum shall be a good discharge to the
payer of its obligation to make such payment.

  



  

(iv) If any payment is made by any SBT Security Holder to New DK
in respect of any claim under this Agreement or any agreement entered into
pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any indemnity hereunder or
thereunder, the payment shall be made by way of a reduction of the
consideration paid by New DK which shall, to the extent possible, be deemed to
have been reduced by the amount of such payment.

  



  

(b) _ _Calculation of Initial SBT Cash Consideration__.

  



  

Not less than five (5) Business Days (and not more than ten (10) Business
Days) prior to the Closing Date, the SBT Sellers' Representative shall notify
DK and DEAC of:

  



  

A. the Estimated SBT Net Debt Amount;

  



  

B. the Estimated SBT Working Capital Adjustment;

  



  

C. the Aggregate Strike Price Amount; and

  



  

D. its calculation of the Initial SBT Cash Consideration,

  



  

in each case, together with such documentation as may support such estimates.

  



  

Thereafter, DK and the SBT Sellers' Representative shall consult with one
another with respect to the determination of the amounts contemplated in
_Section 3.2(b)_, and the SBT Sellers' Representative, having taken account
of DK's comments in good faith, shall, not less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, determine and notify DK of any changes in such
amounts, if any, which absent fraud and manifest error shall be final for
purposes of _Section 3.2(b)_.

Section 3.3 _Treatment of SBT Options_. The following provisions
shall apply to SBT Options which are outstanding and in effect immediately
prior to the Closing:

  



  

(a) At the Closing, thirty percent (30%) of the Vested SBT Options
held by each SBT Optionee (other than any Out-of-the-Money Vested
SBT Options) that are outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (the "
_Cashed-Out SBT Options_ "), shall be cashed out on a cashless exercise
basis, such that each such Cashed-Out SBT Option shall automatically, and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled
and be with no further force and effect and automatically converted into the
right of the holder thereof to receive for each such Cashed-Out SBT Option
its Cash Price Per SBT Share less the exercise price per SBT Share of such
Cashed-Out SBT Option. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, SBT Sellers' Representative, DEAC and DK shall agree in good faith
to a form of option waiver letter pursuant to which each holder of Cashed-Out
SBT Options shall acknowledge and agree to the treatment of his or her
Cashed-Out SBT Options under this Agreement (the " _SBT Option Waiver Letter_
") and as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, SBT shall deliver a
SBT Option Waiver Letter to each holder of Cashed-Out SBT Options and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to have each holder of Cashed-out SBT
Options execute such SBT Option Waiver Letter prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set out in this Agreement, each
holder of Cashed-Out SBT Options shall be entitled to receive, when and if
payable as contemplated in this Agreement, such SBT Optionee's applicable
portion of the SBT Cash Consideration, upon delivery by such SBT Optionee to
New DK of a duly executed and completed SBT Option Waiver Letter, in
accordance with the instructions thereto, it being understood and agreed that
each reference in this Agreement to any payment of SBT Cash Consideration in
respect of a Cashed-Out SBT Option shall be deemed subject to the condition
that the applicable SBT Optionee has delivered a duly executed and completed
SBT Option Waiver Letter pursuant to this  _Section 3.3(a)_.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

(b) All SBT Options (other than the Cashed-Out SBT Options),
including all Unvested SBT Options, Out-of-the-Money Vested SBT Options
and all Vested SBT Options which are not Cashed-Out SBT Options, which are
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, the "
_Rolled-Over SBT Options_ "), shall automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent an option to
purchase SBT Shares and shall be converted into an option to purchase a number
of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock (such option, an " _Exchanged SBT
Option_ ") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
(x) the number of SBT Shares subject to such Rolled-Over SBT Option
immediately prior to the Closing and (y) the SBT Share Exchange Ratio, at an
exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A)
the exercise price per SBT Share of such Rolled-Over SBT Option immediately
prior to the Closing divided by (B) the SBT Share Exchange Ratio; _provided_
, _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of New DK Class
A Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Exchanged SBT Options shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any Exchanged SBT
Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the
number of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock purchasable pursuant to
such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to
such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided in this _Section
3.3(b)_, following the Closing, each Exchanged SBT Option shall continue to
be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting
schedule, same original vesting commencement date and exercisability terms)
as were applicable to the corresponding former Rolled-Over SBT Option
immediately prior to the Closing DK Merger Effective Time, and the terms of
the SBT Plan and any option agreement governing such Rolled-Over SBT Options
shall be deemed amended so that a "Transaction" (as such term is defined and
used in the SBT Plan) is no longer a condition for the exercise of any such
Exchanged SBT Options assumed pursuant to this _Section 3.3(b)_. Each SBT
Optionee may, at its discretion, concurrently at the Closing or thereafter,
exercise any of its vested Exchanged SBT Options into shares of New DK Class
A Common Stock, subject to applicable Law, the terms of the SBT Plan and the
option agreements relating thereto (in each case, after giving effect to this
_Section 3.3(b)_).

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, SBT shall take (or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiary to take) all actions and issue all notices, in each
case necessary, and shall use (or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to
use) reasonable efforts to obtain any consent required (including making any
amendments necessary to the SBT Plan or any applicable option agreement), to
effect the transactions anticipated by this _Section 3.3_ with respect to
all SBT Options, as required under the SBT Plan, any other plan, any option
award agreement or other arrangement of SBT or any of its Subsidiaries
(whether written or oral, formal or informal) governing the terms of any SBT
Options or applicable Law (including, without limitation, all actions
necessary to ensure that from and after the Closing, no SBT Shares or other
capital stock of SBT or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to be issued
or delivered to any person pursuant to or in settlement of SBT Options). As
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, SBT shall instruct its
Israeli legal counsel, advisors and/or accountants to prepare and file with
the ITA, in coordination with DK's and DEAC's legal counsel, advisors and/or
accountants, an application for the Option Tax Ruling, and if SBT reasonably
anticipates that the Option Tax Ruling will not be granted prior to Closing,
SBT shall instruct its Israeli legal counsel, advisors and/or accountants to
prepare and file with the ITA, in full coordination with DK's and DEAC's
legal counsel, advisors and/or accountants, an application for the Interim
Option Ruling. Each of SBT, DK and DEAC shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate, including to instruct their respective legal counsel,
advisors and accountants to coordinate all activities, and to cooperate with
each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of such application
and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Option Tax Ruling or
the Interim Option Ruling, it being understood that the Option Tax Ruling,
the Interim Option Ruling and any written or oral submissions relating thereto
shall be in a form approved in good faith by DK; provided that such approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed so long as DK and
its advisors are provided with a copy of, and have a reasonable period of
time to review and comment on, the Option Tax Ruling, the Interim Option
Ruling and any related submission, as applicable, and SBT considers and
implements such comments in good faith. To the extent the Interim Option
Ruling is obtained, all references in this Agreement (other than in this
_Section 3.3(c)_) to the Option Tax Ruling shall be deemed to refer to such
interim ruling, until such time that a final definitive Option Tax Ruling
is obtained.

(d) _New DK Actions_.

  



  

(i) New DK (and for the avoidance of doubt, prior to Completion
DEAC) shall take all actions that are reasonably necessary for the
assumption of the Rolled-Over SBT Options pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_
including the reservation, issuance and listing of shares of New DK Class A
Common Stock as necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 3.3_. If registration of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock
under the SBT Plan is required under the Securities Act, New DK shall file
with the SEC as promptly as practicable after the date that is sixty (60)
days following the Closing Date (or any such earlier date permitted by
applicable Law) a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to such
shares of New DK Class A Common Stock, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so
long as the SBT Plan remains in effect and/or for as long as such
registration of the shares of New DK Class A Common Stock issuable
thereunder continues to be required. Without derogating from the generality
of the above, such action will include, the assumption by New DK of the
Rolled-Over SBT Options held by Israeli Optionees in order that, with respect
to Israeli Optionees, as of the Closing Date, the capital gains route of
Section 102 of the ITO shall apply to such Israeli Optionees in accordance
with the applicable requirements of applicable Law and the Interim Option
Ruling or Option Tax Ruling with respect to their Exchanged SBT Options
(such steps to include, assuming the SBT Plan as a share incentive plan under
the capital gains route of Section 102 of the ITO, filing any applicable
notices regarding the assumption of the SBT Plan by New DK/DEAC with the ITA
and depositing the Rolled-Over SBT Options which are assumed by New DK under
this _Section 3.3_ and held by Israeli Optionees with the 102 Trustee in
accordance with the requirements and provisions of the Interim Option Ruling
and/or Option Tax Ruling and Section 102 of the ITO). Prior to the Closing,
SBT and its Subsidiaries, SBT Sellers' Representative, DK and DEAC (together
with their respective counsel, advisors and/or accountants) shall examine
whether any other action is required or desirable with respect to the
treatment under this _Section 3.3_ of any SBT Options held by any SBT
Optionees who are not Israeli Optionees and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take such actions which are necessary to eliminate or minimize any
adverse Tax effect that may be incurred by such SBT Optionees, New DK and its
post-Closing Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions contemplated in this
_Section 3.3_ (which measures may include paying any SBT Cash Consideration
with respect to the Cashed-Out SBT Options through the payroll of their
employing companies, after making such deductions and withholding as required
by applicable Law by such employers).

  



  

(ii) At the Closing, New DK shall assume the SBT Plan, except that
the SBT Plan (and any option agreement under it) shall be amended at the
Closing to conform with the requirements of _Section 3.3(b)_ and to include
additional amendments required to comply with any Law applicable to New DK,
in a form to be agreed in good faith between SBT Sellers' Representative and
DK prior to Completion (the " _Amended Plan_ "). New DK shall be entitled to
grant stock-based awards under the Amended Plan to the extent permissible
under applicable Law and the terms thereof, using the share reserve of the SBT
Plan as of the Closing (including any shares subsequently returned to the
share reserve as a result of the termination of awards issued under the
SBT Plan), except that: (A) shares covered by such awards shall be shares of
New DK Class A Common Stock, with the rights and subject to the limitations
of such shares of New DK Class A Common Stock issuable under New DK's equity
incentive plan as in effect from time to time; (B) all references in the SBT
Plan to a number of SBT Shares shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a
number of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock determined by multiplying the
number of referenced SBT Shares by the SBT Share Exchange Ratio, and rounding
the resulting number up or down to the nearest whole number; (C) New DK's
board of directors or an applicable committee thereof shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of SBT's board of directors or any duly
authorized committee thereof with respect to the administration of the Amended
Plan; and (D) the Amended Plan shall be subject to administrative procedures
consistent with those in effect under New DK's equity incentive plans as in
effect from time to time.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Paying Agent; Post-Closing Adjustments_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the SBT Sellers' Representative shall
enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_
") pursuant to which the SBT Sellers' Representative and New DK shall jointly
appoint the Paying Agent to act as agent for the SBT Sellers and the
applicable SBT Security Holders in connection with the Transactions: (i)
to receive any payment to which the applicable SBT Security Holders may be
entitled pursuant to this Agreement, including their applicable portions of
the Initial SBT Cash Consideration, as it may be adjusted, the Actual
Adjustment Amount, the Collected Amount Purchase Price and any indemnity
amount pursuant to _Article X_, and (ii) to hold and disburse as an
adjustment and expense fund agent, the Adjustment and Expense Fund in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 3.4_ and the Paying Agent
Agreement. The allocation of any consideration payable to the SBT Security
Holders by the Paying Agent among such SBT Security Holders shall be in
accordance with a funds allocation table to be prepared and updated by the SBT
Sellers' Representative from time to time and submitted to the Paying Agent.
The Paying Agent Agreement shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to DK and DEAC. All costs and expenses relating to the Paying
Agent shall be paid by the SBT Security Holders (including any such costs
and expenses borne by SBT or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing).

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

(b) On the Closing Date, an amount of cash representing the Cash
Transaction Percentage in the Adjustment and Expense Fund in respect of each
SBT Seller and each holder of Cashed-Out SBT Options shall be deposited with
and held in the Adjustment and Expense Fund by the Paying Agent in accordance
with the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement and _Section 3.2(a)_. The
Adjustment and Expense Fund shall be held by the Paying Agent and invested as
determined by the SBT Sellers' Representative (acting on behalf of the SBT
Sellers and the holders of Cashed-Out SBT Options) from time to time at his
sole discretion and in accordance with the terms of the Paying Agent
Agreement. The Adjustment Fund Amount and any interest and profit accrued
thereon are for the use by the SBT Sellers' Representative to first pay (on
behalf of the applicable SBT Security Holders) any Actual Adjustment
Amount to New DK, if applicable pursuant to _Section 3.4(d)_. The Expense
Fund Amount (and following the Adjustment Fund Release Date, also the
Adjustment Fund Amount), may be used at SBT Sellers' Representative sole
discretion, to pay any costs, fees, indemnities and other expenses of the SBT
Security Holders pursuant to this Agreement or of the SBT Sellers'
Representative, to the extent they are related to the performance by the SBT
Sellers' Representative of his duties and obligations hereunder, on behalf of
the SBT Security Holders. Amounts shall be disbursed from the Adjustment and
Expense Fund in accordance with written instructions from the SBT Sellers'
Representative to the Paying Agent from time to time and at any time at the
SBT Sellers' Representative sole discretion, except that the Adjustment Fund
Amount (or any portion thereof) may be so disbursed only following the
Adjustment Fund Release Date. The outstanding balance of the Adjustment and
Expense Fund shall be distributed by the Paying Agent to the SBT Sellers and
the holders of Cashed-Out SBT Options at such time and for time to time, as
determined by the SBT Sellers' Representative at his sole discretion, except
that the Adjustment Fund Amount may be so distributed only following the
Adjustment Fund Release Date. The portion of the Adjustment and Expense Fund
amount allocable to each SBT Seller and holder of Cashed-Out SBT Options
shall be determined by multiplying the aggregate amount distributed to SBT
Sellers and holders of Cashed-Out SBT Options from the Adjustment and Expense
Fund by such SBT Seller's or holder's Cash Transaction Percentage.
All amounts in the Adjustment and Expense Fund shall be held by the Paying
Agent exclusively for the benefit of the SBT Sellers and the holders of
Cashed-Out SBT Options, and neither DEAC, DK nor any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives shall have any interest, right, Encumbrance or
claim in respect of the Adjustment and Expense Fund and any amounts held
therein, except that New DK may claim against the release of the Adjustment
Fund Amount or any portion thereof, to the extent that any amount in
the Adjustment Fund Amount is disbursed to any person other than New DK prior
to the Adjustment Fund Release Date. Neither DEAC, DK nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall be allowed to take any action with respect to, or
grant to any person any right with respect to, the Adjustment and Expense
Fund and any amounts held therein, or instruct the SBT Sellers'
Representative, the Paying Agent or any other person regarding any actions to
take with respect to the Adjustment and Expense Fund and any amounts held
therein, or prevent or delay any payment of any amounts therefrom to any
person, other than the right of New DK to claim against any payment from the
Adjustment Fund Amount to any person other than New DK, prior to the
Adjustment Fund Release Date.

  



  

(c) If the amount (the " _Actual Adjustment Amount_ ") that equals
(a) the Actual SBT Working Capital _plus_  (b) the Actual SBT Net Debt
Amount, exceeds the amount (the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_ ") that
equals (x) the Estimated SBT Working Capital, _plus_ (y) the Estimated SBT
Net Debt Amount, New DK shall, on the date falling not later than five (5)
Business Days following the last date on which both the SBT Net Debt Statement
and SBT Working Capital Statement become final and binding in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 3.5_, pay in Euros to the Paying Agent (for the
benefit of the SBT Sellers and the holders of the Cashed-Out SBT Options) an
amount equal to such excess. Any Actual Adjustment Amount distributed by the
Paying Agent to the SBT Sellers and the holders of the Cashed-Out SBT Options
shall be distributed to each SBT Seller and holder of Cashed-Out SBT Options
based on its or his Cash Transaction Percentage.

  



  

(d) If the Actual Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated
Adjustment Amount, the SBT Sellers' Representative shall instruct the Paying
Agent to pay on behalf of each SBT Seller and holder of Cashed-Out SBT Options
(each in respect of his, her or its Cash Transaction Percentage) on the date
falling not later than five (5) Business Days following the last date on which
both, the SBT Net Debt Statement and SBT Working Capital Statement, become
final and binding in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.5_, from
the Adjustment and Expense Fund in Euros to New DK an amount equal to such
shortfall (it being understood that to the extent such shortfall between the
Actual Adjustment Amount and the Estimated Adjustment Amount exceeds the
amount then held in the Adjustment and Expense Fund, such excess shall be
severally paid by the SBT Sellers and holders of Cashed-Out SBT Options each
in respect of his, her or its Cash Transaction Percentage of such shortfall).

  



  

(e) Any payments made from the Adjustment and Expense Fund to New
DK in accordance with this _Section 3.4_ shall be treated as an adjustment
to the SBT Consideration.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

Section 3.5 _Preparation of Working Capital Statement and Net
Debt Statement_.

  



  

(a) New DK shall within forty five (45) days after Closing prepare
and deliver to the SBT Sellers' Representative (i) a draft of the SBT Working
Capital Statement (the " _Draft SBT Working Capital Statement_ ") and (ii) a
draft of the SBT Net Debt Statement (the " _Draft SBT Net Debt Statement_ "),
each prepared in accordance with the general and specific accounting
principles and treatments set forth in _Section 3.5_ of the SBT Disclosure
Letter.

  



  

(b) The SBT Sellers' Representative shall notify New DK within
thirty (30) days of receipt of the Draft SBT Working Capital Statement and
the Draft SBT Net Debt Statement whether or not it accepts either (or any
portion thereof) for the purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) In order to enable the SBT Sellers' Representative to review
the Draft SBT Working Capital Statement and the Draft SBT Net Debt Statement,
New DK shall make available to the SBT Sellers' Representative and to the
representatives and accountants of the SBT Sellers' Representative (i)
relevant books and records necessary for the confirmation of the Draft SBT
Working Capital Statement and Draft SBT Net Debt Statement (and the
calculations set out therein) and (ii) employees of SBT and its
Subsidiaries as the SBT Sellers' Representative may reasonably request to
assist the SBT Sellers' Representative with regard to acceptance of or
objection to the Draft SBT Working Capital Statement and Draft SBT Net Debt
Statement or any portion thereof.

  



  

(d) If the SBT Sellers' Representative notifies New DK within the
period specified in _Section 3.5(b)_ above that it does not accept the Draft
SBT Working Capital Statement and/or the Draft SBT Net Debt Statement:

  



  

(i) it shall set out in reasonable detail in such notice (the "
_Disagreement Notice_ ") its reasons for non-acceptance (together with such
supporting information as may be reasonably necessary to support the reasons
stated) and specify the adjustments which, in its reasonable opinion, should
be made to the Draft SBT Working Capital Statement and/or the Draft SBT Net
Debt Statement in order to comply with the requirements of this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) the SBT Sellers' Representative and New DK shall attempt in
good faith, to reach agreement in respect of the Draft SBT Working Capital
Statement and/or the Draft SBT Net Debt Statement and, if they are unable to
do so within thirty (30) days following receipt by New DK of the Disagreement
Notice, the SBT Sellers' Representative or New DK may by notice to the other
require that the Draft SBT Working Capital Statement and/or the Draft SBT Net
Debt Statement be referred to the Reporting Accountants (an "
_Appointment Notice_ "); and

  



  

(iii) except for the matters specifically set out in the
Disagreement Notice, the SBT Sellers' Representative shall be deemed to
have agreed the Draft SBT Working Capital Statement and the Draft SBT Net
Debt Statement in full.

  



  

(e) If the SBT Sellers' Representative is satisfied with the Draft
SBT Working Capital Statement and/or the Draft SBT Net Debt Statement (either
as originally submitted by New DK or after adjustments agreed in writing
between New DK and the SBT Sellers' Representative) or if the SBT Sellers'
Representative fails to notify New DK of its non-acceptance of the Draft SBT
Working Capital Statement and/or the Draft SBT Net Debt Statement within the
thirty (30) day period referred to in _Section 3.5(b)_ above, then the Draft
SBT Working Capital Statement and/or the Draft SBT Net Debt Statement
(incorporating any agreed adjustments) shall constitute the final and binding
SBT Net Debt Statement and/or SBT Working Capital Statement for the purposes
of this Agreement.

  



  

  

   

20

 



    



  

(f) If an Appointment Notice is given under _Section 3.5(d)(i)_
above, the Reporting Accountants shall be engaged jointly by the SBT Sellers'
Representative and New DK on the terms set out in this _Section 3.5_ and
otherwise on such terms as shall be agreed in writing by the SBT Sellers'
Representative and New DK. If the terms of engagement of the
Reporting Accountants have not been settled within thirty (30) days of their
identity having been determined (or such longer period as the SBT Sellers'
Representative and New DK may agree in writing) then, unless the SBT Sellers'
Representative or New DK is unreasonably refusing its agreement to these
terms, those accountants shall be deemed never to have become the Reporting
Accountants and new Reporting Accountants shall be selected in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

  

(g) The Reporting Accountants shall determine their own procedure,
subject to the following:

  



  

(i) New DK or New DK's accountants and the SBT Sellers'
Representative or the SBT Sellers' Representative's accountants shall each
promptly (and in any event within thirty five (35) days of a relevant
appointment) submit a written statement on the matters in dispute (together
with relevant supporting documents) to the Reporting Accountants for
determination and shall each, simultaneously with the delivery, instruct the
Reporting Accountants to promptly deliver a copy of their respective written
statement to the other party;

  



  

(ii) following delivery of their respective submissions, New DK
and the SBT Sellers' Representative shall have the opportunity to
comment once only (provided that nothing in this _Section 3.5(g)(i)_ shall
prevent the parties from responding to any requests from the Reporting
Accountants under _Section 3.5(h)_ below) on the other party's submissions by
written comment delivered to the Reporting Accountants not later than twenty
(20) days (the " _Last Comments Date_ ") after the written statement was
first submitted to the Reporting Accountants and copied to the other party
pursuant to _Section 3.5(g)_ above;

  



  

(iii) apart from procedural matters and/or as otherwise set out in
this Agreement, the Reporting Accountants shall determine only:

  



  

A. whether any of the arguments for an alteration to the Draft
SBT Working Capital Statement and/or the Draft SBT Net Debt Statement put
forward in the Disagreement Notice is correct in whole or in part; and

  



  

B. if so, what alterations should be made to the Draft SBT
Working Capital Statement and/or the Draft SBT Net Debt Statement in order to
correct the relevant inaccuracy in it and the result of the Reporting
Accountants' determination may be only within the range between New DK's
position in the Draft SBT Working Capital Statement and/or the Draft SBT Net
Debt Statement, as applicable, and the SBT Sellers' Representative's position
in his Disagreement Notice in respect of such statements;

  



  

(iv) the Reporting Accountants shall make their determination in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and apply the policies set out in
_Section 3.5_ of the SBT Disclosure Letter;

  



  

(v) the Reporting Accountants shall make their determination
pursuant to _Section 3.5(g)(ii)_ above within thirty (30) days of the Last
Comments Date, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible, and such
determination shall be in writing and shall be made available for collection
by the SBT Sellers' Representative and New DK at the offices of the Reporting
Accountants and shall (unless otherwise agreed by the SBT Sellers'
Representative and New DK in writing) include reasons for each
relevant determination;

  



  

(vi) the Reporting Accountants shall act as experts (and not as
arbitrators) in making their determination, and their determination of
any matter falling within their jurisdiction shall be final, binding and non-
appealable on the SBT Sellers' Representative and New DK, and without
prejudice to any other rights which they may respectively have under this
Agreement with respect to all other matters, the parties waive, to the extent
permitted by Law, any rights of recourse they may otherwise have to challenge
it (except in the event of: (i) fraud in the determination of the Reporting
Accountants, in which case the determination shall be referred to different
Reporting Accountants and matters shall be re-evaluated in accordance with the
procedures in this _Section 3.5_; or (ii) manifest error in good faith in
the determination of the Reporting Accountants, in which case such error may
be referred back to the Reporting Accountants only for correction of such
error and the terms of this _Section 3.5_ shall apply to such correction);

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(vii) the Reporting Accountants shall not be entitled to determine
the scope of their own jurisdiction; and

  



  

(viii) the charges and expenses of the Reporting Accountants shall be
borne as between New DK on the one hand and the SBT Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of all of the SBT Sellers) on the other hand in the
same proportion as any determination made by the Reporting
Accountants pursuant to _Section 3.5(g)(ii)_ above as determined by the
Reporting Accountants (except that each shall bear VAT thereon to the extent
that VAT is attributable to supplies made to it by the Reporting Accountants).
For example, if New DK's position is that an Actual Adjustment Amount of €
100,000 is required to be paid to New DK pursuant to _Section 3.4_ and this
_Section 3.5_, and the SBT Sellers' Representative's position is that the
Actual Adjustment Amount is zero, and the Reporting Accountants' final
determination provides that an Actual Adjustment Amount of € 70,000
is required to be paid by the SBT Security Holders to New DK pursuant to
_Section 3.4_ and this _Section 3.5_, then New DK shall bear 30% of the
charges and expenses of the Reporting Accountants and the SBT Security Holders
shall bear 70% of such charges and expenses. Other than pursuant to this
_Section 3.5_ each party shall bear its own costs and expenses pursuant to
this _Section 3.5_.

  



  

(h) The SBT Sellers' Representative and New DK shall cooperate
with the Reporting Accountants and comply with their reasonable requests made
in connection with the carrying out of their duties under this Agreement.
Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, New DK shall keep up to
date and, subject to reasonable notice, make available to the SBT Sellers'
Representative's representatives, the SBT Sellers' Representative's
accountants and the Reporting Accountants relevant books and records relating
to SBT and its Subsidiaries and access to their applicable employees, in each
case during Working Hours during the period from the appointment of the
Reporting Accountants to the making of the relevant determination.

  



  

(i) Any determination of the Reporting Accountants under _Section
3.5(g)(ii)_ above shall (subject to _Section 3.5(g)(iv)_) be deemed to be
incorporated into the Draft SBT Working Capital Statement and/or the Draft SBT
Net Debt Statement which, as adjusted by the alterations so determined by the
Reporting Accountants (if any), shall then become the SBT Working Capital
Statement and the SBT Net Debt Statement and be final and binding on the SBT
Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the SBT Sellers and the holders of the
Cashed-Out SBT Options) and New DK.

  



  

(j) Nothing in this _Section 3.5_ shall entitle a Party or the
Reporting Accountants access to any information or document which is
protected by legal professional privilege, or which has been prepared by the
other party or its accountants and other professional advisers with a view to
assessing the merits of any claim or argument, provided that a party shall not
be entitled by reason of this _Section 3.5(j)_ to refuse to supply such part
or parts of documents as contain only the facts on which the relevant claim
or argument is based.

  



  

(k) Each Party shall, and shall procure that its accountants,
representatives and other advisers shall, and shall instruct the
Reporting Accountants to, keep all information and documents provided to them
pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ confidential and shall not use them for any
purpose, except for disclosure or use in connection with the preparation of
the Draft SBT Working Capital Statement and/or the Draft SBT Net Debt
Statement, the proceedings of the Reporting Accountants or any other matter
arising out of this Agreement or in defending any claim or argument or
alleged claim or argument relating to this Agreement or its subject matter.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Escrow and Lockup Shares_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing, New DK the SBT Sellers' Representative (acting
on behalf of the SBT Sellers and the holders of Cashed-Out SBT Options) and
the Escrow Agent shall enter into an escrow agreement (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ ") in form and substance reasonably acceptable to DK, DEAC and the
SBT Sellers' Representative. At the Closing, New DK shall transfer the Escrow
Amount to the Escrow Agent to be held in the Escrow Account pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement and this _Section 3.6_. No amount shall be
released from the Escrow Account other than in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement and this _Section 3.6_. New DK and the SBT Sellers, respectively,
shall each pay one half of the Escrow Agent's costs in respect of any work
done pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and this _Section 3.6_.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(b) Following the Closing, the Escrow Amount, together with any
interest accrued thereon (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") shall be held in the Escrow
Account in accordance with the terms of this _Section 3.6_ and the Escrow
Agreement. Any interest that accrues on the credit balance of the Escrow
Account from time to time shall be credited to the Escrow Account. Each of the
SBT Sellers and the holders of Cashed-Out SBT Options shall be the beneficial
owners of their respective Cash Transaction Percentages of the Escrow Fund
and any interest on any amount in the Escrow Account.

  

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Parties shall cooperate and work
together in good faith to calculate, and shall within two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing determine and agree, the number of shares of New DK Class
A Common Stock that would constitute an aggregate value of US$ 45,000,000 at
the Closing (taking into account the DEAC Liquidation Value), which shares
shall be allocated from the SBT Sellers and the SBT Optionees, pro rata in
accordance with their respective expected ownership of shares of (i) New DK
Class A Common Stock (received as SBT Share Consideration) as of immediately
following the Closing and (ii) shares of New DK Class A Common Stock
underlying their New DK Options granted to them at the Closing in respect of
their Rolled-Over SBT Options, using the treasury stock method (collectively
and as may be reduced pursuant to _Section 3.6(g)_, the " _Lockup Shares_ ",
and the aggregate number of Lockup Shares as of the Closing Date, the "
_Closing Date Lockup Shares_ "). Beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
the date that is five (5) years following the Closing Date (the " _Lockup End
Date_ " or " _Final Release Date_ "), each SBT Security Holder shall not
without the prior written consent of New DK, directly or indirectly, (x)
offer, sell, offer to sell, contract to sell, hedge, pledge, sell any option
or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any
option, right or warrant to purchase or sell (or announce any offer, sale,
offer of sale, contract of sale, hedge, pledge, sale of any option or contract
to purchase, purchase of any option or contract of sale, grant of any option,
right or warrant to purchase or other sale or disposition), or otherwise
transfer or dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is
designed to, or could reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition by
any person at any time in the future), any Lockup Shares acquired pursuant to
the Agreement or (y) enter into any swap or other agreement or any
transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the
economic consequence of ownership of any Lockup Shares, whether or not any
such swap or transaction described in clause (x) or (y) above is to be
settled by delivery of any Lockup Shares, but except in each case of (x) or
(y), in the event of a transfer or sale as a result of a merger or sale of
all or substantially all of the shares of New DK or similar transactions or
arrangements effected by operation of law or pursuant to the Organizational
Documents of New DK or by an agreement or arrangement approved by the Board of
New DK or its Stockholders (a " _Permitted Transfer_ "), in which case and
notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, all
Lockup Shares at that time shall cease to be restricted pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 3.6(c)_, immediately prior to the closing of any
such transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a SBT Security Holder (a "
_Transferor_ ") may transfer his or its Lockup Shares or any rights in
respect of them to: a person or entity who (i) as of the date of
this Agreement, wholly owns such Transferor, (ii) is wholly owned by such
Transferor, (iii) is wholly owned by the same person or entity who wholly
owns such Transferor as of the date of this Agreement, in each case of
(i)-(iii), whether directly or indirectly, or (iv) is an immediate family
member of such Transferor or to a trust the sole beneficiaries of which are
such Transferor and/or his immediate family members, _provided_ that in each
case of the preceding clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), the transferee
undertakes in writing to the benefit of New DK to be bound by the lockup
provisions of this _Section 3.6_ (in so far as they relate to the Lockup
Shares transferred to such transferee) as if such transferee was the
Transferor. Lockup Shares shall be transferable by operation of law
(including as a result of the death or bankruptcy of an SBT Security
Holder). For the avoidance of doubt, (i) any transferees or assignees
(including heirs or other transferees by operation of law) of Lockup Shares
transferred as permitted by the immediately preceding two sentences (other
than transferees pursuant to a Permitted Transfer) shall be subject to the
lockup provisions of this _Section 3.6(c)_; and (ii) the SBT Security
Holders and their transferees and assigns shall continue to enjoy the
economic benefits of any Lockup Shares held during the period in which the
above lockup provisions apply, including the right to receive any dividends
distributed on such Lockup Shares. The Parties agree that, if requested by
the SBT Sellers' Representative prior to the Closing, including if such
request is in light of adverse tax consequences potentially applying as a
result of the above lock-up arrangement to any SBT Optionee or a group of
them, then such SBT Optionee(s) shall be excluded from the provisions of this
_Section 3.6(c) _and the number of Lockup Shares of each of the other SBT
Security Holders shall be increased on a pro-rata basis among them (based on
their holdings in the SBT Consideration Shares or shares of New DK Class A
Common Stock underlying the New DK Options at Closing, as applicable), such
that the aggregate number of Lockup Shares intended to be locked up pursuant
to the terms of this Section 3.6(c) at the Closing shall remain the same.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

(d) Subject to the limitations on liability set forth in this
Agreement (including in Article X), if there is determined to be any
Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 10.2_ (including any breach of a
SBT Representation and any Seller Taxes), (i) the amount of the then-
remaining funds in the Escrow Fund may be claimed against by New DK as the
first recourse with respect to any and all such Losses; (ii) second, if the
amount of the then-remaining funds in the Escrow Fund is insufficient to
satisfy in full any amounts owing to New DK in respect of any such Losses,
then New DK shall have recourse for such Losses against the then outstanding
Lockup Shares (based on the Market Value of the Lockup Shares at the relevant
time), pro rata from each SBT Security Holder in respect of and based on the
number of Lockup Shares held by each such SBT Security Holder, and (iii)
third, only in the event of (x) a breach of any SBT Fundamental
Representations or the SBT Sellers Fundamental Representations or (y)
any Seller Taxes, where and after the Escrow Fund and the Lockup Shares have
been exhausted, the SBT Security Holders, severally (based on his
CashTransaction Percentage), in case of a breach of a SBT Fundamental
Representation or any Seller Taxes, or the applicable SBT Seller with respect
to the breach of his or its specific SBT Sellers Fundamental Representation,
as applicable, shall be liable for Losses in respect of such claim for breach
of such Fundamental Representations and the SBT Sellers Fundamental
Representations for the amount of Losses in excess of the amount of the
Escrow Fund and the value of the Lockup Shares (but the SBT Security
Holders' aggregate liability for such breach, together with their liability
for all other matters pursuant to this Agreement, shall in no event, exceed
the SBT Consideration actually received by them).

  



  

(e) If a Notified Claim arises and is Resolved on or before the
Final Release Date, the SBT Sellers' Representative and New DK shall, as soon
as is practicable (and in any even within five (5) Business Days of the
Notified Claim being Resolved), save to the extent that a payment of the
amount due in respect of that Notified Claim has been made from other funds,
(i) instruct the Escrow Agent to release to New DK from the Escrow Account

Registration Statement and sent to the DEAC stockholders of relating to the
DEAC Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement/prospectus, together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "). DEAC
shall file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (ii) the Registration
Statement, which shall include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, in connection
with the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of New DK Class
A Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Transactions. Each of DEAC,
DK, SBT and the SBT Sellers will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to (i) cause the Registration Statement, when filed, to comply in all
material respects with all legal requirements applicable thereto, (ii)
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to and resolve all comments
received from the SEC or its staff concerning the Registration Statement,
(iii) have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and (iv) keep the
Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to complete the
Transactions. DEAC shall set a record date (the " _DEAC Record Date_ ") for

the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act.

  



  

(b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration
Statement, or response to SEC comments with respect thereto, will be made by
DEAC without the prior written consent of DK and the SBT Sellers'
Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

review and comment thereon.

  



  

(c) DEAC will promptly notify the other Parties upon the receipt

all material correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect
to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus received from
the SEC and advise the other on any oral comments with respect to the
Registration Statement received from the SEC. DEAC will advise the
other parties, promptly after DEAC receives notice thereof, of the time of
effectiveness of the Registration Statement and the issuance of any stop
order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the shares of

circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or (ii) the Proxy

stockholders and at the time of the DEAC Stockholders Meeting contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. If at any time prior to the Closing any information relating
to DEAC, DK or SBT, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, is discovered by DEAC, DK or SBT which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
each of DEAC, DK and SBT shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information to be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated

of such recommendation in a manner adverse to DK, SBT or the SBT Sellers (an
" _Adverse Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , that DEAC may only postpone or
adjourn the DEAC Special Meeting (w) to seek withdrawals of redemption
requests from DEAC's stockholders if DEAC reasonably expects the payments for
the DEAC Share Redemption would cause the condition in Section 11.1(h) to not
be satisfied at the Closing, (x) to solicit additional proxies for the
purpose of obtaining the DEAC Stockholder Approvals, (y) for the absence of a
quorum and (z) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing

under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by DEAC Stockholders prior to the DEAC Special
Meeting.

  



  

Section 9.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to
applicable Law, each of the Parties shall afford to the others and their
respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
during the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated to all of
its and its Subsidiaries' properties, books, Contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and, during such period, and each of the Parties shall
furnish promptly to the other, consistent with its legal obligations, all
information concerning the party and its Subsidiaries' business,
properties and personnel as another Party or any of its Representatives may
reasonably require for the purposes of this Agreement or post-
Closing integration planning; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Party may
restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any applicable Law or any
Contract to which it is a party, requires it to restrict access to any
properties or information or in order to maintain attorney-client or other
privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that in any such case, the applicable
Parties shall cooperate to seek to provide for access in a manner that does
not violate any such Law or Contract or attorney-client or other privilege.
Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreements, each of the Parties shall hold, and shall cause its
Representatives to hold, all information received from the other party,
directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with and otherwise
subject to the applicable Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant
to this _Section 9.3_ or information provided, made available or delivered
pursuant to this Agreement will affect or be deemed to modify any of the
representations or warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement or
the conditions hereunder to the obligations of the Parties hereto.

Section 9.4 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each Party agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Transactions, subject to the express provisions of this
Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations,
filings and notifications (including filings or notifications with
Governmental Authorities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an adverse action or proceeding
by, any Governmental Authority (including in connection with the HSR Act and
any other applicable Competition Laws or as required by or advisable
with respect to Gaming Regulatory Authorities), (iii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Party subject to the applicable
requirement of a Governmental Authority or party to the applicable agreement
requiring a consent or waiver shall be primarily responsible
for communications with the applicable Governmental Authority or other third
party while keeping the other Parties informed and the other Parties hereto
shall reasonably cooperate in such efforts.

  



  

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, DK
shall with respect to DK, DEAC shall with respect to DEAC, and the SBT
Sellers shall with respect to SBT, make or cause to be made any appropriate
filings or notifications, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act or other
applicable Competition Laws and any appropriate filings or notifications as
required by or advisable with respect to Gaming Regulatory Authorities, in
each case with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable (and in
any event no later than (A) fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement with respect to filings by DK and DEAC under the HSR Act and (B)
twenty (20) Business Days with respect to notifications or submissions to or
filings by DK and SBT with the Gaming Regulatory Authorities as set forth on
Section 9.4(b) of the DK Disclosure Letter and Section 9.4(b) of the SBT
Disclosure Letter, unless otherwise mutually agreed among the Parties). For
purposes of the notifications, submissions and filings described in the
immediately preceding sentence of this Section 9.4(b), "Business Day" with
respect to each shall mean a day, other than a day on which commercial banks
in the jurisdiction of the applicable Gaming Regulatory Authority are
authorized or required by Law to close. Each Party will furnish to the other
Parties such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental
filings, notifications or other submissions and will cooperate in responding
to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority and to any requests for
additional information at the earliest practicable date, including promptly
informing the other Parties of such inquiry, consulting in advance (and
considering in good faith such other Party's views) before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority and
promptly supplying the other Parties with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between any Party and any
Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions.
Such information can be shared on an outside counsel basis or subject to
other restrictions to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by counsel for
the disclosing party. To the extent permitted by a Governmental Authority,
each Party hereto shall permit Representatives of the other Parties (or
counsel of that Party on confidential basis in case of sensitive information
being deliberated) to participate in material substantive meetings (whether by
telephone or in person) with such Governmental Authority. Each Party shall
use its reasonable best efforts and closely collaborate on the timing,
strategy and approach to (x) obtain any consents, approvals, authorizations or
orders required to be obtained by such party or any of their respective
Subsidiaries under the HSR Act or other applicable Competition Laws or as
required by or advisable with respect to Gaming Regulatory Authorities, (y)
avoid the entry of any judgment in any claim asserted in court by any
Governmental Authority under any Competition Laws or Applicable Gaming Laws
that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing or the ability of New DK to
operate the businesses of DK and SBT and their respective Subsidiaries
following the Closing as conducted immediately prior to the Closing in all
material respects or (z) contest or avoid any action, proceeding or litigation
by any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or other applicable
Competition Laws or Applicable Gaming Laws.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
9.4_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to require
any Party to agree to, or take any action if such efforts or action,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a
material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of
operations of DK, SBT or New DK (immediately following the Closing) (each of
such actions, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). None of the Parties nor any of
its respective Subsidiaries shall take any action that has the effect of, or
agree with any Governmental Authority to, a Burdensome Condition without the
prior written consent of the other Parties hereto.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Indemnification; Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, New DK shall or shall cause DK or
SBT, as applicable, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
provide advancement of expenses to, the current and former directors and
officers of DK and its Subsidiaries and of SBT and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), in each case in their respective capacities as such
and to the fullest extent permitted by Law, including to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL
adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which a
corporation or limited liability company may indemnify its officers and
directors or any Indemnified Party, from and against any and all costs or
expenses (including attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
regulatory or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any circumstances, developments or matters in existence, or acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to occur at or prior to the Closing (including
for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement, the performance of such party's obligations under this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions or arising out of or pertaining to
the Transactions) whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Closing.

  



  

(b) It is understood and agreed that all rights to
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation existing in favor of each
present and former director, officer and employee of DK or any of its
Subsidiaries and of SBT and any of its Subsidiaries, as provided in their
respective Organizational Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, or under any other agreements in effect on the date of this
Agreement (true, correct and complete copies of which have been delivered by
DK and SBT, as applicable, to the other Parties hereto), will survive the
Transactions and New DK shall cause DK and SBT to (i) continue in full
force and effect for a period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date
(or, if any relevant claim is asserted or made within such six (6) year
period, until final disposition of such claim) such rights to indemnification
and expense advancement and (ii) perform, in a timely manner, DK's, or its
Subsidiaries' and SBT's or its Subsidiaries' obligations with respect
thereto. Any claims for indemnification and expense advancement pursuant to
such agreements and organizational documents as to which DK or SBT has
received written notice before the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date
will survive, whether or not those claims will have been finally adjudicated
or settled, and no action taken during such period may be deemed to diminish
the obligations set forth in this _Section 9.5(b)_.

  



  

(c) For at least six (6) years after the Closing, DK and SBT shall
maintain (and New DK shall cause DK and SBT to maintain) in effect DK's and
SBT's current directors' and officers' liability insurances in respect of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Transactions) covering the Indemnified Parties
currently covered by DK's or SBT's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy, on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that DK or SBT, as applicable, may
substitute therefor a tail policy or policies of DK or SBT containing terms
with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable to such Indemnified
Parties. The covenants contained in this _Section 9.5(c)_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal Representatives, and shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

Section 9.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth on Section 9.6
of the DEAC Disclosure Letter (which expenses shall be borne by New DK
following the Closing) or Section 9.6 of the SBT Disclosure Letter (which
expenses shall be borne by New DK following the Closing) or as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (including their legal
and accounting fees in respect of the Transaction and their investment banker
fees), shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses.

  



  

Section 9.7 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Closing, DEAC, DK
and SBT shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other
the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Transactions, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any securities exchange or securities
quotation system. The Parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in the form
heretofore agreed by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, DEAC, DK and
SBT may, without the prior consent of the other Parties,
reasonably disseminate information with respect to the Transactions to the
extent such information was previously included in a press release or other
public statement made pursuant to this _Section 9.7_.

  



  

Section 9.8 _Stockholder Litigation_. In the event that any
stockholder litigation related to this Agreement or the Transactions is
brought, or, to the Knowledge of DEAC, threatened in writing, against DEAC or
the members of its boards of directors prior to the Closing, DEAC shall
promptly notify the other Parties of any such stockholder litigation brought,
or, to the Knowledge of DEAC, threatened against DEAC and/or members of the
DEAC Board and shall keep the other Parties reasonably informed with respect
to the status thereof. Neither DEAC nor any Subsidiary or Representative of
DEAC shall settle or agree to settle any such stockholder litigation or
consent to the same unless DK and SBT shall have consented in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditional or delayed).

  



  

Section 9.9 _NASDAQ Listing_. Prior to the Closing, DEAC, DK and SBT
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of New DK Class
A Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Transactions to be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ under a ticker symbol to be mutually
agreed upon in writing by the Parties, including by submitting prior to the
Closing an initial listing application with the NASDAQ (the " _NASDAQ Listing
Application_ ") with respect to such shares, subject to official notice of
issuance. Each of DEAC, DK, SBT and the SBT Sellers shall promptly furnish all
information concerning itself and its Affiliates as may be reasonably
requested by the other Parties and shall otherwise reasonably assist and
cooperate with the other Parties in connection with the preparation, filing
and distribution of the NASDAQ Listing Application. Each of DEAC, DK, SBT and
the SBT Sellers will use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i)
cause the NASDAQ Listing Application, when filed, to comply in all material
respects with all legal requirements applicable thereto, (ii) respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to and resolve all comments received from
the NASDAQ or its staff concerning the NASDAQ Listing Application and (iii)
have the NASDAQ Listing Application approved by the NASDAQ as promptly as
practicable after such filing. No submission of, or amendment or supplement
to, the NASDAQ Listing Application, or response to NASDAQ comments with
respect thereto, will be made by DEAC, DK or SBT, as applicable, without the
other Parties' prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and without providing such other Parties a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. Each of DEAC, DK and SBT will
promptly notify the other Parties upon the receipt of any comments from the
NASDAQ or any request from the NASDAQ for amendments or supplements to the
NASDAQ Listing Application and will, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, provide the other with copies of all material correspondence between
it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the NASDAQ, on the other
hand, and all written comments with respect to the NASDAQ Listing Application
received from the NASDAQ and advise the other on any oral comments with
respect to the NASDAQ Listing Application received from the NASDAQ. DEAC will
advise DK and SBT, promptly after DEAC receives notice thereof, of the time
of the approval of the NASDAQ Listing Application and the approval of the
shares of New DK Class A Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
Transactions for listing on the NASDAQ, subject only to official notice of
issuance.

Section 9.10 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that (i) the employees of DK and its
Subsidiaries at the DK Merger Effective Time who continue to remain
employed with DK or its Subsidiaries (the " _DK Continuing Employees_ ") and
(ii) the employees of SBT and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time who
continue to remain employed with SBT or its Subsidiaries (the " _SBT
Continuing Employees_ ") shall, during the one (1) year period commencing on
the Closing Date, be provided with compensation and benefits that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to such DK Continuing
Employees or SBT Continuing Employees, as applicable, immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that the requirements of this sentence
shall not apply to DK Continuing Employees or SBT Continuing Employees who
are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

  



  

(b) With respect to any Benefit Plan in which any DK Continuing
Employee or SBT Continuing Employee (collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") first becomes eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting
periods under any of its group health plans, if any, to be waived with
respect to the other Party's Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents, (ii) give the other Party's Continuing Employees credit for the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs (or the plan year in which the
Continuing Employee first becomes eligible to participate in the applicable
Benefit Plan, if later) towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-
pocket limits for medical expenses incurred during the plan year but prior to
the Effective Time (or eligibility date, as applicable), for which payment
has been made and (iii) give the other Party's Continuing Employees
service credit for such Continuing Employee's employment with the other Party
for purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to participate under
each applicable Benefit Plan, as if such service had been performed with such
Party, except for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for
purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits (unless
otherwise required under applicable Law) or to the extent it would result in
a duplication of benefits.

  



  

(c) The Parties agree that the unallocated option pool of SBT
(referred to in item (b) of Section 4.2(c) of the SBT Disclosure Letter),
following its conversion into unallocated option pool of New DK based on the
SBT Share Exchange Ratio pursuant to _Section 3.3_, shall exclusively serve,
following the Closing, for grants of New DK Options to SBT's and its
Subsidiaries' employees and consultants as of immediately prior to Closing
who are continuing to be employed or engaged by SBT and its Subsidiaries
(or New DK and its Subsidiaries) following the Closing (the " _SBT Grantees_
") and not to any other person. The CEO and SBT Sellers' Representative shall
jointly determine the identity of such SBT Grantees and their entitlement in
such unallocated pool whether, prior to the Closing or shortly thereafter,
and New DK shall effect such grants promptly following such
determination (but not prior to the Closing).

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated
as an amendment of any particular DK Benefit Plan or SBT Benefit Plan, (ii)
prevent DK, SBT, New DK or any of their Affiliates from amending or
terminating any of their respective Benefit Plans in accordance with their
terms, (iii) prevent DK, SBT, New DK or any of their Affiliates, after the DK
Merger Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any Continuing
Employee or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of
DK, SBT, New DK or any of their Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent
thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to
the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may
be provided to any DK Continuing Employee or SBT Continuing Employee by DK,
SBT, New DK or any of their Affiliates or under any Benefit Plan which DK,
SBT, New DK or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Certain SBT Receivables_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing, the SBT Sellers' Representative (acting on
behalf of the SBT Sellers) shall, and SBT and New DK shall allow and
reasonably cooperate with (and cause the pre-Closing Subsidiaries of SBT to
allow and reasonably cooperate with) the SBT Sellers' Representative (at the
sole expense of the SBT Sellers) to, collect on behalf of SBT and its pre-
Closing Subsidiaries, all Excluded Receivables. In this regard, SBT shall
(and New DK shall cause SBT and its pre-Closing Subsidiaries to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist the SBT Sellers' Representative in
such collection efforts with respect to the Excluded Receivables
(including providing to the SBT Sellers' Representative any information
reasonably necessary for the purpose of collecting the Excluded Receivables)
and promptly informing (subject to obligations of confidentiality) the SBT
Sellers' Representative of the receipt of any amount in respect of the
Excluded Receivables and of any correspondence regarding the same if any such
amounts or correspondence is received by New DK, SBT or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of any amount in
respect of the Excluded Receivables by New DK or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Closing (each, a " _Collected Amount_ "), New DK
shall pay or cause the payment of an amount which is equal to such Collected
Amount (net of Taxes (other than any recoverable VAT) or other out-of-pocket
costs payable by SBT or any of its Subsidiaries in respect thereof) to the
Paying Agent (for the benefit of the SBT Sellers) which amount (the "
_Collected Amount Purchase Price_ ") shall be distributed by the Paying Agent
to the SBT Sellers on a pro rata basis based on their respective Cash
Transaction Percentage among the SBT Sellers, and such Collected Amount
Purchase Price shall be regarded as part of the SBT Cash Consideration for
all purposes of this Agreement (including for Tax purposes).

in the Trust Account for the benefit of DEAC's public stockholders until the
Closing. For and in consideration of DEAC entering into this Agreement, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each of DK, SBT and
the SBT Sellers, on behalf of itself and any of its managers, directors,
officers, affiliates, members, stockholders and trustees, hereby irrevocably
waives any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they have or may have
in the future in or to any monies in the Trust Account, and agrees not to
seek recourse against the Trust Account or any funds distributed therefrom as
a result of, or arising out of, any claims against DEAC arising under this
Agreement (it being clarified that such waiver shall not apply following the
Closing to the Trust Account funds that are released from the Trust Account
to DEAC or New DK pursuant to Section 8.6).

  



  

Section 9.14 _Certain Third Party Balances_. The SBT Sellers and SBT
shall take all actions necessary (if any) to procure that all remaining
balances of SBT of any of its Subsidiaries owed to or by a party set forth on
Section 9.14 of the SBT Disclosure Letter have been repaid in full or settled
without penalty and that all contracts, transactions, arrangements or
liabilities with such party have been terminated, in each case no later than
the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall New DK or DK
or any of their Affiliates assume or incur any liability or obligation with
respect to such party's transactions or arrangements in connection with or as
a result of the Transactions.

  



  

Section 9.15 _Certain DEAC Actions_.

  



  

(a) _Cancellation of DEAC Founder Shares_. DEAC shall take all
actions necessary to cause the cancellation of (i) 270,000 of the DEAC
Shares held by the DEAC Founders (provided, that if DEAC and DK shall
mutually agree in writing, 120,000 of such DEAC Shares shall not be cancelled
and shall be used in connection with the Equity Offering) and (ii) the number
of DEAC Shares held by the DEAC Founders set forth in clause (ii) of _Section
9.15_ below, in each case pro rata to each Founder's ownership percentage of
the aggregate number of DEAC Shares held by the DEAC Founders, effective as of
immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b) _DEAC Warrants_. At the Closing, (i) the DEAC Founders shall
transfer 1,141,801 of the DEAC Warrants held by them, to the DK Stockholders,
pro rata in respect of the number of shares of New DK Class A Common Stock
(received as DK Merger Consideration) held by them as of immediately
following the Closing; and (ii) the value of 358,199 DEAC Warrants (agreed as
between the Parties to be US$ 2.00 per warrant, or US$ 716,398.00 in the
aggregate) shall be added to the valuation based on which the SBT Share
Exchange Ratio is calculated (the " _SBT Warrants Value_ "). To the extent
that as of immediately following the Closing, the DEAC Founders hold more
than 1,858,199 DEAC Warrants, any such DEAC Warrants in excess of such number
shall be forfeited and cancelled.

  



  

(c) _PIPE Conversion_. DEAC hereby agrees to execute and deliver a
joinder to each Subordinated Convertible Promissory Note, dated as of
December 16, 2019 or December 17, 2019 (collectively, the " _Promissory Notes_
"), executed and delivered by DK to the holders thereof, which joinder shall
obligate DEAC to issue DEAC Shares to the holder(s) of each Promissory
Note in accordance with the terms thereof as of immediately prior to the
Closing, contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. Immediately prior to
the Closing, DK shall be deemed to have issued a number of DK Shares to
satisfy the payment of all unpaid and outstanding interest associated with
such Promissory Notes, and such DK Shares shall be converted at the DK Merger
Effective Time as set forth in _Section 2.1(c)_. Proceeds generated from the
Promissory Notes shall not be included in determining whether the
condition set forth in _Section 11.1(i)_ has been satisifed unless expressly
agreed to in writing by DK.

  



  

(d) _DEAC Share Redemption_. At the Closing, DEAC shall use its best
efforts to cause the Trustee to pay as and when due all amounts payable to
stockholders of DEAC holding shares of the Class A Common Stock sold in DEAC's
initial public offering who shall have validly elected to redeem their shares
of Class A Common Stock (and who have not rescinded such election) pursuant
to DEAC's Organizational Documents and shall use its best efforts to cause
the Trustee to pay, as and when due, the Deferred Discount (as defined in the
Trust Agreement) pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement

Section 9.16 _DK Stockholder Consent_.

  



  

(a) DK shall obtain promptly after the execution of this Agreement,
and in any event no later than the end of the day following the date of this
Agreement, the written consent of the DK Stockholders holding at least the
minimum number of DK Shares required to approve the Transactions pursuant to
the DGCL and DK's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, pursuant to which
such DK Stockholders shall approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Transactions (the " _DK Stockholder Consent_ "). The DK Stockholder Consent
shall be irrevocable with respect to all DK Shares owned beneficially or of
record by the consenting DK Stockholders or as to which they have, directly
or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the voting thereof.

  



  

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the date on which DK obtains
the DK Stockholder Consent, the Company shall prepare and mail a notice (the
" _DK Stockholder Notice_ ") to every DK Stockholder that did not execute the
DK Stockholder Consent. The DK Stockholder Notice shall (i) be a statement to
the effect that the DK Board unanimously determined that the Transactions are
advisable in accordance with the DGCL and in the best interests of the DK
Stockholders and unanimously approved and adopted this Agreement and the
Transactions, (ii) provide the DK Stockholders to whom it is sent with notice
of the actions taken in the DK Stockholder Consent, including the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions in accordance with
the DGCL and the Organizational Documents of DK and (iii) notify such DK
Stockholders of their dissent and appraisal rights pursuant to the DGCL. The
DK Stockholder Notice will include therewith a copy of Section 262 of the
DGCL, and shall be sufficient in form and substance to start the twenty (20)
day period during which a DK Stockholder must demand appraisal of such DK
Stockholder's DK Common Stock as contemplated by the DGCL.

  



  

(c) In the event that the number of Dissenting Shares, if any, is
reasonably expected to exceed more than five percent (5%) of the
outstanding DK Shares as of immediately prior to the DK Merger Effective
Time, the Parties hereby agree to discuss in good faith whether
such Dissenting Shares would reasonably be expected to result in: (i) a
material dilution in the expected post-Closing ownership levels in New DK of
DEAC stockholders and the SBT Security Holders, or (ii) in the cash position
of New DK and its Subsidiaries. In the event the Parties mutually agree that
there would be such a material dilution or material reduction in such cash
position, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith an appropriate remedy to
the Losses suffered by the DEAC stockholders and the SBT Security Holders as
a result of such dilution or cash reduction.

  



  

Section 9.17 _Closing Conditions_. From the date hereof until the
Closing, each Party shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates and
Representatives to use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions as
are reasonably necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set
forth in _Article XI_. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party hereby
covenants and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to work together to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable and shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, execute
and deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and
assurances, and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to
give effect to such transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section 9.17_, shall not (a) require any Party to pay or commit to pay any
amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any Person to obtain any
consents, approvals or authorizations of any third parties that are required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other
than nominal filing, attorneys or application fees), (b) require any Party to
waive any of the conditions set forth in _Article XI_ or (c) limit any
Party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms and
conditions of _Section 12.1_.

  



  

Section 9.18 _Financing._  Prior to the earlier of the Closing and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, DK and SBT
shall cause the appropriate officers and employees thereof, to use reasonable
best efforts to cooperate in connection with the arrangement of the Equity
Offering as may be reasonably requested by DEAC, including by (i)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with investors at mutually
agreeable times and locations and upon reasonable advance notice, (ii)
reasonably assisting with the preparation of customary materials for actual
and potential participants in the Equity Offering, offering documents,
private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Equity Offering (which shall not include pro forma
financial information), (iii) providing financial statements and such other
financial information regarding DK and/or SBT as applicable, that is readily
available or within its possession and as is reasonably requested
in connection with the Equity Offering, (iv) taking or appointing a
representative of DEAC to take all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by DEAC to permit the
consummation of the Equity Offering and the issuance of shares of New DK
Class A Common Stock immediately following the Closing, (v) reasonably
assisting DEAC to satisfy the conditions set forth in any document executed
in connection with the Equity Offer and (vi) otherwise reasonably cooperating
in DEAC's efforts to consummate the Equity Offering. For the avoidance
of doubt, DEAC shall not consummate an Equity Offering for gross proceeds in
excess of US$ 304,713,520 (including the Subscription Agreements existing as
of the date of this Agreement) or on terms materially different than those
contained in such Subscription Agreements without the prior written consent
of DK and the SBT Sellers' Representative, and any such excess proceeds shall
be raised on substantially the same terms as those applicable to the Equity
Offering as of the date of this Agreement.

under _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_, the Indemnified Party must promptly,
but (i) with respect to SBT Non-Fundamental Representations, SBT Sellers Non-
Fundamental Representations and DK Non-Fundamental Representations, as
applicable, in no event later than the date that is two (2) years following
the Closing Date and (ii) with respect to SBT Fundamental Representations,
SBT Sellers Fundamental Representations and DK Fundamental Representations, in
no event later than the date of expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, provide written notice to the SBT Sellers' Representative (for
claims made by New DK Indemnified Parties) or to New DK (for claims made by
SBT Sellers Indemnified Parties) (the recipient of such notice, the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), which notice shall set forth a description in
reasonable detail of the occurrence(s) specified in _Section 10.2_ or
_Section 10.3_ which the Indemnified Party alleges to have occurred, a
description of the facts and circumstances giving rise to such occurrences,
the estimated amount of Losses imposed, incurred, suffered or asserted in
connection therewith or arising therefrom (to the extent then ascertainable),
and a description of any other remedy sought in connection therewith (subject
to the limitations in this Agreement), any relevant time constraints relating
thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining
thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ "). The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with
and provide to the Indemnifying Party such information under the Indemnified
Party's control as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request for the
purposes of determining the validity of the allegations made in the Claim
Notice and shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably and promptly informed
of factual and procedural developments (including additional information
which may come under the Indemnified Party's control) in connection therewith.
The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent
with applicable Law) to third parties and to cause all communications among
employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third Party Claim
(as defined below) to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client
or work product privileges.

  



  

(b) In the event the Claim Notice results from any Action asserted or
threatened against, the Indemnified Party by a third party (other than with
respect to Taxes, which in the event of Sellers Taxes or claims relating to
Taxes against the applicable SBT Security Holders, shall be controlled in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 13.5_) (a " _Third Party Claim_
"):

  



  

(i) The Indemnified Party shall provide the Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party not later than the tenth Business Day following
the Indemnified Party's receipt of the Third Party Claim, and in any event
not later than the tenth Business Day preceding the date by which an
appearance is required to be made before a court, arbitrator or other tribunal
or an answer or similar pleading is required to be filed in a litigation or
other proceeding; _provided_ that the failure to timely provide a Claim
Notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that such failure has a material prejudicial effect on
the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect
to such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(ii) During the period ending on the earlier of the 30th calendar day
following the Indemnifying Party's receipt of the Claim Notice and the fifth
calendar day preceding the date on which an appearance is required to be made
before a court, arbitrator or other tribunal or an answer or similar pleading
is required to be filed in a litigation or other proceeding, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to notify the Indemnified Party of his or its
election to assume and control the defense of the Third Party Claim, unless
(i) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable or non-
monetary relief against the Indemnified Party (other than injunctive,
equitable or non-monetary relief that is incidental to monetary damages as the
primary relief sought), (ii) the Third Party Claim arises in connection with
any criminal matter, (iii) the Losses sought in connection with such Third
Party Claim(s) are reasonably likely to exceed the Cap, or (iv) there is a
reasonable probability that the Third Party Claim may adversely affect the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary
damages.

A. In the event that the Indemnifying Party duly and timely makes
such election, such election shall constitute the Indemnifying
Party's conclusive acknowledgment that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
be indemnified, defended, held harmless and reimbursed in accordance with
this _Article X_ (subject to the limitations herein) for, from and against
the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall defend the Indemnified
Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power (as between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and their respective Affiliates)
to direct and control such defense and the settlement,
arbitration, litigation and appellate strategy relating to the Third Party
Claim. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled but not obligated to
participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing
for such purpose on its account; _provided that_ , if in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, there are defenses available to
the Indemnified Party that are different from or in addition to those
available to the Indemnifying Party, then the reasonable fees and expenses of
one external law firm to the Indemnified Party shall be paid in accordance
with _Section 10.4(b)(iv)A_; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that, if (i) the
Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party are both named parties to the
proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential conflicts between them or (ii) the Indemnified Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim after the Indemnifying Party has
failed to pursue a Third Party Claim it has assumed in a reasonably diligent
manner, as provided in the first sentence of this _Section 10.4(b)(ii)A_,
the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses of one additional counsel (in addition to, but only to the
extent necessary, one local counsel) which shall represent all Indemnified
Party arising out of the same or similar set of circumstances in connection
with such defense. If the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any
such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle such claims;
_provided_ that, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle, compromise or offer to settle,
compromise or cease to defend such Third Party Claim if such settlement,
compromise or cessation would result in (i) any monetary liability of the
Indemnified Party that will not be promptly paid or reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party; (ii) the imposition of a consent order, injunction or
decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates; (iii) a finding or admission of a violation
of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates; (iv) a finding or admission that would have an adverse
effect on other claims made or threatened against the Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates which are not indemnifiable hereunder; or (v) any non-
monetary condition or obligation being imposed on any Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates.

  



  

B. If the Indemnifying Party (i) does not duly and timely make such
election, or (ii) after timely making such election, fails to take reasonable
steps to defend diligently the Third Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days
after its receipt of written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect
that the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled but not obligated (subject to _Section 10.7_ ( _Minimizing and
Mitigating Losses)_ ) to notify the Indemnifying Party of its election to
assume and control such defense from the Indemnifying Party, whereupon the
Indemnified Party and not the Indemnifying Party shall have the powers
described in the first sentence of _Section 10.4(b)(ii)A_; _provided_ that
the Indemnified Party's right to be indemnified, defended, held harmless and
reimbursed in respect of the Third Party Claim shall not otherwise be
affected by such election. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability with respect to a
Third Party Claim settled without its prior written consent (which shall not
unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(iii) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate
in order to ensure the proper and adequate investigation and defense of all
Third Party Claims, including by providing reasonable access to each other's
relevant business records, documents and employees, for purposes of
investigation, document production, testimony and otherwise. The Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall keep each other fully and promptly
informed with respect to the status of all Third Party Claims and shall
deliver to each other copies of all material written notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the other that relate to any Third Party
Claims. The Person controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim shall in
good faith allow the Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, as the case may
be, to make comments to the materials filed or submitted in such defense, and
shall consider such comments in good faith.

  



  

(iv) All reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal fees, costs and
expenses actually incurred or suffered by the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party in connection with investigating and defending, and
cooperating in the investigation and defense of, the Third Party Claim ("
_Third Party Claim Expenses_ ") shall be paid as follows:

  



  

A. Any Third Party Claim Expenses actually incurred or suffered by
the Indemnified Party (1) prior to or in the absence of the due and timely
making of the election described in _Section 10.4(b)(ii)A_, (2) under the
circumstances described in the proviso to the second sentence of such
Section, (3) under the circumstances described in _Section 10.4(b)(ii)B_ or
(4) in compliance with _Section 10.4(b)(iii)_ shall constitute Losses for
which the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be reimbursed if the
Indemnified Party is determined pursuant to a Final Determination to be
entitled to be indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed pursuant to this
_Article X_ in respect of the Third Party Claim.

  



  

B. Third Party Claim Expenses not addressed by _Section
10.4(b)(iv)A_ shall be paid by the Person by which they were incurred.

  



  

Section 10.5 _Loss and Recoveries_.

  



  

(a) _No Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, except to the extent awarded by a court
to a third party pursuant to a Third Party Claim, (i) no Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to be indemnified, defended, held harmless or reimbursed
pursuant to this _Article X_ in respect of, and Losses shall not include, any
punitive, special or exemplary damages, loss of profit or loss of
opportunity, loss of reputation, consequential losses or any other indirect
damages that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the date of this
Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Insurance_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds
actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under
any insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or
payment by or against any other Person, in each case relating to the matters
described in the Claim Notice shall be deducted. The Indemnified Party shall,
use reasonable best efforts (including through litigation) to recover any
such insurance or other proceeds from third parties to the same extent such
Indemnified Party would recover such proceeds if such Losses were not subject
to indemnification hereunder). In the event that, after having complied with
the preceding sentence, an Indemnified Party still has any rights against a
third party with respect to any occurrence, claim or Loss that results in a
payment by an Indemnifying Party under this _Article X_, such Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to such rights to the extent of such payment;
_provided_ , that until the Indemnified Party recovers full payment of the
Loss associated with such payment, any and all claims of the Indemnifying
Party against any such third party on account of said indemnity payment are
hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment to the
Indemnified Party's rights against such third party. Each Indemnified Party
and Indemnifying Party shall duly execute upon request all instruments
reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the subrogation and
subordination rights detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate in the
prosecution of such claims.

  



  

(c) _Purchase Price Adjustment and Financial Statements_. No New DK
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be indemnified, defended,
held harmless or reimbursed for, from or against any Losses (and such Losses
shall not be counted against the Basket Amount or the Cap) to the extent such
Losses are included in the calculation of the Estimated SBT Working Capital,
Actual SBT Working Capital, Estimated SBT Net Debt or Actual SBT Net Debt
pursuant to _Section 3.5_ or included in and are reasonably apparent from the
SBT Audited Financial Statements or the SBT Unaudited Financial Statements).

  



  

   

 | 88| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Reimbursement_. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from
a third party in respect of a Loss after all or a portion of such Loss has
been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article X_, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess
(if any) of (i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such
Loss, plus the amount received from the third party in respect thereof,
_less_ (ii) the full amount of the Loss indemnifiable pursuant to this
Agreement.

  



  

(e) _No Double Recovery_. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover more than once in respect of the same Loss (notwithstanding that such
Loss may result from more than one of the occurrences specified in _Section
10.2_ or _10.3_ , as the case may be).

  



  

(f) _No Circular Recovery_. The SBT Sellers (including any officer
or director of any SBT Seller that is an entity) shall not have any right of
contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from SBT or DK with
respect to any Loss claimed by a New DK Indemnified Party. The SBT Sellers
and the SBT Sellers' Representative shall not make any claim for monetary
damages or indemnification against either DK or SBT or any of their
respective Subsidiaries with respect to any claim properly brought by a New DK
Indemnified Party under this _Article X_ or otherwise relating to this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, other than a claim pursuant to _Section 10.3_. New DK, DK and SBT
and any of their Subsidiaries shall not have a claim against the SBT Sellers
in case of any claims against any of them in connection with the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, other than a claim
pursuant to _Section 10.2_.

  



  

(g) _Effect of Waiver of Condition_. No Party's right to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be adversely affected by
its waiver of a condition to the Closing set forth in _Article XI_ unless
such Party makes clear by the terms of its waiver that it is foreclosing its
right to indemnification with respect to all Losses in connection with or
arising out of the facts and circumstances that are the subject of the
waiver.

  



  

(h) _Opportunity to Remedy Breaches_. If a breach or
misrepresentation of any representation or a breach of any covenant or
undertaking set out in this Agreement is capable of remedy, the Indemnified
Party shall only be entitled to be indemnified (subject to all other
limitations on liability set out in this Agreement), if the Indemnified Party
gives the Indemnifying Party a written notice of such breach or
misrepresentation and such breach or misrepresentation is not fully remedied
within thirty (30) days after the date on which such notice is served on the
Indemnifying Party, if capable of being remedied.

  



  

(i) _Several Liability_. All liabilities of the SBT Security Holders
pursuant to this Agreement are several and not joint and several.

  



  

(j) _Post Completion Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to be indemnified for
any Losses arising out of the breach of any of the representations and
warranties in Section 4.13 relating to any Tax period or part of a Tax period
starting on or after the Closing, other than (i) in respect of the
representations and warranties in Sections 4.13(g), (i) and (n) (for which a
claim for indemnity may be made until one (1) year following the
Closing Date) and (ii) in respect of the representations and warranties in
Sections 4.13(t) and (o) (for which a claim for indemnity may be made until
three (3) years following the Closing Date).

  



  

(k) _No Tax Liability for Post-Closing Arrangements_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set out in this Agreement, the SBT
Security Holders shall not be liable pursuant to this Agreement for any Tax,
including any Seller Taxes or any Taxes in respect of the Pre-Closing Tax
Period (but excluding, subject to any other limitations in this Agreement, any
Tax: (i) on ordinary course income, (ii) that results from any transfer
pricing Law, (iii) that is or results from the imposition of any withholding
Tax, (iv) that is a VAT, (v) that results from reclassification of expenses,
employees or an item of income from one type to another type of income or
(vi) that is the result of any item of deduction being disallowed for purposes
of calculating any Tax liability) if the liability in respect of such Tax has
been triggered, initiated or arisen as a result of or in connection with any
transaction (or any other form of realization for Tax purposes) or
arrangement taking place following the Closing, including any re-
domiciliation, restructuring, share or asset sale, transfer or assignment
(including the transfer of intellectual property or other rights) or employee
transfer or assignment, initiated following the Closing by any of New DK, DK,
SBT, or any of their respective Subsidiaries at the relevant time. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 10.5(k) shall not create or increase any
indemnification obligation of the SBT Security Holders.

pursuant to _Section 10.3_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the applicable Indemnified
Party within ten (10) Business Days after the determination thereof.

  



  

(c) In the event that any Loss is incurred or suffered by an
Indemnified Party in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, and the
Indemnified Party elects for such claim to indemnification to be paid in U.S.
Dollars, such foreign currency Loss shall be converted into U.S. Dollars
based on the European Union central bank rate in such other country for the
conversion of such currency into U.S. Dollars in effect as of the date of
Final Determination of the applicable claim.

  



  

(d) All payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified
Party in respect of any claim pursuant to _Section 10.2_ or  _Section 10.3_
shall be treated as adjustments to the consideration paid pursuant to the
Transactions for Tax purposes to the extent permitted under applicable Law.

  



  

Section 10.7 _Minimizing and Mitigating Losses_. Each Indemnified
Party shall take all reasonable actions to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss
(including by taking any reasonable actions requested by the Indemnifying
Party), and if the Indemnified Party fails to do so, the Indemnified Party
shall not be entitled to be indemnified, defended, held harmless or reimbursed
for any portion of such Loss that reasonably could have been avoided had the
Indemnified Party so complied.

Delaware Law in making any representation or warranty contained in _Article
IV_, _Article V_, _VI_ or _Article VII_, (iii) claims for specific
enforcement or injunction pursuant to _Section 14.8_ and (iv) claims pursuant
to the terms of any Ancillary Agreement. Following the Closing, the claims
and remedies specified in _clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_ of the previous
sentence shall constitute the Parties' sole and exclusive rights and remedies
available to the Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses or other claims
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transactions and any
document or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith, and
shall supersede all other rights and remedies available at law or in
equity (including any right of rescission). Accordingly, effective as of the
Closing, each Party hereby irrevocably waives and discharges, and releases
each other Party, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, from,
all other claims, causes of action and Actions relating thereto.

(b) In addition to _Section 10.8(a)_, this Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any Action, right or remedy that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the
Transactions, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,

this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, the Transactions or any document or
instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith, in each case whether
based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Law or otherwise and whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of a Party or another person or otherwise. Each Party hereby waives and
discharges any such claim, cause of action, right, remedy and Action, and
releases (and agrees to execute and deliver any instrument necessary to
effectuate the release of) each Nonparty therefrom. The provisions of this
_Section 10.8(b)_ are for the benefit of and shall be enforceable by each
Nonparty, which is an intended third-party beneficiary of this _Section
10.8(b)_ and _Section 9.20_ ( _Further Assurances_ ) in connection herewith.

and subject to _Section 9.16(c)_.

Section 12.2 _Termination Fees_.

  



  

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 12.1_ (other than if circumstances giving rise to a termination
right pursuant to _Section 12.1(c)_ or _Section 12.1(e)_ are in existence
where, in each case, the primary reason for the effectiveness of such
termination right was the breach or failure to perform by SBT or the
SBT Sellers of any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements and the failure to cure them (if capable of being cured) within
thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of such breach or failure to
perform), then within two (2) Business Days of such termination, DK shall pay
to SBT the SBT Termination Fee by wire transfer in immediately available funds
to an account specified in writing by SBT.

  



  

(b) DK and SBT hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that: (i)
the SBT Termination Fee is payable in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 12.2_ and regardless of any fault or breach by DK or any other
Person; (ii) upon any valid termination of this Agreement where the SBT
Termination Fee becomes due and payable, the payment of the SBT Termination
Fee pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_ shall be in full and complete satisfaction
of any and all monetary damages of SBT and its Affiliates, and their
respective directors, officers and other Representatives that may be claimed
by SBT and its Affiliates against DK, its Subsidiaries and any of its
or their respective directors, officers and other Representatives, arising
out of or related to this Agreement or the Transactions, including as a
result of any breach of this Agreement by DK, the termination of this
Agreement by DK, the failure to consummate the Transactions by DK, and any
claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of such breach, termination
or failure; (iii) in no event shall SBT or its Affiliates, or any of their
respective directors, officers or other Representatives, be entitled to
seek or obtain any recovery or judgment in excess of the SBT Termination Fee
against DK, its Subsidiaries and any of its or their respective directors,
officers and other Representatives; (iv) the payment required pursuant to this
_Section 12.2_ is not a penalty, but constitutes liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate SBT in the circumstances in which
such payment is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and
(v) the amount of the SBT Termination Fee is fair, after taking into account
the value of the Transactions and all the costs and expenses already incurred
by the parties before entering into this Agreement; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 12.2(b)_, payment
by DK of the SBT Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_ shall not
relieve DK from any liability or damage resulting from fraud or any willful
and material breach of this Agreement (in which case damages may be claimed
by SBT against DK beyond the SBT Termination Fee); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that such SBT Termination Fee shall be credited towards any future award of
damages awarded to SBT pursuant to any claim against DK based on fraud or any
willful and material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by any Party as provided in _Section 12.1_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of any Party, other than the
provisions of the penultimate sentence of _Section 9.3_, _Section 9.6_,
_Section 12.2_, this _Section 12.3 _and _Article XIV_, which provisions
shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall relieve any party from any liability for fraud or any willful and
material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

Article XIII 
 TAX MATTERS

  



  

Section 13.1 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration, recording, value added and other such Taxes, fees
and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred on the
Transactions (including any real property transfer Tax and any other
similar Tax) shall be borne and paid equally by New DK, on the one hand, and
the SBT Sellers, on the other hand (provided, that the total amount paid out-
of-pocket by the SBT Sellers in respect of such Taxes shall be 50% of such
Taxes). The Party required under applicable Law to file any Tax Return or
other document with respect to such Taxes or fees shall, at its own expense,
timely file any such Tax Return or other document (and the other Parties
shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary).

  



  

   

 | 96| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 13.2 _Israeli Tax Rulings_. SBT and certain SBT Sellers
intend to prepare and file with the ITA an application for a ruling permitting
any such SBT Seller who elects to become a party to such a Tax ruling (each,
an " _Electing Holder_ "), to defer any applicable Israeli Tax, if applied,
with respect to such SBT Consideration Shares (and if deemed necessary by such
Electing Holder, any SBT Earnout Shares) that such Electing Holder will
receive pursuant to this Agreement until the sale, transfer or other
conveyance for cash of such share portion of the consideration by such
Electing Holder or such other date set forth in Section 104H of the ITO (the
" _104H Tax Ruling_ "). DEAC, DK and New DK, as applicable shall reasonably
cooperate with SBT, the Electing Holders and their Israeli counsel with
respect to the preparation and filing of such application and in the
preparation of any written submissions that may be necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain the 104H Tax Ruling or the 104H Interim Ruling, provided
that any costs associated with the application for the 104H Tax Ruling shall
be paid by SBT. Each written submission or application for the 104H Tax
Ruling or the Interim 104H Ruling shall be in a form approved in good faith by
DK prior to submission (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Upon the obtaining of the 104H Tax Ruling or the
104H Interim Ruling, as applicable, DEAC, New DK, SBT and any trustee
appointed pursuant to the 104H Tax Ruling shall furnish to the ITA a
customary approval letter, prepared by SBT and approved in good faith by each
Person that will furnish such letter, of the terms of such ruling.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.6, if the 104H Tax Ruling or the
104H Interim Ruling shall be received at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the applicable withholding date, then the provisions of the 104H
Tax Ruling or the 104H Interim Ruling shall apply with respect to each
Electing Holder and, solely for purposes of Israeli Taxes, all applicable
withholding and reporting procedures with respect to the consideration payable
hereunder shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the 104H Tax
Ruling or 104H Interim Ruling, as applicable, and Section 104H of the ITO.

  



  

Section 13.3 _Straddle Period Allocation_.

  



  

In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes that are not
determined on a periodic basis that are in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period
will be determined based on a closing of the books as of the end of the
Closing Date (and for such purpose, and for determining liabilities for Taxes
under this Agreement, the Tax period of any entity will be deemed to terminate
at such time), provided, however, that any Taxes arising as a result of any
non-ordinary course actions taken (or caused to be taken) by DK, DEAC or new
DK on the Closing Date after the Closing shall not be allocated to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period. The amount of any Taxes that are determined on a
periodic basis for a Straddle Period that are in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax
Period will be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such Straddle Period.

  



  

Section 13.4 _Tax Returns_. Following the Closing, New DK shall cause
to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by SBT and its
Subsidiaries and shall cause to be delivered to the SBT Sellers'
Representative for review and comment a draft of any such Tax Returns that
are with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (a "Pre-
Closing Tax Return") at least forty five (45) days prior to the applicable
filing deadline (or, if the deadline is within 30 days after the
Closing Date, as early as is commercially reasonable prior to the filing
deadline), together with a calculation of the Taxes allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period pursuant to Section 13.3. New DK shall in good faith
implement any reasonable comments made by the SBT Sellers' Representative,
provided such comments are made in writing as soon as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within twenty (20) days of the Pre-Closing Tax Return and
calculation being provided to the SBT Sellers' Representative), provided
further that such comments either (i) do not increase the amount of any Seller
Taxes and do not have an adverse impact with respect to Taxes of New DK, SBT
or their Subsidiaries or (ii) are required under applicable Law. Except as
required under applicable Law, no Pre-Closing Tax Return shall filed, refiled
or amended without the written consent of the SBT Sellers' Representative
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), it
being understood that notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, no SBT Security Holder shall be liable for indemnification with
respect any Taxes arising as a result of the filing, re-filing or amending a
Pre-Closing Tax Return that is not prepared and filed in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 13.4.

  



  

   

 | 97| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 13.5 _Tax Contests_. New DK shall promptly notify the SBT
Sellers' Representative following receipt of any notice of audit or
other proceeding relating to any Tax matter for which the applicable SBT
Security Holders may be required to indemnify any Person pursuant to this
Agreement. The SBT Sellers' Representative shall have the right to control any
such Tax audit or other proceeding for which the SBT Sellers may be required
to indemnify any Person pursuant to this Agreement (any such audit, a
"Seller Controlled Audit"). With respect to any Seller Controlled Audit, New
DK shall have the right to participate (at its own expense) in such audit or
other proceeding, and the SBT Sellers' Representative shall not settle or
compromise such Tax audit or proceeding without the prior written consent of
New DK, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

Section 13.6 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, but subject to Section 13.2, New DK, DK, the Paying Agent,
the Escrow Agent, the 102 Trustee and any other Person acting on their behalf
(each, a "Payor") shall be entitled to withhold from any amount of
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any SBT Seller or any other
(including any portion of the Escrow Amount and any other payment therefrom)
such amounts as New DK or DK reasonably determines are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of any such payment under
any applicable Law, the 104H Interim Ruling or the 104H Tax Ruling, if
obtained, unless New DK or DK is provided with an exemption from such
withholding in respect of each such payment, or, with respect to Israeli
withholding tax, a withholding certificate from the ITA which determines the
withholding tax rate or tax amount, to the full satisfaction of New DK and DK
(and for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to Israeli Taxes, a Valid Tax
Certificate is required for exemption with respect to Israeli Tax Residents)
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date of such payment). Any
amount so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority shall be
deemed to have been paid over to the applicable SBT Seller or other Persons
for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
and anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and subject to the 104H
Interim Ruling and the 104H Tax Ruling, if the Paying Agent provides a Payor
prior to the Closing Date an undertaking as required under Section 6.2.4.3(c)
of the Income Tax Circular 19/2018 (Transaction for Sale of Rights in a
Corporation that includes Consideration that will be transferred to the Seller
at Future Dates) (the "Paying Agent Undertaking") with respect to Israeli
Taxes, the SBT Cash Consideration, as may be adjusted, payable to Israeli Tax
Residents shall be paid to and retained by the Paying Agent for the benefit of
each such Israeli payment recipient for a period of one-hundred eighty (180)
days from the Closing Date or any other payment date, as applicable (or, with
respect to the Escrow Amount and the Adjustment and Expense Fund, ninety (90)
days from the date on which such amounts or any remaining balance thereof is
released), or an earlier date required in writing by a payment recipient or
the ITA (the "Withholding Drop Date") (during which time unless requested
otherwise by the ITA, no payments shall be made by the Paying Agent to
any payment recipient and no amounts for Israeli Taxes shall be withheld from
the payments deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, except as provided below
and during which time each payment recipient may obtain a Valid Tax
Certificate). If a payment recipient delivers, no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the applicable Withholding Drop Date a Valid Tax
Certificate to the Paying Agent, then the deduction and withholding of any
Israeli Taxes shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such
Valid Tax Certificate. If any payment recipient (i) does not provide the
Paying Agent with a Valid Tax Certificate by no later than five (5) Business
Days before the applicable Withholding Drop Date, or (ii) submits a written
request to the Paying Agent to release his portion of the SBT Cash
Consideration, as may be adjusted, the Escrow Amount or the Adjustment and
Expense Fund, prior to the applicable Withholding Drop Date and fails to
submit a Valid Tax Certificate no later than five (5) Business Days before
such time, then the amount to be withheld from such payment recipient's
portion of the SBT Cash Consideration, as may be adjusted, the Escrow Amount
or the Adjustment and Expense Fund, shall be calculated according to the
withholding rate under applicable Israeli Law, which amount shall be
calculated in New Israel Shekels based on the euro-NIS exchange rate known on
the date the payment is actually made to such recipient. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) no withholding on account of Israeli Taxes shall apply with
respect to a SBT Security Holder who is not an Israeli Tax Resident (and with
respect to an SBT Seller who is an Israeli Tax Resident, any withholding, if
any, shall be only in accordance with Sections 13.2 and 13.6); and (ii) New
DK shall have no right of recourse, set off, claim or otherwise against any
amount paid to the Paying Agent (for the benefit of any SBT Security Holder)
pursuant to this Agreement, which amount shall be released to the applicable
SBT Security Holder or 102 Trustee as applicable, by the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement. A
"Valid Tax Certificate" means a valid and applicable certificate or ruling
issued by the ITA that is sufficient to reasonably enable the Paying Agent to
conclude that no withholding (or reduced withholding) of Israeli Tax is
required with respect to a payment recipient. An "Israeli Tax Resident" shall
mean a taxpayer that did not properly execute the declaration set forth in
Exhibit G at least five (5) Business Days prior to the payment date.

Section 13.7 _Payor_. Subject to the the 104H Interim Ruling and the
104H Tax Ruling, with respect to any consideration paid hereunder to an SBT
Seller, the Payor shall first deduct or withhold any amounts, if required,
pursuant to Section 3.16 from the cash portion of such SBT Seller's
consideration to the extent sufficient to cover such amounts and then reduce
the amount of the share consideration issuable to such Person on account of
such deduction or withholding as provided in Section 13.6. Each Person hereby
waives, releases and absolutely and forever discharges the Payor or anyone
acting on its behalf from and against any and all claims for any Losses in
connection with the forfeiture or sale of any portion of SBT Consideration
Shares otherwise deliverable to such SBT Seller under this Agreement, to the
extent such forfeiture or sale is required pursuant to this Section 13.7. To
the extent that a Payor is unable, for whatever reason, to sell the SBT
Consideration Shares required to finance applicable deduction or withholding
requirements, then the Paying Agent shall be entitled to hold all of the SBT
Consideration Shares deliverable to the applicable SBT Seller until the
earlier of: (a) the receipt of a Valid Tax Certificate from the SBT Seller
fully exempting the Payor from tax withholding; or (b) such time when the
Payor is able to sell the portion of such SBT Consideration Shares otherwise
deliverable to such SBT Seller that is required to enable the Payor to comply
with such applicable deduction or withholding requirements. Any reasonable
costs or expenses incurred by the relevant Payor in connection with such sale
shall be borne by, and deducted from the payment to, the applicable SBT
Seller.

  



  

Section 13.8 _Tax Refunds_. Any refund of Taxes of SBT or any of its
pre-Closing Subsidiaries that arose in a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
any application of such a refund as a payment of, or a credit against, Taxes
in a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date) (a "Pre-Closing Tax
Refund"), will be credited to the SBT Sellers and holders of SBT Cashed-Out
Options, each based on its or his Cash Transaction Percentage. New DK will
promptly pay, or cause to be paid, the amount of any such Pre-Closing
Tax Refund, including the amount of interest received thereon, to the Paying
Agent (for the benefit of the SBT Sellers and holders of SBT Cashed-Out
Options) upon receipt (or use) of such Pre-Closing Tax Refund by any of New DK
or its Subsidiaries including, following the Closing, SBT, or any of its
Affiliates. No Pre-Closing Tax Refund shall be credited or paid under this
_Section 13.8 _to the extent that (i) such Pre-Closing Tax Refund was taken
into account in SBT Working Capital, in the SBT Audited Financial Statements
or the SBT Unaudited Financial Statements or (ii) any New DK Indemnified Party
was not indemnified for any Losses of the type described in _Section
10.2(a)_ or (b) as a result of the limitations on such
indemnification provided in this Agreement, provided that any Pre-Closing Tax
Refund amount in excess of such non indemnifiable Losses shall be refunded to
the SBT Sellers and holders of SBT Cashed-Out Options.

being lawfully spent, distributed, loaned or released by SBT within
15 Business Days from Closing, including but not limited to any restricted
deposits (such as bank required guarantees provided to Related Parties).

  



  

" _Unvested SBT Options_ " means any SBT Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and is unvested as of immediately prior to the Closing, excluding
for the avoidance of doubt any SBT Option (or portion thereof) that, as a
result of the Transactions contemplated herein will accelerate in full and no
longer be subject to any further vesting (while ignoring the requirement that
a Transaction (as defined in SBT Plan) is a vesting requirement).

or similar tax.

  



  

" _Vested SBT Option_ " means any SBT Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and is vested as of immediately prior to the Closing, after
taking into account any SBT Option (or portion thereof) that, as a result of
the transaction contemplated herein will accelerate in full and no longer be
subject to any further vesting. For the avoidance of doubt, an SBT Option will
be deemed vested based on its time vesting schedule only (as may be
accelerated in accordance with the terms of any option agreement) and without
regards to a "Transaction" (as defined in the SBT Plan) required to take
effect as a condition to the ability to exercise such option.

aggregate amount (which may be positive or negative) as at the Effective

be excluded from Cash Balances), Excluded Receivables, and any other amounts
expressly required to be excluded in accordance with Section 3.5 of the SBT
Disclosure Schedule; minus (b) all current liabilities of SBT and its
Subsidiaries including trade payables, payroll payables and accruals, VAT
payable but excluding amounts included within Indebtedness of SBT, deferred
taxes and any other amounts expressly required to be excluded in accordance
with Section 3.5 of the SBT Disclosure Letter.

Indemnified Parties, who are intended third party beneficiaries of the
provisions of _Section 9.5_, are not intended to confer upon any

Section 14.6 _Governing Law_. Except to the extent the laws of the state
of Nevada are mandatorily applicable to the Transactions, this Agreement
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof.

  



  

Section 14.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any Party without the prior written consent
of the other Parties (but in relation to the SBT Sellers, the prior written
consent of the SBT Sellers' Representative on their behalf shall be
sufficient), and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent
shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 14.8 _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction_. The
Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that they would not have
any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement without proof of actual damages, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
Parties hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware (or in the event, but only in the event, that such
court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or
proceeding, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial
Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the action or proceeding is
vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware) (such courts, the
_" Chosen Courts"_)). In addition, each of the Parties irrevocably (a) submits
itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for the purpose of
any litigation directly or indirectly based upon, relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or any of the Transactions or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof or thereof, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
the Chosen Courts and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating
to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than the Chosen
Courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
litigation with respect to this Agreement, (x) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for any reason
other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 14.8_, (y)
any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in Chosen Courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (z) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the
suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced in or
by such courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to service
being made through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 14.2 _and
agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by personal
delivery to the respective addresses set forth in _Section 14.2_ shall be
effective service of process for any litigation in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions. Nothing in this _Section 14.8_ shall affect
the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted
by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 14.8_ shall not apply to
any procedures, resolutions or determination by the Reporting Accountants in
accordance with _Section 3.5_ with respect to the matters set out in 
_Section 3.5_, and the provisions of _Section 3.5_ and not this _Section
14.8_ shall govern all matters contemplated to be determined by the Reporting
Accountants.

Section 14.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY
HAS CONSIDERED AND UNDERSTANDS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 14.9_.

  



  

Section 14.10 _Severability_. Except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, if any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

Section 14.11 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law, and except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented only by a written instrument executed and delivered by all of
the Parties (except that the SBT Sellers' Representative written agreement to
such amendment, modification or supplement shall bind the SBT Sellers to such
amendment), whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Transactions; _provided_ that after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made for which applicable Law or the rules of any relevant
stock exchange requires further approval by a Party's shareholders without
such further approval.

  



  

Section 14.12 _Further Assurances_. The Parties agree to execute and
deliver to each other such other documents and to do such other acts and
things, all as the other Parties may reasonably request for the purpose of
carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the documents referred to in
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 14.13 _Extension; Waiver_.

  



  

(a) At any time prior to the Closing, each Party may (and the SBT
Sellers' Representative may, on behalf of the SBT Sellers): (i) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
Parties, (ii) to the extent permitted by Law, waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein by any other Party or in any
document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by any other
applicable party or (iii) subject to the provision to _Section 14.11_ and to
the extent permitted by Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any Party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party (and in case of any SBT Seller, signed
by the SBT Sellers' Representative on his or its behalf).

  



   

121

 



    



  

  

(b) The failure of any Party to this Agreement to exercise any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver by
such Party of such right.

series or of any other class or series, or on increases or decreases in the

any other class or series.

  



  

Section 3. _Common Stock_. The holders of shares of Common Stock shall have
such rights as are set forth in the NRS and, to the extent permitted
thereunder, such additional rights as are set forth below:

  



  

(a) _Voting_. Except as otherwise expressly provided by these
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the " _Amended and
Restated Articles_ ") or as provided by law, the holders of shares of Class A
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall (i) at all times vote together as

rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations or restrictions of either
such class of Common Stock as compared to those of the other class of Common

Common Stock shall not be cancelled pursuant to this clause (B) unless and
until the one-year anniversary of the date that both Trigger Conditions are
subsequently met (such date, the " _Next Founder Termination Anniversary Date_
");  _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event of a subsequent Reset Event,

or any part of any shares of any class of stock herein or hereafter
authorized to such persons ( _provided_ that shares of Class B Common Stock
may be issued only to, and registered in the name of, the Permitted Class B
Owners), and for such consideration, as the Board of Directors shall from
time to time, in its discretion, determine, whether or not greater
consideration could be received upon the issuance or sale of the same number
of shares of another class, and as otherwise permitted by law. Subject to the
requirements of applicable law, the Corporation shall have the power to
purchase all or any part of any shares of any class of stock herein or
hereafter authorized from such persons, and for such consideration, as the
Board of Directors shall from time to time, in its discretion, determine,
whether or not less consideration could be paid upon the purchase of the same
number of shares of another class, and as otherwise permitted by law.

  



  

Section 5. _Transfers of Class B Common Stock_.

  



  

(a) A holder of Class B Common Stock may not Transfer (as defined
below) shares of Class B Common Stock, other than (i) to a Permitted Class B
Owner or (ii) upon divorce, as required by settlement, order or decree, or as
required by a domestic relations settlement, order or decree (in each case, a
" _Permitted Transfer_ "); _provided_ that in each case, the Founder shall be
deemed to retain the sole voting power to vote such transferred Class B Common
Stock.

  



   

-7-

 



    



  

For purposes of this Section 5, " _Transfer_ " of a share of Class B Common
Stock shall mean, any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, hypothecation or
other transfer or disposition, whether direct or indirect, of such share or
any legal or beneficial interest in such share, whether or not for value and
whether voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law (including by merger,
consolidation or otherwise), including, without limitation, a transfer of a
share of Class B Common Stock to a broker or other nominee (regardless of
whether there is a corresponding change in beneficial ownership), or the
transfer of, or entering into a binding agreement with respect to, Voting
Control (as defined below) over such share by proxy or otherwise (other than
proxy(ies), voting instruction(s) or voting agreement(s) solicited on behalf
of the Board of Directors). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the pledge of
shares of Class B Common Stock by a stockholder that creates a mere security
interest in such shares pursuant to a bona fide loan or indebtedness
transaction for so long as such stockholder continues to exercise Voting
Control over such pledged shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
foreclosure on such shares or other similar action by the pledgee shall
constitute a "Transfer" unless such foreclosure or similar action
independently qualifies as a "Permitted Transfer" at such time shall not be
considered a " _Transfer_ " within the meaning of this Article IV.

  



  

A " _Transfer_ " shall also be deemed to have occurred with respect to a
share of Class B Common Stock beneficially held by the transferor, if there
occurs any act or circumstance that causes such transfer to not be a
Permitted Transfer.

  



  

For purposes of this Section 5, " _Voting Control_ " shall mean, with respect
to a share of Class B Common Stock, the power (whether exclusive or shared) to
vote or direct the voting of such share by proxy, voting agreement or
otherwise.

  



  

(b) Any purported transfer of shares of Class B Common Stock in
violation of this Section 5 shall be null and void. If, notwithstanding the
limitations set out in this Section 5, a person shall voluntarily or
involuntarily, purportedly become or attempt to become, the purported owner
(the " _Purported Owner_ ") of shares of Class B Common Stock in violation of
these limitations, then the Purported Owner shall not obtain any rights in
and to such shares of Class B Common Stock and the purported transfer shall
not be recognized by the Corporation's transfer agent.

  



  

(c) Upon a determination by the Board of Directors that a person
has attempted or is attempting to acquire shares of Class B Common Stock, or
has purportedly transferred or acquired shares of Class B Common Stock, in
each case in violation of the limitations set out in this Section 5, the
Board of Directors may take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to
give effect to such attempted or purported transfer or acquisition on the
books and records of the Corporation, including without limitation, to
institute proceedings to enjoin any such attempted or purported transfer or
acquisition, or reverse any entries or records reflecting such attempted or
purported transfer or acquisition.

  



  

(d) The Board of Directors shall have all powers necessary to
implement the limitations set out in this Section 5, including without
limitation, the power to prohibit transfer of any shares of Class B Common
Stock in violation thereof.

  



   

-8-

 



    



  

(e) All certificates or book-entries representing shares of Class B
Common Stock shall bear a legend substantially in the following form (or in
such other form as the Board of Directors may determine):

  



  

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS [CERTIFICATE][BOOK-ENTRY] ARE SUBJECT TO
THE RESTRICTIONS (INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER) SET FORTH IN THE AMENDED
AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION (A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE
SECRETARY OF THE CORPORATION AND SHALL BE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE TO ANY
STOCKHOLDER MAKING A REQUEST THEREFOR.

  



  

ARTICLE V

  

 _BOARD OF DIRECTORS_

  



  

Section 1. _Powers of the Board_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.

  



  

Section 2. _Number of Directors_. Subject to the rights, if any, of the
holders of any outstanding class or series of Preferred Stock with respect to
the election of directors, the number of directors of the Corporation shall
be fixed, and may be altered from time to time, exclusively by resolution of
the Board of Directors; _provided_ that the initial number of directors of
the Corporation shall be eleven (11); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that from and
after the time that a Founder beneficially owns less than a majority of the
voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote at an annual or special meeting duly noticed
and called in accordance with these Amended and Restated Articles (the "

ARTICLE XII

  

 _UNSUITABLE PERSONS_

  



  

Section 1. _Finding of Unsuitability_.

  



  

(a) The Equity Interests owned or controlled by an Unsuitable
Person or an Affiliate of an Unsuitable Person (as applicable) shall
be subject to mandatory sale and transfer on the terms and conditions set
forth herein on the Transfer Date to either the Corporation or one or more
Third Party Transferees and in such number and class(es)/series of Equity
Interests as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith (following
consultation with independent gaming regulatory counsel) pursuant to a
resolution adopted by the unanimous affirmative vote of all of the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors; _provided_ that any
such sale or transfer shall occur subject to the following and shall not
occur (and a Transfer Notice shall not be sent, and the Transfer Date shall
be extended accordingly) until the later to occur of: (i) delivery to such
Person of a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the unanimous affirmative
vote of all of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors at a
meeting thereof called and held for the purpose (after providing reasonable
notice to such Person and a reasonable opportunity for such Person,
together with the counsel of such Person, to be heard before the Board of
Directors at such meeting and to provide documents and written arguments to
the Board a reasonable length of time in advance of such meeting), finding
that the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (following
consultation with independent gaming regulatory counsel) that (A) such Person
is an Unsuitable Person, and (B) it is necessary for such Person to sell and
transfer such number and class(es)/series of Equity Interests in order
for the Corporation or any Affiliated Company to: (1) obtain, renew, maintain
or prevent the loss, rejection, rescission, suspension, revocation or non-
renewal of a material Gaming License; (2) comply in any material respect with
a material Gaming Law; (3) ensure that any material Gaming License held or
desired in good faith to be held by the Corporation or any Affiliated Company,
or the Corporation's or any Affiliated Company's application for, right to
the use of, entitlement to, or ability to obtain or retain, any material
Gaming License held or desired in good faith to be held by the Corporation or
any Affiliated Company, is not precluded, delayed, impeded, impaired,
threatened or jeopardized in any material respect; or (4) prevent the
imposition of any materially burdensome terms or conditions on any material
Gaming License held or desired in good faith to be held by the Corporation or
any Affiliated Company, and specifying the reasoning for such determinations
in reasonable detail, and (ii) conclusion of the arbitration process
described below (if applicable); _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event
that such Person reasonably believes that any of the above-described
determinations by the Board of Directors were not made in good faith and
such disagreement cannot be settled amicably by such Person and the
Corporation, such disagreement with respect to whether the Board of
Director's determination(s) were made in good faith shall be finally,
exclusively and conclusively settled by mandatory arbitration conducted
expeditiously in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_
") rules, by a single independent arbitrator (to be chosen by mutual
agreement of the Unsuitable Person and the Corporation, and if the parties
are unable to agree, to be chosen as provided in the AAA rules) in an
arbitration process that shall take place in Boston, Massachusetts, with each
party bearing its own legal fees and expenses, unless otherwise determined by
the arbitrator. For the avoidance of doubt, the only question before the
arbitrator shall be whether such determinations were made by the Board in
good faith. For the further avoidance of doubt, at the initial meeting
described above with respect to whether a Person is an Unsuitable Person, the
Board of Directors may defer making any such determination in order to conduct
further investigation into the matter, but in connection with any future
meeting of the Board of Directors regarding the matter, such Person shall be
provided with reasonable notice and a reasonable opportunity for such Person,
together with the counsel of such Person, to be heard before the Board
of Directors at such meeting and to provide documents and written arguments
to the Board a reasonable length of time in advance of such meeting.
Following (x) the Board of Directors determining in good faith (following
consultation with independent gaming regulatory counsel) and in accordance
with the foregoing (including such determination being made pursuant to a
resolution of the Board of Directors adopted by a unanimous affirmative vote
of all of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors), that such
Person is an Unsuitable Person and it is necessary for such Person to sell
and transfer a certain number and class(es)/series of Equity Interests for
any of the reasons set forth above, and (y) if applicable, the arbitrator
determining that such determinations were made in good faith by the Board of
Directors, the Corporation shall deliver a Transfer Notice to the Unsuitable
Person or its Affiliate(s) (as applicable) and shall purchase and/or cause
one or more Third Party Transferees to purchase such number and
class(es)/series of Equity Interests determined in good faith by the Board in
accordance with the foregoing and specified in the Transfer Notice on the
Transfer Date and for the Purchase Price set forth in the Transfer Notice
(which Purchase Price shall be determined in accordance with the definition
of Purchase Price in Article I); _provided_ that an Unsuitable Person or its
Affiliate(s) (as applicable) shall be permitted, during the forty five
(45)-day period commencing on the date of the Transfer Notice (or before a
Transfer Notice is formally delivered), to effect and close a disposition of
the number and class(es)/series of Equity Interests specified in the Transfer
Notice (or a portion of them) to a Person that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (following consultation with independent gaming
regulatory counsel) is not an Unsuitable Person, on terms agreed between the
Unsuitable Person and such Person (an " _Alternate Private Transaction_ "),
_it being_ _agreed_ that in the event that the Board fails to make a
determination in good faith that such Person is not an Unsuitable Person
within fifteen (15) days from the date on which the Corporation was presented
in writing with the identity of such Person and materials reasonably
sufficient to make such determination, then the Unsuitable Person shall be
entitled to consummate the Alternate Private Transaction with such Person. In
the case of a sale and transfer to the Corporation, from and after the
Transfer Date and subject only to the right to receive the Purchase Price for
such Equity Interests, such Equity Interests shall, be deemed no longer
outstanding and such Unsuitable Person or any Affiliate of such Unsuitable
Person shall cease to be a stockholder with respect to such Equity
Interests, and all rights of such Unsuitable Person or any Affiliate of such
Unsuitable Person therein, other than the right to receive the Purchase
Price, shall cease.

(b) In the case of an Alternate Private Transaction or a transfer
to one or more Third Party Transferees otherwise determined by the Board of
Directors above, from and after the earlier to occur of: (i) the Transfer
Date, in the case of a transfer to one or more such Third Party Transferees,
or (ii) consummation of an Alternate Private Transaction, subject only to the
right to receive the Purchase Price for such Unsuitable Person's Equity
Securities, all rights and entitlements of the Unsuitable Person or any such
Affiliates of an Unsuitable Person as a stockholder of the Corporation shall
be terminated, including without limitation any such Person shall from such
date no longer be entitled to: (i) receive any dividend, payment, distribution
or interest with regard to the applicable Equity Interests which has been
declared following such date or of which the due payment date according to the
applicable declaration is following such date, other than the right to
receive the Purchase Price, or (ii) to exercise, directly or indirectly or
through any proxy, trustee, or nominee, any voting or other right (including
without limitation observer and information rights) conferred by the
underlying Equity Interests.

  



  

(c) The closing of a sale and transfer contemplated by clauses (a)
and (b) above in this Article XII, other than an Alternate
Private Transaction (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the principal
office of the Corporation or via electronic exchange of documents on the
Transfer Date. At the Closing: (i) the Corporation or Third Party
Transferee(s) (as applicable), shall deliver the aggregate applicable
Purchase Price for the Equity Interests being purchased by each of the
foregoing by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified in writing by the Unsuitable Person in the case of Third Party
Transferees, by unsecured promissory note in the case of the Corporation, or
combination of both in the case of the Corporation in such proportion as the
Corporation may determine in its sole and absolute discretion and (ii) the
Unsuitable Person or Affiliate of such Unsuitable Person (as applicable)
shall deliver to the Corporation or each such Third Party Transferee (if
applicable), such stock powers, assignment instruments and other agreement as
are necessary or appropriate to fully convey all right, title and interest in
and to the Equity Interests being purchased by each of the foregoing, free
and clear of all liens and other encumbrances (other than restrictions on
transfer under these Amended and Restated Articles, the Bylaws of the
Corporation, the Stockholders Agreement and applicable federal and state
securities laws) and to evidence the subordination of any promissory note if
and only to the extent required by any debt obligations of the Corporation
(and to the minimum extent required pursuant to such
subordination arrangement). Such stock powers, assignment instruments and
other agreements shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Corporation and shall include no representations and warranties other than
such representations and warranties as to title and ownership of the Equity
Interests being sold, due authorization, execution and delivery of relevant
documents by the Unsuitable Person or any such Affiliates of such Unsuitable
Person (as applicable), and the enforceability of relevant obligations of such
party under the relevant documents). Under any promissory note, an amount
equal to one-third of the principal amount and the interest accrued thereon
shall be due and payable no later than three (3) months following the Transfer
Date, and the remaining principal amount of any such promissory note together
with any unpaid interest accrued thereon shall be due and payable no later
than one (1) year following the Transfer Date; _provided_ that in the event
that the Corporation does not have funds available to make the first payment,
the Corporation and the Unsuitable Party agree to negotiate an alternate
payment structure (including whether or not the promissory note or payment
obligation should be secured by assets of the Corporation) in good faith
(except that in the event that the Corporation and the Unsuitable Person are
unable to reach an amicable solution as to such alternate payment
structure, the original payment schedule and terms set out in first part of
this sentence shall remain in force, and the applicable amounts under the
promissory note shall be due and payable in accordance with the payment
schedule set out above). The unpaid principal of any such promissory note
shall bear interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum, and such
promissory note shall contain such other reasonable and customary terms and
conditions as the Corporation reasonably determines necessary or advisable,
_provided _ that they do not include any unduly burdensome or unreasonably
adverse terms to the Unsuitable Person, it being agreed that such terms may
include, without limitation, prepayment at the maker's option at any time
without premium (other than the interest agreed herein) or penalty and
subordination if and only to the extent required by any debt obligations of
the Corporation (and to the minimum extent required pursuant to such
subordination arrangement). The sale and transfer of the applicable
Equity Interests shall be effected at the Closing upon delivery of the
Purchase Price described in this Section 1(c) without regard to the provision
by the Unsuitable Person or Affiliate of such Unsuitable Person (as
applicable) of the stock powers, assignment instruments and other agreements
described above (and subject to their terms described above) and the
Corporation may in its sole and absolute discretion execute and deliver such
instruments or other documents described above necessary to effect such
transfer under such terms (including any stock powers, assignment instruments
and other agreements) and deemed by the Corporation in its sole and absolute
discretion (acting in good faith) to be necessary or advisable in its name or
in the name and on behalf of the Unsuitable Person or any Affiliate of such
Unsuitable Person (as applicable) to effect the sale and transfer; _provided_
,  _however_ , that the Unsuitable Person or Affiliate of such Unsuitable
Person (as applicable) shall continue to have the obligation to the
Corporation and the Third Party Transferees, as applicable, to provide such
stock powers, assignment instruments and other agreements.

  



  

  

(d) To the extent that a sale and transfer to one or more Third
Party Transferees is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for
any reason, the Corporation shall be permitted to redeem or repurchase the
Equity Interests owned or controlled by an Unsuitable Person or an Affiliate
of an Unsuitable Person (as applicable) for the price and under the terms
contemplated by this Article XII promptly following any such determination.

Unsuitable Person that owns or controls Equity Interests shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Corporation and its Affiliated Companies for any and all

result of, or arising out of, such Unsuitable Person's or
Affiliate's continuing ownership or control of Equity Interests following the
Transfer Date in breach of this Article XII, the neglect, refusal or other
failure to comply in any material respect with the provisions of this Article
XII, or failure to divest itself of any Equity Interests when and in the
specific manner required by the Gaming Laws or this Article XII and by

an Unsuitable Person shall be deemed to have agreed to so indemnify the
Corporation.

purchase or cause to be purchased Equity Interests pursuant to this Article
XII shall not be exclusive of any other rights the Corporation may have or

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XII, the Corporation,
the Unsuitable Person and any of his or its Affiliates shall have the right

the Transfer Notice, enter into an agreement or other arrangement (including
based on any agreement that may be reached between the applicable Gaming
Authority and an Unsuitable Person or its Affiliates in this regard) ,
including, without limitation, a divestiture trust or divestiture plan, which

Affiliate of such Unsuitable Person (including, without limitation, as to the
purchase price at which the Equity Interests can be sold) shall apply and
prevail over the terms of this Article XII.

any material Gaming License of the Corporation or any of its Affiliated
Companies, _provided_ that any forced disposal of Equity Interests shall be

provisions of this Article XII for the purpose of determining whether any
Person is an Unsuitable Person and for the orderly application,
administration and implementation of the provisions of this Article XII,
_provided_ that the provisions of any such bylaws, regulations and procedures
shall not be more adverse in any material respect to the Stockholders (as
defined in the Stockholders Agreement) than the provisions of this Article
XII. Such procedures and regulations shall be kept on file with the Secretary
of the Corporation, the secretary of its Affiliated Companies and with the
transfer agent, if any, of the Corporation and any Affiliated Companies, and
shall be made available for inspection and, upon reasonable request, mailed to
any record holder of Equity Interests. The Board of Directors shall have

 _Article I_

  



  

 _Stockholders_

  



  

1. _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation for the election of directors to succeed directors whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before such meeting shall be held each year at the place, date and time determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ " or the " _Board_ "). The Board of Directors may postpone, reschedule or cancel any annual meeting of stockholders previously scheduled by the Board.

  



  

2. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation may be called only in the manner set forth in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation (the " _Articles of Incorporation_ "). The notice for every special meeting shall state the place (if any), date, hour and purposes of the meeting. Except as otherwise required by law, only the purposes specified in the notice of the special meeting shall be considered or dealt with at such special meeting. The Board of Directors may postpone, reschedule or cancel any special meeting of stockholders previously scheduled by the Board.

  



  

3. _Place of Meeting_. Meetings of stockholders may be held at such place, either within or without the State of Nevada, as may be designated in the notice of meeting. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communications, including by webcast, in accordance with applicable law. The Board of Directors may also, in its sole discretion, determine that stockholders and proxy holders may attend and participate by means of remote communications in a stockholder meeting held at a designated place. As to any meeting where attendance and participation by remote communications authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion (including any meeting held solely by remote communications), and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt for any meeting, stockholders and proxy holders not physically present at such meeting of the stockholders shall be entitled to: (i) participate in any meeting of the stockholders; and (ii) be deemed present in person and vote at such meeting of the stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communications, _provided that_ (A) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communications is a stockholder or proxy holder, (B) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (C) if any stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communications, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.

  



  

   

 



    



  

4. _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided by law or the Articles of Incorporation, written notice of each meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, such notice to specify the place, if any, date and time of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes of the meeting. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given to stockholders, any notice shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to (in a manner consistent with the Nevada Revised Statutes (the " _NRS_ ")) by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time, if delivered by electronic mail when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice, and if delivered by any other form of electronic transmission when directed to the stockholder. Notice of the time, place, if any, and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived (i) in writing signed by the person entitled to notice thereof or (ii) by electronic transmission made by the person entitled to notice, either before or after such meeting. Notice will be waived by any stockholder by his or her attendance thereat in person, by remote communications, or by proxy, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given. For purposes of these Bylaws, " _electronic transmission_ " means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, including the use of, or participation in, one or more electronic networks or databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or databases), that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.

If, on any issue, voting by the holders of classes or series is required by Chapter 78 or 92A of the NRS, the Articles of Incorporation or these amended and restated bylaws (these " _Bylaws_ "), the holders of at least a majority of the voting power, present in person, by means of remote communications, or represented by proxy, within each such class or series is necessary to constitute a quorum of each such class or series. For purposes of the foregoing, where a separate vote by class or classes is required for any matter, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person, by means of remote communications, or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. Two or more classes or series of stock shall be considered a single class if the holders thereof are entitled to vote together as a single class at the meeting. The stockholders present at a duly constituted meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to reduce the voting shares below a quorum.

  



  

6. _Adjournments_. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors or by the vote of the holders of a majority of the votes properly cast upon the question, whether or not a quorum is present, to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than sixty (60) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Articles of Incorporation (if any such authority is so vested), each
stockholder of record, or such stockholder's duly authorized proxy, shall be
entitled to one (1) vote for each share of voting stock standing registered in
such stockholder's name at the close of business on the record date. So long

other proportion of stock shall refer to such majority or other proportion of
the votes of such stock.

(b) All matters at any meeting at which a quorum is present,
except the election of directors, shall be decided by the affirmative vote of
the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Corporation present in person or represented by proxy
at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter in question, unless
otherwise expressly provided by express provision of the Articles of
Incorporation, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to

the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a plurality of the votes of
the outstanding shares of common stock present in person or represented by

of its own stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Corporation may vote
shares which it holds in a fiduciary capacity to the extent permitted by law.

  



  

(c) Stockholders may vote either in person or by written proxy
or express directly or by written proxy their consent or dissent to a
corporate action taken without a meeting. Each such proxy shall be valid

irrevocable and, if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient to support an irrevocable power. A duly executed proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as,
it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power, regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an
interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A
stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the
meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking
the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the
Secretary of the Corporation. Proxies shall be filed with the secretary of
the meeting, or of any adjournment thereof. Except as otherwise limited

supplemented and updated from time to time to the extent necessary so that
the information provided or required to be provided in such notice shall be
true and correct (x) as of the record date for determining the stockholders
entitled to notice of the meeting and (y) as of the date that is 15 days
prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, _provided
that_  if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote

Any Stockholder Notice relating to the nomination of directors must also

The Corporation may also require any proposed nominee to furnish such other
information, including completion of the Corporation's
directors questionnaire, as it may reasonably require to determine whether
the nominee would be considered "independent" as a director or as a member of
the audit committee of the Board of Directors under the various rules and
standards applicable to the Corporation.

  



  

Any Stockholder Notice with respect to a matter other than the nomination of
directors must contain (i) the text of the proposal to be

of Directors is increased and either all of the nominees for director or the
size of the increased Board of Directors is not publicly announced or
disclosed by the Corporation at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary
of the preceding year's annual meeting, a Stockholder Notice shall also be
considered timely hereunder, but only with respect to nominees for any new
positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary
of the Corporation at the principal executive office of the Corporation not
later than the close of business on the tenth day following the first date all

(c) For any matter to be brought properly before a special meeting of
stockholders, the matter must be set forth in the Corporation's notice of the
meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors. In the event
that the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose
of electing one or more persons to the Board of Directors, any stockholder may
nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such

Directors may participate in meetings of the Board of Directors by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all Directors participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting in accordance herewith shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

10. _Action without a Meeting_. Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or committee thereof consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and such writings or electronic transmissions are filed with the records of the meetings of the Board of Directors or committee thereof. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form. Such consent shall be treated as a vote of the Board of Directors or committee thereof for all purposes.

  



  

11. _Committees_. The Board of Directors, by vote of a majority of the Directors then in office, may establish one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more Directors, and may delegate thereto some or all of its powers except those which by law or by the Articles of Incorporation may not be delegated. Except as the Board of Directors may otherwise determine, any such committee may make rules for the conduct of its business, but in the absence of such rules its business shall be conducted so far as possible in the same manner as is provided in these Bylaws for the Board of Directors. In the absence of a provision by the Board or a provision in the rules of such committee to the contrary, a majority of the entire authorized number of members of such committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless the committee has only one or two members, in which case a quorum shall be one member, or unless a greater quorum is established by the Board. The vote of a majority of the members present at a meeting of the committee at the time of such vote if a quorum is then present shall be the act of such committee. All members of such committees shall hold their committee offices at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors may abolish any committee at any time. Each such committee shall report its action to the Board of Directors who shall have power to rescind any action of any committee without retroactive effect.

1. _Certificates of Stock and Uncertificated Shares_. Unless the Board of Directors has provided by resolution that some or all of any or all classes or series of stock of the Corporation shall be uncertificated shares, each stockholder shall be entitled to a certificate of stock of the Corporation in such form as may from time to time be prescribed by the Board of Directors.

entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the

enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by
the Board. The right to indemnification conferred in Article Ninth. and this
Article Tenth. shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be
paid by the corporation for the expenses incurred in defending any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an " _advancement
of expenses_ "); provided, however, that, if the General Corporation Law of
Delaware so requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in
his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity
in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon
delivery to the corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such
indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such
expenses under Article Ninth. and this Article Tenth. , the General
Corporation Law of Delaware or otherwise (hereinafter an " _undertaking_ ").

(b) _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under paragraph (a)
above is not paid in full by the corporation within ninety (90) days after a
written claim has been received by the corporation, the indemnitee may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit or in
a suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to
be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. If the
indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
General Corporation Law of Delaware, then in (i) any suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses)
such failure shall be a defense, and (ii) in any suit by the corporation to
recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking,
the corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon such a final
adjudication. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee
is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, nor
an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the
indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of
such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right hereunder, or by the corporation
to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is entitled to be
indemnified or to such advancement of expenses under Article Ninth. and this
Article Tenth. or otherwise shall be on the indemnitee. Notwithstanding
anything contained to the contrary in Article Ninth. and this Article Tenth.
, no potential indemnitee shall be entitled to advancement of expenses under
this Certificate of Incorporation or the by-laws of the corporation, unless
authorized by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board, in any
action involving a proceeding by the corporation directly against the
indemnitee for any claim by the corporation against the indemnitee involving a
breach of fiduciary duty of the indemnitee to the corporation, or gross
negligence, bad faith, intentional misconduct, unlawful conduct or other
forms of misconduct by the indemnitee where the corporation is seeking damages
against the indemnitee.

(c) _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses conferred by this Article Ninth. and this Article
Tenth. shall not be exclusive of any other rights which any person may have
or hereafter acquire under any statute, this Certificate of
Incorporation, by-laws of the corporation, contract or agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

  



  

(d) _Insurance_. The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation
or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would
have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

  



  

(e) _Indemnification of Employees or Agents of the Corporation_. The
corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board,
grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses, to any
employee or agent of the corporation to the fullest extent of the
provisions of this Article Eighth with respect to the indemnification and
advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the corporation.

and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case as may be

Corporation, annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time, to
reconvene at the same or some other place, if any, thereof, and the means of

Bylaws, the holders of a majority of the voting power of all shares of
capital stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting,

entitled to vote on a matter, either (i) the holders of such class so present

time to time in the manner provided by Section 1.4(b) of these Bylaws until a
quorum of such class shall be so present or represented or (ii)

than announcement at the meeting.

  



  

(b)  Shares of the Corporation's own capital stock belonging, on the
record date for determining stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote
at the meeting, to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of
the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other
corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither
be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation
to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a
fiduciary capacity.

  



  

Section 1.6.   _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders of the
Corporation shall be presided over by the Chair, if any, or, in the absence
of the Chair or if the Chair is unable to act, by the Vice Chair, if any, or,

assistant secretary of the Corporation or if neither is able to act, the
chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the
meeting. The order of business at each such meeting shall be as determined by
the chairperson of the meeting. The chairperson of the meeting shall have the
right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to
do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper
conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of
procedures for the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time

record according to the books of the Corporation held by such stockholder who
has voting power upon the matter in question.

  



  

   

-3-

 



    



  

(b)  Each stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote at a
meeting of stockholders of the Corporation or to express consent or dissent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person
or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be
voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides
for a longer period or is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

  



  

(c)  A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it
is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power, regardless of whether the
interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an
interest in the Corporation generally; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
stockholder of the Corporation may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable
by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in
writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date
with the Secretary. Voting at meetings of stockholders of the Corporation
need not be by written ballot and need not be conducted by inspectors unless
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock
of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon present in person or represented
by proxy at such meeting shall so determine.

  



  

(d)  Any election of Directors by stockholders shall be determined by
a plurality of the votes cast, except where a larger vote or different vote
is required by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws. In
all other matters, unless otherwise provided by applicable law or by the
Charter or these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the shares of the Corporation present in person or represented by proxy at
the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of
the stockholders of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.8.   _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of
Record_.

  



  

(a)  In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders of
the Corporation entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation or any adjournment thereof or, if necessary, any postponement
thereof effected pursuant to Section 1.4(b) of these Bylaws, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than
ten days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes
a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the
stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting unless the
Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a
later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making
such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders of the Corporation entitled to
notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders of the Corporation shall
be at the close of business in the State of Delaware on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business in the State of Delaware on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of the
Corporation of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting
or, if necessary, any postponement of the meeting effected pursuant to
Section 1.4(b) of these Bylaws; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders of the
Corporation entitled to vote at the adjourned or, if necessary, any postponed
meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders
of the Corporation entitled to notice of such adjourned or postponed meeting
the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of
stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this Section 1.8 at the adjourned or
postponed meeting.

  



  

   

-4-

 



    



  

(b)  In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders of
the Corporation entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten
days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders of the
Corporation entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by
applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent
setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, to
its principal place of business, to an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders of the Corporation are recorded or otherwise (taking into
account any processes and procedures instituted by the Corporation pursuant to
Section 6.6 of these Bylaws). Delivery made to the Corporation's registered
office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and
prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the
record date for determining stockholders of the Corporation entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the
close of business in the State of Delaware on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

  



  

(c)  In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders of
the Corporation entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of
stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date
shall be not more than sixty days prior to the effectiveness of such action.
If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders of
the Corporation for any such purpose shall be at the close of business in the
State of Delaware on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution relating thereto.

  



  

Section 1.9.   _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The Secretary
shall prepare, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, a complete list of the stockholders of the Corporation entitled
to vote at the meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , if the record date for
determining the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote is less than
ten days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders of
the Corporation entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting
date, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Nothing in this Section 1.9 shall require the Corporation to
include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on
such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder of
the Corporation for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at
least ten days prior to the meeting: (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic
network;  _provided_ that the information required to gain access to such
list is provided with the notice of the meeting; or (b) during ordinary
business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. If the
meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders of the
Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the
time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be
examined by any stockholder of the Corporation who is present. If the
meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then such list
shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder of the Corporation
during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic
network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided
with the notice of the meeting. In the event that the Corporation determines
to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take
reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the Corporation.

Section 1.10.   _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_.

  



  

(a)  Unless otherwise provided in the Charter, any action required by
applicable law to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders
of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth
the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock of
the Corporation having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall
be delivered to the Corporation by delivery (i) to its registered office in
the State of Delaware by hand or by certified mail or registered mail, return
receipt requested, (ii) to its principal place of business, (iii) to an
officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders of the Corporation are recorded or
(iv) otherwise (taking into account any processes and procedures instituted by
the Corporation pursuant to Section 6.6 of these Bylaws).

  



  

(b)  No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate
action referred to therein unless written consents signed by a sufficient
number of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation in the
manner required by this Section 1.10 within sixty days of the first date on
which a written consent is so delivered to the Corporation.

  



  

(c)  A facsimile, message via electronic mail or other electronic
transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a
stockholder of the Corporation or proxyholder, or by a person or persons
authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be
written and signed for the purposes of this Section 1.10; _provided_ , that
any such facsimile, message via electronic mail or other electronic
transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the
Corporation can determine (i) that the facsimile, message via electronic mail
or other electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder of the
Corporation or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the
stockholder or proxyholder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or
proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such facsimile,
message via electronic mail or other electronic transmission. No consent
given by such facsimile, message via electronic mail or other electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is:
(i) reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to
the Corporation by delivery (A) to its registered office in the State of
Delaware by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, (B) to its principal place of business, (C) to an officer or agent
of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of
meetings of stockholders are recorded or (D) otherwise (taking into
account any processes and procedures instituted by the Corporation pursuant
to Section 6.6 of these Bylaws); or (ii) stored electronically pursuant to
Section 6.6 of these Bylaws. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on
delivery, consents given by facsimile, message via electronic mail or other
electronic transmission, may be otherwise delivered to the principal place of
business of the Corporation, to an officer or agent of the Corporation having
custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are
recorded or otherwise (taking into account any processes and procedures
instituted by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6.6 of these Bylaws) if, to
the extent and in the manner provided by resolution of the Board of Directors,
these Bylaws or the Charter. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable
reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the
original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing
could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall
be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.

  



  

   

-6-

 



    



  

(d)  Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a
meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those
stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been
taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the
record date for such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by
a sufficient number of stockholders to take the action were delivered to the
Corporation as provided in this Section 1.10.

  



  

(e)  Any person executing a consent may provide, whether through
instruction to an agent or otherwise, that such a consent will be effective
at a future time (including a time determined upon the happening of an event),
no later than sixty days after such instruction is given or such provision is
made, if evidence of such instruction or provision is provided to the
Corporation. Unless otherwise provided, any such consent shall be revocable
prior to its becoming effective.

determined upon the happening of an event or events, in which case it shall
be effective at such later date or upon the happening of such event or
events, and unless otherwise specified therein, no acceptance of such
resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. The Board of Directors
may remove any officer of the Corporation with or without cause at any time by

of the Corporation, such other employee of the Corporation authorized in
writing by the President or any vice president of the Corporation, with such
limitations or restrictions as may be authorized by the Board of Directors.

Directors may deem necessary or desirable, the President or the Board of
Directors may delegate for the time being the powers or duties of such officer
to any other officer or to any director. The Board of Directors may require

or all classes or series of the Corporation's stock shall be uncertificated
shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares of the Corporation
represented by a certificate theretofore issued until such certificate is
surrendered to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a
resolution or resolutions by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock of
the Corporation represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a
certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation by any two authorized
officers of the Corporation, representing the number of shares of stock in
the Corporation owned by such holder. If such certificate is manually signed
by one officer or manually countersigned by a transfer agent or by a
registrar, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile or
other reliable reproduction. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar
who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a
certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar
before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with
the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or
registrar at the date of issue. Except as otherwise expressly provided by
applicable law, the rights and obligations of the holders of
uncertificated shares of the Corporation and the rights and obligations of
the holders of certificates representing stock of the same class and series
of stock of the Corporation shall be identical.

Issuance of New Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of
stock or, if applicable, uncertificated shares of the Corporation in the place
of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner's legal representative, to
give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that
may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction
of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or
uncertificated shares.

Section 6.3.   _Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders,

under applicable law or any provision of the Charter or these Bylaws, a
written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver
by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.

such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express
purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of
any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither
the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special

waiver of notice unless so required by the Charter or these Bylaws.

Section 6.4.   _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a)   _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. The Corporation
shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, any person who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise
involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise, and
whether by or in the right of the Corporation, its stockholders, a third
party or otherwise (a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he is or
was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a Director or
officer of the Corporation serving at its request as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, against all expense (including, but not limited to,
attorneys' fees), liability, loss, judgments, fines, excise taxes,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by
him in connection with such Proceeding, including expenses incurred in
seeking such indemnification. In addition, the Corporation shall grant such
indemnification to each of its Directors and officers with respect to any
matter in a Proceeding as to which his liability is limited pursuant to the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation. However, such
indemnification shall exclude (i) indemnification with respect to any improper
personal benefit which a Director or officer is determined to have received
and of the expenses of defending against an improper personal benefit claim
unless the Director or officer is successful on the merits in said defense,
and (ii) indemnification of present or former officers, directors, employees
or agents of a constituent corporation absorbed in a merger or consolidation
transaction with this Corporation with respect to their activities prior to
said transaction, unless specifically authorized by the Board of Directors or
stockholders of this Corporation. Such indemnification shall include prompt
payment of expenses reasonably incurred by a Director or officer in defending
a Proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director or officer to repay
such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to
be indemnified by the Corporation under this Section 6.4, which undertaking
shall be an unsecured general obligation of the Director or officer and may
be accepted without regard to his or her ability to make repayment.

  



  

(b)   _Indemnification of Employees and Agents_. The Corporation may,
to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant
rights to indemnification and to an advancement of expenses, pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 6.4, to any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding by
reason of the fact that he is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation
or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation, as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise.

  



  

(c)   _Nature of Indemnification Rights_. The indemnification rights
provided in this Section 6.4 shall be a contract right and shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person, whether or not
entitled to be indemnified hereunder, may be entitled by law or under any
bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or Directors or otherwise, both as to
action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
Director, officer, employee or agent and inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such a person. A Director or officer shall be
entitled to the benefit of any amendment of the DGCL which enlarges
indemnification rights hereunder, but any such amendment which adversely
affects indemnification rights with respect to prior activities shall not
apply to him without his consent unless otherwise required by law. Each
person who is or becomes a Director or officer of the Corporation shall be
deemed to have served or to have continued to serve in such capacity in
reliance upon the indemnity provided for in this Section 6.4.

  



  

(d)   _Amendment_. The provisions of this Section 6.4 may be amended
as provided in Section 6.8; _provided_ , _however_ , no amendment or repeal
of such provisions which adversely affects the rights of a Director or officer
under this Section 6.4 with respect to his acts or omissions prior to such
amendment or repeal, shall apply to him without his consent.

Section 6.5.   _Interested Directors; Quorum_. No contract or other
agreement, understanding, arrangement or instrument or transaction between
the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the
Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other
organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors
or officers or equivalents, or have a financial interest, shall be void or
voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is
present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or
committee thereof that authorizes the contract or other
agreement, understandings arrangement or instrument or transaction, or solely
because his or her or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (a) the
material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the
contract or other agreement, understanding, arrangement or instrument or
transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the
committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes
the contract or other agreement, understanding, arrangement or instruments or
transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested
directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; (b)
the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the
contract or other agreement, understanding, arrangement or instruments or
transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders of the Corporation
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or other agreement, understanding,
arrangement or instruments or transaction is specifically approved in
good faith by vote of the stockholders of the Corporation; or (c) the
contract or other agreement, understanding, arrangement or instruments or
transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized,
approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the
stockholders of the Corporation. Common or interested directors may be counted
in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of
Directors or of a committee that authorizes the contract or other
agreement, understanding, arrangement or instruments or transaction.

  



  

Section 6.6.   _Form of Records_. Any records administered by or on
behalf of the Corporation in the regular course of its business, including

books of account, and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, any
information storage device or method, or one or more electronic networks or
databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or
databases); _provided_ that the records so kept can be converted into
clearly legible form within a reasonable time, and with respect to the stock
ledger, that the records so kept satisfy clauses (i) through (iii) of Section
224 of the DGCL. The Corporation shall so convert any records so kept upon the
request of any person entitled by law to inspect such records in accordance
with law.

  



  

Section 6.7.   _Conflict with Applicable Law or Certificate of
Incorporation_. These Bylaws are adopted subject to any applicable law and
the Charter. Whenever these Bylaws may conflict with any applicable law or the
Charter, such conflict shall be resolved in favor of such law or the Charter,
as applicable.

  



  

Section 6.8.   _Amendment or Repeal_. These Bylaws may be amended or
repealed or additional Bylaws adopted by the stockholders or by the Board of
Directors; provided that (a) the Board of Directors may not amend or repeal
Section 6.4 or this Section 6.8 or any provision of these Bylaws which by
law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws requires action by
the stockholders, and (b) any amendment or repeal of these Bylaws by the
Board of Directors and any Bylaw adopted by the Board of Directors may

Section 6.01 Registration Statement.

  



  

The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the Closing, but in any event
within thirty (30) days following the date of this Agreement, file
a Registration Statement under the Securities Act to permit the public resale
of all the Registrable Securities held by the Stockholders from time to time
as permitted by Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar
provision adopted by the Commission then in effect) on the terms and
conditions specified in this _Section 6.01_ and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared
effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but in any
event no later than the earlier of (i) sixty (60) days (or one hundred twenty
(120) days if the Commission notifies the Company that it will "review" the
Registration Statement) after the date of this Agreement and (ii) the tenth
(10th) Business Day after the date the Company is notified (orally or in
writing, whichever is earlier) by the Commission that such Registration
Statement will not be "reviewed" or will not be subject to further review
(such earlier date, the "Effectiveness Deadline"). The Registration Statement
filed with the Commission pursuant to this _Section 6.01_ shall be on Form S-1
or such other form of registration statement as is then available to effect a
registration for resale of such Registrable Securities, covering
such Registrable Securities, and shall contain a Prospectus in such form as
to permit any Stockholder to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision
adopted by the Commission then in effect) at any time beginning on the
effective date for such Registration Statement. A Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this _Section 6.01_ shall provide for the resale pursuant to any
method or combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, the
Stockholders. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause a
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 6.01_ to remain
effective, and to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to
ensure that such Registration Statement is available or, if not available,
that another registration statement is available, for the resale of all the
Registrable Securities held by the Stockholders until all such Registrable
Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities. As soon as
practicable following the effective date of a Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this _Section 6.01_ , but in any event within three (3) Business
Days of such date, the Company shall notify the Stockholders of the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement. When effective, a Registration
Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 6.01_ (including any documents
incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any Prospectus
contained in such Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances
under which such statement is made).

  



  

Section 6.02 Underwritten Offering.

  



  

(a) In the event that (i) following the expiration of the DK/SBT
Lockup Period, any DK Stockholder or any SBT Stockholder and/or
(ii) following the expiration of the DEAC Lockup Period, any DEAC Stockholder
elects to dispose of Registrable Securities under a Registration Statement
pursuant to an Underwritten Offering of all or part of such Registrable
Securities that are registered by such Registration Statement and reasonably
expect aggregate gross proceeds in excess of [$75,000,000] (the " _Minimum
Amount_ ") from such Underwritten Offering, then the Company shall, upon the
written demand of such Stockholders (any such Stockholder a " _Demanding
Holder_ " and, collectively, the " _Demanding Holders_ "), enter into an
underwriting agreement in a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings of
equity securities with the managing Underwriter or Underwriters selected by
the Company after consultation with the Demanding Holders and shall take all
such other reasonable actions as are requested by the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall have
no obligation to facilitate or participate in more than two (2)
Underwritten Offerings pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ for each of the DK
Stockholders Group, the SBT Stockholder Group and the DEAC Stockholder Group
(and not more than six (6) Underwritten Offerings for all Stockholders in the
aggregate) (the " _Underwritten Offerings Cap_ "); _provided_ _further_
that if an Underwritten Offering is commenced but terminated prior to
the pricing thereof for any reason, such Underwritten Offering will not be
counted as an Underwritten Offering pursuant to this _Section 6.02_.

  



   

-16- 

 



    

  



  

(b) _Notice_. In addition, the Company shall give prompt written
notice to each other Stockholder regarding such proposed Underwritten
Offering, and such notice shall offer such Stockholder the opportunity to
include in the Underwritten Offering such number of Registrable Securities as
each such Stockholder may request. Each such Stockholder shall make such
request in writing to the Company within five (5) Business Days after the
receipt of any such notice from the Company, which request shall specify the
number of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such
Stockholder. In connection with any Underwritten Offering contemplated by
this _Section 6.02_ , the underwriting agreement into which each Demanding
Holder and the Company shall enter shall contain such representations,
covenants, indemnities (subject to _Section 6.05_ ) and other rights and
obligations as are customary in underwritten offerings of equity securities.
No Demanding Holder shall be required to make any representations or
warranties to or agreements with the Company or the Underwriters other than
representations, warranties or agreements regarding such Demanding Holder's
authority to enter into such underwriting agreement and to sell, and its
ownership of, the securities being registered on its behalf, its intended
method of distribution and any other representation required by law.

  



  

(c) _Reduction of Underwritten Offering._ If the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering, in good faith,
advises the Company and the Demanding Holders that the dollar amount or number
of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders desire to sell, taken
together with all Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company or
any other Stockholder desires to sell and the shares of Common Stock, if any,
as to which a Registration has been requested pursuant to separate written
contractual piggy-back registration rights held by any other stockholders who
desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of equity
securities that can be sold in the Underwritten Offering without adversely
affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution method,
or the probability of success of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or
maximum number of such securities, as applicable, the " _Maximum Number of
Securities_ "), then the Company shall include in such Underwritten Offering,
as follows:

  



  

i. _first_ , the Registrable Securities of the Demanding Holders
pro rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
Demanding Holder has requested be included in such Underwritten Offering and
the aggregate number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders
have requested be included in such Underwritten Offering that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;

  



  

ii. _second_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i), Common Stock
or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and

  



  

iii. _third_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities
has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i) and clause (ii), Common
Stock or other equity securities of (x) other Stockholders who have elected to
participate in the Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 6.02(a)_ or (y)
persons or entities that the Company is obligated to register in a
Registration pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements with such
persons, pro rata, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities.

(d) A Demanding Holder shall have the right to withdraw all or any
portion of its Registrable Securities included in an Underwritten Offering
pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ for any or no reason whatsoever upon written
notification to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters of its
intention to withdraw from such Underwritten Offering prior to the pricing
of such Underwritten Offering and such withdrawn amount shall no longer be
considered an Underwritten Offering (including, without limitation, for
purposes of the Underwritten Offerings Cap); _provided_ , _however_ , that
upon the withdrawal of an amount of Registrable Securities that results in
the remaining amount of Registrable Securities included by the Demanding
Holders in such Underwritten Offering being less than the Minimum Amount, the
Company shall cease all efforts to complete the Underwritten Offering and,
for the avoidance of doubt, such Underwritten Offering shall not count against
the Underwritten Offerings Cap. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with an Underwritten Offering prior to its withdrawal
under this _Section 6.02(d)_.

  



  

Section 6.03 Piggyback Registration Rights.

  



  

(a) If at any time the Company proposes to file a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an Underwritten
Offering of equity securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable
or exchangeable for, or convertible into equity securities, for its own
account or for the account of stockholders of the Company (or by the Company
and by the stockholders of the Company including, without limitation,
pursuant to _Section 6.02_ hereof) on a form that would permit registration of
Registrable Securities, other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in
connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an
exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the Stockholders, (iii) for
an offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the
Company, (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan or (v) on Form S-4, then the
Company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to all of the
Stockholders as soon as practicable but not less than ten (10) days before the
anticipated filing date of such Registration Statement, which notice shall
(A) describe the amount and type of securities to be included in such
offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed
managing Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, in such offering, and (B) offer
to all of the Stockholders the opportunity to register the sale of such number
of Registrable Securities as such Stockholders may request in writing within
five (5) days after receipt of such written notice (in the case of an
"overnight" or "bought" offering, such requests must be made by the
Stockholders within one (1) Business Day after the delivery of any such
notice by the Company) (such Registration a " _Piggyback Registration_ "); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company has been advised by the managing
Underwriter(s) that the inclusion of Registrable Securities for sale for the
benefit of the Stockholders will have an adverse effect on the price, timing
or distribution of the Common Stock in the Underwritten Offering, then (A) if
no Registrable Securities can be included in the Underwritten Offering in the
opinion of the managing Underwriter(s), the Company shall not be required to
offer such opportunity to the Stockholders or (B) if any Registrable
Securities can be included in the Underwritten Offering in the opinion of the
managing Underwriter(s), then the amount of Registrable Securities to be
offered for the accounts of Stockholders shall be determined based on the
provisions of _Section 6.03(b)_.

  



  

   

-18- 

 



    



  

(b) Subject to _Section 6.03(a)_ , the Company shall, in good faith,
cause such Registrable Securities to be included in such Piggyback
Registration and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested by the Stockholders pursuant to
this _Section 6.03_ to be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same
terms and conditions as any similar securities of the Company included in
such Registration and to permit the sale or other disposition of such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof. If no written request for inclusion from a Stockholder
is received within the specified time, each such Stockholder shall have no
further right to participate in such Underwritten Offering. All such
Stockholders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Offering under this _Section 6.03_ shall enter into
an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected
for such Underwritten Offering by the Company.

  



  

(c) If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten
Offering that is to be a Piggyback Registration, in good faith, advises the
Company and the Stockholders participating in the Piggyback Registration that
the dollar amount or number of shares of Common Stock that the Company
desires to sell, taken together with (i) the shares of Common Stock, if any,
as to which Registration has been demanded pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the
Stockholders hereunder, (ii) the Registrable Securities as to which
registration has been requested pursuant to _Sections 6.01_ and _6.02_ , and
(iii) the shares of Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been
requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration
rights of other stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of
Securities, then:

  



  

i. If the Registration is undertaken for the Company's account,
the Company shall include in any such Registration:

  



  

(A) _first_ , shares of Common Stock or other equity securities that
the Company desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities;

  



  

(B) _second_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities
has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), pro rata to the
Registrable Securities of Stockholders exercising their rights to register
their Registrable Securities pursuant to _Sections 6.02_ and _6.03_ hereof;
and

  



  

(C) _third_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities
has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), shares of
Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been requested pursuant to
written contractual piggy-back registration rights of other stockholders of
the Company, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities;

  



  

ii. If the Registration is pursuant to a request by persons or
entities other than the Stockholders, then the Company shall include in any
such Registration

  



  

(A) _first_ , shares of Common Stock or other equity securities, if
any, of such requesting persons or entities, other than the Stockholders,
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;

  



  

   

-19- 

 



    



  

(B) _second_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities
has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), pro rata to the
Registrable Securities of Stockholders exercising their rights to register
their Registrable Securities pursuant to _Sections 6.02_ and _6.03_ hereof;

  



  

(C) _third_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities
has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), shares of
Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell,
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and

  



  

(D) _fourth_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities
has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), shares of
Common Stock or other equity securities for the account of other persons or
entities that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with such persons or entities, which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

iii. Any Stockholder shall have the right to withdraw from a
Piggyback Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written
notification to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of
its intention to withdraw from such Piggyback Registration prior to the
pricing of such Underwritten Offering. The Company (whether on its own good
faith determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons
pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a
Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its withdrawal
under this _Section 6.03_.

  



  

(d) For purposes of clarity, any Registration effected pursuant to
_Section 6.03_ hereof shall not be counted as a Registration effected under
Section _6.02_ hereof.

  



  

Section 6.04 Company Procedures.

  



  

(a) _General Procedures_. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to effect the Registration of Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended plan of distribution thereof, and pursuant
thereto the Company shall, as expeditiously as practicable:

  



  

i. prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-
effective amendments to the Registration Statement, and such supplements to
the Prospectus, as may be required by the rules, regulations or instructions
applicable to the registration form used by the Company or by the Securities
Act or rules and regulations thereunder to keep the Registration Statement
effective until all of such Registrable Shares have been disposed of (if
earlier) in accordance with the intended plan of distribution set forth in
such Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus;

  



  

   

-20- 

 



    



   



  

ii. prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the Underwriters,
if any, and the Stockholders included in such Registration, and to one legal
counsel selected by such Stockholders, copies of such Registration Statement
as proposed to be filed, each amendment and supplement to such Registration
Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein), the Prospectus included in such
Registration (including each preliminary Prospectus), and such other
documents as the Underwriters and the Stockholders included in such
Registration or the legal counsel for any such Stockholders may request in
order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by
such Stockholders.

  



  

iii. prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use
its best efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities
covered by the Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws
of such jurisdictions in the United States as the Stockholders included in
such Registration Statement (in light of their intended plan of
distribution) may request and (ii) take such action necessary to cause such
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered
with or approved by such other Governmental Authorities as may be necessary by
virtue of the business and operations of the Company and do any and all other
acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the Stockholders
included in such Registration Statement to consummate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify or take any
action to which it would be subject to general service of process or taxation
in any such jurisdiction where it is not then otherwise so subject;

  



  

iv. cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each
securities exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities
issued by the Company are then listed;

  



  

v. provide a transfer agent or warrant agent, as applicable, and
registrar for all such Registrable Securities no later than the effective
date of such Registration Statement;

  



  

vi. advise each seller of such Registrable Securities, promptly
after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of
any stop order by the Commission suspending the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for
such purpose and promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the
issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order
should be issued;

  



  

vii. at least five (5) days prior to the filing of any Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such Registration
Statement furnish a copy thereof to each seller of such Registrable Securities
and its counsel, including, without limitation, providing copies promptly
upon receipt of any comment letters received with respect to any such
Registration Statement or Prospectus;

  



  

viii. notify the Stockholders at any time when a Prospectus relating
to such Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the

includes a Misstatement, and then to correct such Misstatement as set forth in
_Section 6.04(c)_ hereof;

  



  

   

-21-

 



    



  

ix. permit a representative of the Stockholders (such
representative to be selected by a majority of the
participating Stockholders), the Underwriters, if any, and any attorney or
accountant retained by such Stockholders or Underwriter to participate, at
each such person's own expense, in the preparation of the Registration
Statement, and cause the Company's officers, directors and employees to
supply all information reasonably requested by any such representative,
Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with the Registration;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such representatives or Underwriters enter
into a confidentiality agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, prior to the release or disclosure of any such
information; and provided further, the Company may not include the name of any
Stockholder or Underwriter or any information regarding any Stockholder or
Underwriter in any Registration Statement or Prospectus, any amendment or
supplement to such Registration Statement or Prospectus, any document that is
to be incorporated by reference into such Registration Statement or
Prospectus, or any response to any comment letter, without the prior written
consent of such Stockholder or Underwriter and providing each such
Stockholder or Underwriter a reasonable amount of time to review and comment
on such applicable document, which comments the Company shall include unless
contrary to applicable law;

  



  

x. obtain a "cold comfort" letter from the Company's independent
registered public accountants in the event of an Underwritten Registration
which the participating Stockholders may rely on, in customary form and
covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "cold comfort"
letters as the managing Underwriter may reasonably request, and reasonably
satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of the participating Stockholders;

  



  

xi. on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale
pursuant to such Registration, obtain an opinion, dated such date, of counsel
representing the Company for the purposes of such Registration, addressed to
the Stockholders, the placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the
Underwriters, if any, covering such legal matters with respect to the
Registration in respect of which such opinion is being given as the
Stockholders, placement agent, sales agent, or Underwriter may reasonably
request and as are customarily included in such opinions and negative
assurance letters, and reasonably satisfactory to a majority in interest of
the participating Stockholders;

perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and
customary form, with the managing Underwriter of such offering;

  



  

xiii. make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve
(12) months beginning with the first day of the Company's first full calendar
quarter after the effective date of the Registration Statement which
satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158
thereunder (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission);

  



  

   

-22-

 



    



  

xiv. if the Registration involves the Registration of Registrable
Securities involving gross proceeds in excess of $25,000,000, use its
reasonable efforts to make available senior executives of the Company to
participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be reasonably
requested by the Underwriter in any Underwritten Offering; and

  



  

xv. otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take
such customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Stockholders, in
connection with such Registration.

  



  

(b) _Registration Expenses_. The Registration Expenses of all
Registrations shall be borne by the Company. It is acknowledged by the
Stockholders that the Stockholders shall bear all incremental selling expenses
relating to the sale of Registrable Securities, such as Underwriters'
commissions and discounts, brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing costs and,
other than as set forth in the definition of " _Registration Expenses_ ," all
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel representing the
Stockholders.

  



  

(c) _Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings_. No
person may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity securities of
the Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company hereunder
unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis
provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Company and
(ii) completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary
documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements.

  



  

(d) _Suspension of Sales ; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of
written notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus
contains a Misstatement, each of the Stockholders shall forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities until he, she or it has received copies
of a supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it
being understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such
supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the time of such
notice), or until he, she or it is advised in writing by the Company that the
use of the Prospectus may be resumed (any such period, a "Suspension
Period"). If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a
Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at any time would
require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or would require the
inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial statements that are
unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond the Company's control, the
Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the Holders,
delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such
Registration Statement for the shortest period of time, but in no event more
than thirty (30) days, determined in good faith by the Company to be
necessary for such purpose (any such period, a "Blackout Period". In the
event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the
Stockholders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice
referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to any Registration in
connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. The Company
shall immediately notify the Stockholders of the expiration of any period
during which it exercised its rights under this Section 6.04(d).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.04, in no event
shall any Suspension Period or any Blackout Period continue for more than
ninety (90) days in the aggregate during any 365-day period.

  



  

   

-23-

 



    



  

(e) _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Stockholder shall own
Registrable Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a
reporting company under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain
extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period)
all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant
to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly furnish the
Stockholders with true and complete copies of all such filings. The Company
further covenants that it shall take such further action as any Stockholder
may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to
enable such Stockholder to sell shares of Common Stock held by such
Stockholder without registration under the Securities Act within the
limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the
Commission), including providing any legal opinions. Upon the request of any
Stockholder, the Company shall deliver to such Stockholder a written
certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it has complied with
such requirements.

  



  

Section 6.05 Indemnification and Contribution

  



  

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by
law, each Stockholder, its officers and directors and each person
who controls such Stockholder (within the meaning of the Securities Act)
against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material
fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary
Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar
as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in
writing to the Company by such Stockholder expressly for use therein. The
Company shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers and directors and
each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect
to the indemnification of the Stockholder.

  



  

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a
Stockholder is participating, such Stockholder shall furnish to the Company
in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably requests
for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus and,
to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company, its directors and
officers and agents and each person who controls the Company (within the
meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable
attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material fact
contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission
is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such
Stockholder expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the obligation
to indemnify shall be several, not joint and several, among such Stockholders
of Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Stockholder of
Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and limited to the net
proceeds received by such Stockholder from the sale of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. The Stockholders shall
indemnify the Underwriters, their officers, directors and each person who
controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the
same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of
the Company.

  



  

   

-24-

 



    



  

(c) Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give
prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to
which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt
notice shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to
the extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party)
and (ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If
such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (plus local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such
indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between
such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect
to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money
(and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of
such settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified
party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

(d) The indemnification provided for under this _Article VI_ shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person
of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The
Company and each Stockholder participating in an offering also agrees to make
such provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified party for
contribution to such party in the event the Company's or such Stockholder's
indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

  



  

(e) If the indemnification provided under _Section 6.05_ hereof from
the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; provided, however, that the
liability of any Stockholder under this _Section 6.05(e)_  shall be limited
to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Stockholder in such
offering giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party
as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 6.05(a),
(b)_ and _(c)_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably
incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. The
parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this subsection _Section 6.05(e)_ were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this  _Section
6.05(e)_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
pursuant to this _Section 6.05(e)_ from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

Agreement, in whole or in part, except in connection with such Transfer of
Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section 3.02_.

  



  

(b) _Other Registration Rights_. The Company represents and
warrants that no Person, other than a Stockholder, has any right to require
the Company to register any securities of the Company for sale or to include
such securities of the Company in any Registration filed by the Company for
the sale of securities for its own account or for the account of any other
person. Further, the Company represents and warrants that this Agreement
supersedes any other registration rights agreement or agreement with similar
terms and conditions and in the event of a conflict between any such agreement
or agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.
