ARTICLE 2 
 The Merger 

   

 _Section 2.01. The Merger. _(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Louisiana Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") with those characteristics set out in Article 3. 

  

 (b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days, after the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree. 

  

 (c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall (i) file a certificate of merger and the Amended and Restated Company Charter with the 

   ##### 

  

 

Louisiana Secretary of State and (ii) make all other filings or recordings
required by Louisiana Law necessary to effect the Merger (such certificates
and other filings set forth in clauses (i) through (ii), the "Certificate of
Merger"). The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective
Time") as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed (or at such later time
as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger). 

   

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Louisiana Law. 

  

 _Section 2.02. Conversion of Shares. _At the Effective Time: 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.09, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $8.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest. 

  

 (b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary, or any of their Affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 _Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. _(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title 

   ##### 

  

 

shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

   

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares 

   ##### 

  

 

of Company Stock eighteen months after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for shares of Company Stock for which rights to receive payment of the fair value of such shares have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand of Parent. 

  

 _Section 2.04. Equity Awards. _(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Stock granted under the Companys 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, or the Companys 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, (each, a "Company Stock Plan" and each such option, a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay each such holder at or promptly after the Effective Time for each such cancelled Company Stock Option an amount, less any applicable withholding for Taxes (the "Option Consideration"), in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of Company Stock subject to the Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of the Company Stock Option) had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted share of Company Stock (whether subject to service-based or performance-based vesting conditions) (each, a "Company Restricted Share") granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding shall become fully vested, and shall be treated as a share of Company Stock for all purposes of this Agreement (including the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02). 

  

 (c) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each performance unit with respect to Company Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan (each, a "Company Performance Unit" and, together with the Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares, "Company Equity Awards"), shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay each such holder at or promptly after the Effective Time for each such Company Performance Unit, an amount in cash, less any applicable withholding for Taxes (the "Performance Unit Consideration" and, together with the Option Consideration and the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Restricted Shares, the "Equity Award Consideration"), equal to (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock issuable pursuant to such Company 

   ##### 

  

 

Performance Unit assuming attainment of the target level of performance
applicable to such Company Performance Unit (or such other level of
performance if provided for in the award agreement underlying such Company
Performance Unit. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary such that, effective as of the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Equity Award shall be canceled in exchange for the applicable Equity Award Consideration (if any), including (i) obtaining any consents from holders of Company Equity Awards that are required under the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and (ii) amending, to the extent necessary and to the extent such amendment is permitted by the terms of such Company Equity Award or Company Stock Plan, the terms of such Company Equity Awards or Company Stock Plan to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.04, payment may be withheld in respect of any Company Stock Options or Company Performance Units until any required consents of the holder of such Company Stock Options or Company Performance Units, as applicable, are obtained. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Equity Awards with an intrinsic value of zero or less immediately preceding the Effective Time shall be canceled without any payment or other consideration therefor and the holder of such Company Equity Award shall have no rights whatsoever with respect to such cancelled Company Equity Award. 

  

 _Section 2.05. Convertible Securities. _At the Effective Time, Companys 2.75% Senior Convertible Debentures due 2027 (the "Debentures") shall remain outstanding and shall be treated in accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges that the Merger will constitute a "Fundamental Change" as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures and that the holders of such Debentures shall have the rights related thereto under such indenture. The Company will provide prior notice of such Fundamental Change in accordance with the terms of the Debentures. 

  

 _Section 2.06. Adjustments. _If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, and without prejudice to Section 6.01, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise or cancellation of any Company Stock Options or settlement or cancellation of any Company Performance Units outstanding as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 2.07. Withholding Rights. _Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  

 _Section 2.08. Lost Certificates. _If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2. 

  

 _Section 2.09. Dissenting Shares. _Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has voted against the Merger and who has properly exercised dissenters rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 12:131 of the Louisiana Law shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such shares shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with Section 12:131 of the Louisiana Law, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to payment of the fair value of such shares under the Louisiana Law. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to payment of the fair value of such shares under the Louisiana Law, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company pursuant to Section 12:131 of the Louisiana Law, and Parent, at Parents expense, shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands so long as Parent does not create any obligations for the Company effective prior to the Effective Time. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

(other than a confidentiality agreement with a Third Party permitted under
Section 6.03(b)). It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on the
Company set forth in this Section by any Representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed a breach of this Section by the

 (i) the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party (and its Representatives or financing sources) that has made after the date of this Agreement a Superior Proposal or Acquisition Proposal that the Board reasonably believes will lead to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that such Superior Proposal or Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach by the Company of Section 6.03(a); (B) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives and financing sources non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (C) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise cooperate, assist, facilitate and encourage such Third Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not take any of the actions described in clauses (B) and (C) above unless and until the Company has entered into a confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent) with such Third Party with terms (including with respect to the standstill provisions) no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the confidentiality agreement dated July 13, 2011 between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"); _provided, however,_ that (1) such confidentiality agreement may contain a less restrictive standstill restriction or no standstill restriction, in which case the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to contain only such less restrictive provision, or to omit such provision, as applicable, and (2) all such non-public information (to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party); and 

   

 (ii) the Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal 

   ##### 

  

   

counsel, that (A) an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or (B) in the absence of an
Acquisition Proposal, if due to events or changes in circumstances after the
date hereof that were neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the
Company as of or prior to the date hereof, the failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law. 

  

 In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this Section 6.03; _provided,_ that any such action taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such action, (ii) issuing a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act (which it is agreed shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), or (iii) causing the Company to make any factually accurate public statement that describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to this clause (iii), the Company shall, to the extent practicable, provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to comment on and review any such statement, if such statement is to be made and released in a writing. 

  

 (c) _Required Notices_. 

   

 (i) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than by 5:00 p.m., Houston time, on the next calendar day) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, including of the material terms and conditions thereof and for the avoidance of doubt the identity of the party making the Acquisition Proposal, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed as to the status (including changes to the material terms) of such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall also notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than by 5:00 p.m., Houston time, on the next Business Day) after receipt by the Company of any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in each case by any Third Party that has informed the Company that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) The Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.03(b)(ii)(B) unless the Company has notified Parent that the Board intends to make such an Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the facts and information constituting the basis for such contemplated determination, and until a period commencing on the date that such notice is deemed received by Parent in accordance with Section 11.01 and ending at 5:00 pm, Houston time, on the fifth Business Day thereafter has elapsed.

 (ii) the Superior Proposal Notice is accompanied by the agreement referred to in clause (i) of this Section 6.03(d) and all other documentation to be entered into by the Company or, to the extent known and available to the Company, by any of the Companys Representatives in connection with such Superior Proposal; and 

   

 (iii) a period commencing on the date that the Superior Proposal Notice is deemed to be received by Parent in accordance with Section 11.01 and ending at 5:00 p.m., Houston time, on the fifth Business Day thereafter (such five-Business Day period, the "Notice Period") has elapsed and the Company has not received from Parent a written proposal to amend the terms of this Agreement that the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, to be at least as favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Companys stockholders as the transactions described in the Superior Proposal Notice. 

  

 It is understood and agreed that, upon the expiration of a Notice Period, if the Company has not received from Parent a written proposal to amend the terms of this Agreement that the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, to be at least as favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Companys stockholders as the transactions described in the Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i) at any time thereafter. It 

   ##### 

  

 

is also understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or
other material terms of a Superior Proposal after delivery of a Superior
Proposal Notice in respect of such Superior Proposal shall require delivery
of another Superior Proposal Notice and another Notice Period in respect of
such Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 6.03(d)(iii), except that,
assuming Parent has been afforded at least one Notice Period of at least five
Business Days in respect of a Superior Proposal from such Third Party, any
and each such subsequent Notice Period shall expire at 5:00 p.m., Houston
time, on the second Business Day after the date that such subsequent
Superior Proposal Notice is deemed received by Parent in accordance with
Section 11.01. 

   

 (e) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal for all of the outstanding shares of Company Stock or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority vote, after considering the advice of a financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account all relevant factors, (i) if accepted, is reasonably expected to be consummated on the terms and conditions proposed, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, and (ii) if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable, from a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders than provided hereunder (taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(d)). 

  

 (f) _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure all such certifications as promptly as practicable. If any such Person fails to provide any required certification within the time period allotted in the relevant confidentiality agreement (or if no such period is specified, then within a 

   ##### 

  

 

reasonable time period after the date hereof), then the Company shall take
all actions that may be reasonably necessary to secure its rights and ensure
the performance of such other partys obligations thereunder as promptly as
practicable.

   ##### 

  

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the director or officer of the Company to whom

Section 7.03(a). 

   

 (b) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations articles of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are substantially equivalent to and in any event no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of such tail policy and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent with respect thereto. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are substantially equivalent to and in any event no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such 

    ##### 

 

  

policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 200%

amount is set forth in Section 7.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under Louisiana Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights under this Section 7.03 shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and his heirs and representatives. 

  

 _Section 7.04. Post-Closing Employee and Employment Benefit Matters._ 

  

 (a) For the one year period following the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Period"), with respect to each employee of the Company or any Subsidiary as of the Effective Time (the "Current Employees"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Company or a Subsidiary to, as applicable, provide to each such Current Employee (i) the same or greater base salary or base rate of pay and target bonus opportunities as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits (including, if applicable, post-termination health and welfare benefits) that are no less favorable than the severance benefits such Current Employee was eligible for immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) such other compensation and employee benefits that, with respect to such Current Employee, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided by the Company or Subsidiary, as applicable, to such Current Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company to, honor all obligations under the Employee Plans and International Plans in accordance with their respective terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or 

   ##### 

  

 

in any Employee Plan or International Plan, for purposes of any Employee Plan
or International Plan containing a definition of "change in control" or
"change of control", the Merger shall be deemed to constitute a "change in
control" or "change of control". 

   

 (c) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (each a "Parent Employee Plan") in which any Current Employee or any dependent thereof is eligible or participates after the Effective Time, such Current Employee shall receive full credit for service with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company or a Subsidiary currently provides such past service credit) for all purposes (including benefit accrual), to the same extent that such service was recognized as of the Effective Time under a comparable plan of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries in which such Current Employee participated; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. 

  

 (d) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and any of its Subsidiaries) in which any Current Employee or any dependent thereof participates from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company welfare benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all expenses incurred by each Current Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Current Employee or dependent participates from and after the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) The provisions contained in this Section 7.04 with respect to Current Employees are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right in any other person, including any employee, former employee, or any participant in any Employee Plan or International Plan (or beneficiary of any of the foregoing), including any right to continued (or resumed) employment with Parent, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and no provision of this Section 7.04 shall constitute an amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any Employee Plan. 

  

 _Section 7.05. No Other Representations or Warranties. _Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees that, except for the representations and warranties made by the Company that are expressly set forth in Article 4, the Company has 

   ##### 

  

 

not made and shall not be deemed to have made any representation or warranty
of any kind. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for the
representations and warranties made by the Company that are expressly set
forth in Article 4, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees that neither
the Company, nor any of their respective Representatives, makes or has made
any representation or warranty to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their
respective Representatives with respect to: 

   

 (a) any projections, forecasts or other estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their respective Representatives; or

For the avoidance of doubt, the 

   ##### 

  

 

obligations set forth in this Section 8.01(a) shall not be deemed breached as
a result of actions by the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives
that are permitted by Section 6.03. 

   

 (b) In furtherance of Section 8.01(a), (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable, but no later than 10 Business Days, following the execution of this Agreement, the parties shall make all filings under the HSR Act, and (ii) as promptly as practicable, but no later than 20 Business Days (unless an earlier filing is required by Applicable Law), following the execution of this Agreement, the parties shall make all filings under the analogous laws existing in foreign jurisdictions set forth in _Section 8.01(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively with the HSR Act, the "Premerger Notification Rules"). Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filings under any Premerger Notification Rules. Unless otherwise agreed, Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt expiration of any applicable waiting period under any Premerger Notification Rules. Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply with any request for information from any Governmental Authority charged with enforcing, applying, administering, or investigating any Applicable Law designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization, restraining trade or abusing a dominant position (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"), including the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, any attorney general of a state of the United States or any other competition authority of any jurisdiction ("Antitrust Authority"). Parent and the Company shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from any Antitrust Authority. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in any proceedings or negotiations with any Antitrust Authority or other Person relating to any of the foregoing, and each party shall afford the other party a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussion with any Antitrust Authority relating to the foregoing.

Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to avoid possible rejection or deferred acceptance of the Exon-Florio Filing under 31 C.F.R. Section 800.403, 

   ##### 

  

 

respond to any inquiries from CFIUS or any other Governmental Authority
involved in the Exon-Florio review and, if applicable, investigation within
the time frame set forth in 31 C.F.R. Section 800.403(a)(3), and make any
other submissions under Exon-Florio that are required to be made or that the
parties agree should be made. Parent and Company shall use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain a notification from CFIUS or, if applicable, the
President of the United States that the review or investigation under Exon-
Florio has been concluded.

A "Burdensome Condition" means any action that, individually or in the aggregate, has an impact that is material and adverse on the benefits or value that Parent expects to receive in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or requires Parent to agree to hold separate or to divest any of the material businesses, services, properties or assets of either Parent, on the one hand, or the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this Section 8.01(d), each of the Global 1200 and Global 1201 shall be material properties.

Subject to Section 6.03, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Subject to Section 6.02, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another in setting a mutually acceptable date for the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement.

The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with (1) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and (2) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the Companys response to those comments and to provide comments on that response, including by participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

   ##### 

  

 

its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after
the SEC indicates that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement.
Except as contemplated by Section 6.03(b), no amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement shall be filed without the approval of both the Company and
Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party hereto that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. 

   

 (b) The Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act and applicable state "blue sky" laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 _Section 8.04. Further Assurances. _At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or 

   ##### 

  

 

assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 (e) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; 

 

 _provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.05
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice. 

   

 _Section 8.06. Stock Exchange De-listing; 1934 Act Deregistration. _Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company Stock under the 1934 Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than 10 days after the Closing Date.

The Company agrees to submit to the Maritime Administration its request for the Title XI Consent within 10 Business Days of the date hereof. Parent agrees to cooperate with the Company in the preparation and submission of such request and in obtaining the Title XI Consent. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such request before it is submitted. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties hereto understand and agree that the reasonable best efforts of the Company under this Section 8.08 shall not be deemed to include any payment of a fee in connection with the Title XI Consent unless Parent shall reimburse the Company for such payment within three Business Days.

Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 _Section 11.13. Specific Performance. _The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached, and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without the posting of any bond and without proof of actual damages, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of New York or any New York state court, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
