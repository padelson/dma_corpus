         received pursuant to this Section 2.2.2 are referred to herein as the
         "Merger Consideration"; and

         2.2.3.  each LVCI Common Share held by LVCI, TLC or Merger Subsidiary
         shall be cancelled and extinguished without any consideration therefor.


2.3.     SURRENDER AND PAYMENT

         2.3.1. Prior to the Effective Time, TLC shall appoint an agent
         reasonably acceptable to LVCI (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of
         exchanging certificates representing LVCI Common Shares ("Old
         Certificates"). As of the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
         deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of LVCI
         Common Shares for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.3, through
         the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the TLC Common Shares
         issuable pursuant to Section 2.2 in exchange for outstanding LVCI
         Common Shares ("New Certificates").

         2.3.2. Promptly after the Effective Time, TLC will send, or will cause
         the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of LVCI Common Shares at the
         Effective Time a letter of transmittal reasonably acceptable to LVCI
         for use in exchanging such holder's Old Certificates for the New
         Certificates (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected,
         and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
         Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent).

         2.3.3. Each holder of LVCI Common Shares that have been converted into
         a right to receive TLC Common Shares, upon surrender to the Exchange
         Agent of Old Certificates, together with a properly completed letter of
         transmittal covering such Old Certificates, shall receive in exchange
         therefor (a) that number of whole TLC Common Shares which such holder
         has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2; (b) cash in lieu of
         fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5; and (c) any dividends or
         distributions the payout date for which shall have occurred, and the
         Old Certificates so surrendered shall be cancelled. Until so
         surrendered, each Old Certificate shall, after the Effective Time,




                                     - 11 -


<PAGE>   17

         represent for all purposes, only the right to receive upon such
         surrender the New Certificates representing TLC Common Shares, cash in
         lieu of any fractional TLC Common Shares as contemplated by this
         Section 2.3 and Section 2.5 and any dividends or distributions.

         2.3.4. If any TLC Common Shares are to be issued to a Person other than
         the registered holder of the LVCI Common Shares represented by the Old
         Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition
         to such issuance that the Old Certificates shall be properly endorsed
         or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
         requesting such issuance shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer
         tax or other taxes required as a result of such issuance to a Person
         other than the registered holder of such LVCI Common Shares or
         establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
         such tax has been paid or is not payable.

         2.3.5. At the Effective Time, holders of LVCI Common Shares shall cease
         to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of LVCI, other than
         the right to receive any dividend or other distribution with respect to
         such LVCI Common Shares with a record date occurring prior to the
         Effective Time and the consideration provided under this Article 2.
         After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
         transfers of LVCI Common Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Old
         Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
         cancelled and exchanged for New Certificates as provided for, and in
         accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

         2.3.6. Any New Certificates made available to the Exchange Agent
         pursuant to Section 2.3.1 that remain unclaimed by the holders of LVCI
         Common Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to
         TLC, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his or her
         LVCI Common Shares in accordance with this Section 2.3 prior to that
         time shall thereafter look only to TLC to exchange such LVCI Common
         Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation and
         TLC shall not be liable to any holder of LVCI Common Shares for any
         amount paid, or any TLC Common Shares delivered to a public official
         pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any TLC Common Shares
         or amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of LVCI Common Shares two
         years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior
         to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
         property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted
         by applicable Law, become the property of TLC free and clear of any
         claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

         2.3.7. No dividends or other distributions on TLC Common Shares shall
         be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificates until such
         Old Certificates are surrendered as provided in this Section. Upon such
         surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in
         whose name the New Certificates representing the TLC Common Shares into
         which such shares were converted are registered, all dividends and
         other distributions paid in respect of such TLC Common Shares on a date
         subsequent to, and in respect of a record date after, the Effective
         Time.

         2.3.8. If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
         destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
         claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the
         posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as TLC may
         direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or
         the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Old Certificate, TLC
         shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate,
         deliver or cause the Exchange Agent to deliver a New Certificate in
         respect thereof pursuant to this Section 2.3.

2.4.     ADJUSTMENTS

         If, at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, the outstanding TLC Common Shares or LVCI Common Shares
are changed into a different number of shares, by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, reverse stock
split, consolidation, exchange or readjustment of shares, stock dividend or
similar transaction with a record date (or where there is no record date,
effective date) during such period, the Conversion Number shall be appropriately
adjusted.


2.5.     FRACTIONAL SHARES

         No fractional TLC Common Shares shall be issued in the Merger. All
fractional TLC Common Shares that a holder of LVCI Common Shares would otherwise
be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a
fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to
receive, in lieu thereof, an amount (in U.S. dollars) in cash (without interest)
determined by multiplying the Average TLC Trading Price by the fraction of a TLC
Common Share to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.
Alternatively, the Surviving Corporation shall have the option of instructing
the Exchange Agent to aggregate all fractional TLC Common Shares, sell such
shares in the public market and distribute to holders of LVCI Common Shares a
pro rata portion of the proceeds of such sale. No such cash in lieu of
fractional TLC Common Shares shall be paid to any holder of LVCI Common Shares
until Old Certificates are surrendered and exchanged in accordance with Section
2.3.

         4.11.2. Except as disclosed in the LVCI Disclosure Letter, (i) to the

         LVCI Material Adverse Effect, and such Tax Returns are complete and
         correct;

         4.15.2. Except as disclosed in the LVCI SEC Filings, no deficiency in
         payment of any Taxes for any period has been asserted by any taxing
         authority which remains unsettled at the date hereof except for

         individually or in the aggregate, an LVCI Material Adverse Effect;

         4.15.3. LVCI is not liable and it is not reasonably likely that LVCI
         will be liable for any Taxes not heretofore paid or reserved against in
         LVCI's April 30, 2001 financial statements except those incurred in the

         4.15.4. There are no Actions now pending or made or, to the knowledge

         collected, or credited to any person the amount of Taxes required to be

         applicable Laws.

         will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible
         securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any Person

         affect TLC's acquisition or retention of such control.

         4.16.3. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between TLC
         and LVCI or between Merger Subsidiary and LVCI.

         4.16.4. LVCI is not an investment company as such term is defined in

         similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

         4.16.6. On the date of the Merger, the fair market value of the assets

         liabilities, if any, to which the assets are subject.

         4.16.7. LVCI agrees to treat the Merger as a Reorganization. This
         Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
         the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g)

         knowingly taken any action that would jeopardize the qualification of
         the Merger as a Reorganization. During the period from the date of this
         Agreement through the Effective Time, unless all parties hereto shall
         otherwise agree in writing, LVCI shall not knowingly take or fail to
         take any action which action or failure would jeopardize the
         qualification of the Merger as a Reorganization. LVCI shall cause one
         or more of its responsible officers to execute and deliver certificates
         to confirm the accuracy of certain relevant facts as may be reasonably
         requested by counsel in connection with the preparation and delivery of
         the tax opinion described in Section 9.1.8.


4.17.    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

         4.17.1. LVCI and its Subsidiaries own or are licensed to use all
         Intellectual Property Rights currently used in the business of LVCI or
         its Subsidiaries or necessary to conduct the business of LVCI and its

         an LVCI Material Adverse Effect.

         4.17.2. Except as set forth in the LVCI Disclosure Letter, LVCI and its

         Liens, and other than as set forth in the LVCI Disclosure Letter, to

         or reasonably be expected to have an LVCI Material Adverse Effect.

         4.17.4. Except as disclosed in the LVCI SEC Filings, neither LVCI nor
         any of its Subsidiaries: (A) has been notified or is otherwise aware of
         any actual or threatened adverse proceeding of any Person pertaining to
         any challenge to the scope, validity or enforceability of, or LVCI's
         ownership of, any of the LVCI Intellectual Property Rights; (B) is the
         subject of any claim of infringement or misappropriation by LVCI or any
         of its Subsidiaries of any third party Intellectual Property Rights; or

4.18.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

         4.18.1. "LVCI Employee Plans" shall mean each "employee benefit plan",
         as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, which (i) is subject to any
         provision of ERISA and (ii) is maintained, administered or contributed
         to by LVCI or any affiliate and covers any employee or former employee
         of LVCI or any affiliate or under which LVCI or any



                                     - 24 -
<PAGE>   30
         affiliate has any Liability. The LVCI Disclosure Letter contains a
         complete and correct list of each Employee Plan. With respect to each
         LVCI Employee Plan, true and complete copies have been made available
         to TLC of: (i) the plan document or agreement or, with respect to any
         LVCI Employee Plan that is not in writing, a written description of the
         terms thereof; (ii) the trust agreement, insurance contract or other
         documentation of any related funding arrangement; (iii) the summary
         plan description; (iv) the most recent required Internal Revenue
         Service Form 5500, including all schedules thereto; (v) any material
         communication to or from any Governmental Authority, including a
         written description of any material oral communication; and (vi) all
         amendments or modifications to any such document. For purposes of this
         Section 4.18.1, "affiliate" of any Person means other Person which,
         together with such Person, would be treated as a single employer under
         Section 414 of the Code.

         4.18.2. No LVCI Employee Plan individually or collectively constitutes
         a "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA.

         4.18.3. No LVCI Employee Plan or LVCI Benefit Arrangement constitutes a
         "multi-employer plan", as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, and no
         LVCI Employee Plan is maintained in connection with any trust described
         in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No LVCI Employee Plan is subject to
         Title IV of ERISA. Neither LVCI nor any of its affiliates has incurred,
         nor has reason to expect to incur, any Liability under Title IV of
         ERISA arising in connection with the termination of, or complete or
         partial withdrawal from, any plan previously covered by Title IV of
         ERISA that would have, or reasonably be expected to have, individually
         or in the aggregate, an LVCI Material Adverse Effect.

         4.18.4. Nothing done or omitted to be done and no transaction or
         holding of any asset under or in connection with any LVCI Employee Plan
         has or will make LVCI or any of its Subsidiaries or any officer or
         director of LVCI or any of its Subsidiaries subject to any Liability
         under Title I of ERISA or liable for any Tax pursuant to Section 4975
         of the Code that would have, or reasonably be expected to have,
         individually or in the aggregate, an LVCI Material Adverse Effect.

         4.18.5. Each LVCI Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under
         Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has been so qualified
         during the period from its adoption to date, and each trust forming a
         part thereof is exempt from Tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code,
         and each LVCI Employee Plan has been maintained in material compliance
         with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
         statutes, Orders, final rules and final regulations, including but not
         limited to ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such LVCI
         Employee Plan.

         4.18.6. Except as disclosed in the LVCI Disclosure Letter, there is no
         contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any employee or
         former employee of LVCI or any affiliate that, individually or
         collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would
         not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code.

         plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing for compensation,
         bonus, profit-sharing, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation
         or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation, vacation
         benefits, insurance coverage (including any self-insured arrangements),
         health or medical benefits, disability benefits, workers' compensation,
         supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and

         or medical insurance or other benefits, but excluding any health,
         medical, pension or other benefit plan that is provided to employees by
         a Governmental Authority) which (i) is not an LVCI Employee Plan, (ii)
         is entered into, maintained or contributed to, as the case may be, by
         LVCI or any of its affiliates and (iii) covers any employee or former
         employee of LVCI or any of its affiliates. Copies or descriptions of
         the LVCI Benefit Arrangements have been made available to TLC. Each
         LVCI Benefit Arrangement has been maintained in compliance with its

         applicable to such LVCI Benefit Arrangement.

         4.18.8. Except as disclosed in the LVCI Disclosure Letter, the
         transactions contemplated hereby will not result in any Liability for
         severance pay to any employee or accelerate the exercisability or
         vesting of any LVCI options, warrants, stock appreciation rights,
         phantom stock awards or any similar instruments as the case may be, nor
         will any employee be entitled to any payment solely by reason of such
         transactions.

         4.18.9. All contributions required to be made to trusts in connection
         with any LVCI Employee Plan that would constitute a "defined

         been made in a timely manner in compliance with applicable law and
         regulations.

         4.18.10. Other than claims in the ordinary course for benefits with
         respect to LVCI Employee Plans or LVCI Benefit Arrangements, there are
         no Actions (including claims for Taxes, interest, penalties or fines)
         pending with respect to any LVCI Employee Plan or LVCI Benefit
         Arrangement, or any circumstances which might give rise to any such
         Action (including claims for any Taxes, interest, penalties or fines).

         4.18.11. All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to the
         LVCI Employee Plans or LVCI Benefit Arrangements required to be filed
         with any Governmental Authority have been so filed by the due date for
         such filings.

         4.18.12. LVCI does not provide, nor has it made any current or past
         commitment to provide, post-retirement health or medical benefits for
         retired employees of LVCI or its Subsidiaries, except as specifically
         required under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 of ERISA. LVCI
         has substantially complied with the notice and continuation
         requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA and
         the regulations thereunder.

         4.18.13. There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or

         relating to, or change in


                                     - 26 -
<PAGE>   32
         employee participation or coverage under, any LVCI Employee Plan or
         LVCI Benefit Arrangement which in the aggregate would increase the per
         employee expense of maintaining such LVCI Employee Plan or LVCI Benefit
         Arrangement above the level of the expense incurred on a per employee
         basis in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended on April 30, 2001
         except to the extent, with respect to all employees, that such increase
         results from premium increases in the normal course or as would not
         have, or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
         aggregate, an LVCI Material Adverse Effect.

4.19.    ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         All operations of LVCI and its Subsidiaries have been conducted, and
are now, in compliance with all Environmental Laws. Except as LVCI has publicly
disclosed in documents filed with the SEC since July 1, 1998, LVCI is not aware
that it or any Subsidiary is subject to:

         4.19.1.  any Action which relates to environmental, health or safety
         matters or any investigation or evaluation concerning environmental,
         health or safety matters; or

         4.19.2.  any demand or notice with respect to the breach of, or
         Liability under, any Environmental Laws and LVCI is not aware of facts
         or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in any
         such Action to which it or any Subsidiary would be subject and which
         could reasonably be expected to result in an LVCI Material Adverse
         Effect.

4.20.    EMPLOYEES

         4.20.1. There is no collective bargaining or other labour union
         agreement applicable to any employees of LVCI or any of its
         Subsidiaries. Neither LVCI nor any of its Subsidiaries are required to
         recognize any labour union or employee association representing its
         employees or any agent having bargaining rights for its employees and
         neither LVCI nor any of its Subsidiaries have any knowledge, after
         appropriate enquiry, of any threatened attempts to organize or
         establish any labour union or employee association with respect to its
         employee. No material work stoppage or material labour dispute against
         LVCI or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with their businesses is
         pending or, to the knowledge of LVCI, threatened and, to the knowledge
         of LVCI, there is no related organizational activity by any employees
         of LVCI or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither LVCI nor any of its
         Subsidiaries has, except as set forth in the LVCI Disclosure Letter,
         received any written notice of any material unfair labour practice in
         connection with the business, and no such complaints are pending before
         the National Labor Relations Board or other similar Governmental
         Authority.

         4.20.2. LVCI has complied in all material respects with all Laws
         applicable to it relating to employment, including those relating to
         wages, hours, collective bargaining, occupational health and safety,
         workers' hazardous materials, employment standards, pay equity and
         workers' compensation. There are no outstanding charges or complaints
         against LVCI relating to unfair labour practices or discrimination or
         under any legislation

                                     - 27 -
<PAGE>   33
         relating to employees. LVCI has paid in full all material amounts owing
         under applicable occupational health and safety legislation, and to the
         knowledge of LVCI, there are no circumstances that would permit a
         penalty assessment under such legislation. There are no Orders
         requiring LVCI to comply outstanding under applicable occupational
         health and safety legislation, except where such Order would not have
         or reasonably be expected to have an LVCI Material Adverse Effect.

         4.21.1. None of LVCI or its Subsidiaries has made any payment or loan

LVCI Disclosure Letter and except for usual compensation paid in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices.

         4.21.2. Except as disclosed in the LVCI Disclosure Letter and except

shareholder of such company or any Person not dealing with it at arm's length or
any Affiliate of any of the foregoing.

4.23.    COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS

         Except as described or provided for in any LVCI SEC Filing or as
disclosed in the LVCI Disclosure Letter, neither LVCI nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of, or has violated, any applicable provisions of
any Laws, other than violations which would not have or reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, an LVCI Material Adverse Effect.
Except as described or provided for in any LVCI SEC Filing or as disclosed in
the LVCI Disclosure Letter, LVCI and its Subsidiaries have obtained and maintain
in effect all Permits, accreditations, approvals, and consents (collectively,
the "Licenses") required by any Governmental Authority to properly and legally
operate or conduct the businesses in which LVCI and its Subsidiaries are
engaged, other than those Licenses the absence of which would not have or
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an LVCI
Material Adverse Effect. Except as described or provided for in any LVCI SEC
Filing or as disclosed in the LVCI Disclosure Letter, LVCI is not in default or
in violation of the terms of any of the Licenses and none of the Licenses are
subject to pending revocation or cancellation, other than with respect to
Licenses, the loss of

                                     - 28 -
<PAGE>   34
which would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an LVCI Material Adverse Effect.

4.24.    FINDERS' FEES

         Except for Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("Goldman"), there is no investment
banker, broker, finder or other intermediary which has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of LVCI or any of its Subsidiaries who might be
entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.


4.25.    OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR

a financial point of view.

         The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding

under this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.


4.27.    COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH CARE REQUIREMENTS

         4.27.1. To the knowledge of LVCI, LVCI and each Subsidiary is, to the
         extent applicable to their operations, (i) eligible to receive payment
         under Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act, and (ii) in
         compliance with the conditions of participation in the Medicare and
         Medicaid programs, except where such inability in the case of item (i)
         or non-compliance in the case of item (ii) does not have and is not
         reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, an LVCI
         Material Adverse Effect.

         4.27.2. LVCI and each Subsidiary are not required to file cost reports
         and other claims and governmental filings with respect to Medicare and
         Medicaid programs.

         4.27.3. To the knowledge of LVCI, neither LVCI, its Subsidiaries, nor
         any of their current or former directors, officers, managers, agents,
         employees or other persons acting on behalf of them, has offered, paid,
         solicited or received any remuneration in order to obtain or maintain
         business, which offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt is in
         violation of Law, except where such violation does not have and is not
         likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, an LVCI Material
         Adverse Effect.


4.28.    MEDICARE PARTICIPATION/ACCREDITATION

         To the extent applicable to their operations, all health care
facilities owned or operated by LVCI or any Subsidiary (each, an "LVCI
Facility") have any required certificate of need and are


                                     - 29 -
<PAGE>   35
in substantial compliance with the conditions of participation of such programs
and certificate, except where the failure to be so certified, to have such
agreements, or to be in such compliance does not have and is not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, an LVCI Material Adverse
Effect. Neither LVCI nor any Subsidiary has received notice from any
Governmental Authority, fiscal intermediary, carrier or similar entity which
enforces or administers the statutory or regulatory provisions in respect to any
governmental health care program of any pending or threatened investigations,
and to the knowledge of LVCI, no such investigations are pending, threatened or
imminent, which will have or are reasonably expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, an LVCI Material Adverse Effect. All returns, cost reports and
other filings made by LVCI or any Subsidiary with Medicare, Medicaid or any
other governmental health care program or third party payor are complete and
accurate except where the failure to be so complete and accurate is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, an LVCI Material
Adverse Effect. No adjustment or disallowance in any such costs reports and
other requests for payment, including adjustments or disallowances for late
filings, has been made or, to the knowledge of LVCI, threatened by any federal
or state agency or instrumentality or other provider reimbursement entities
relating to Medicare or Medicaid or by any third party payor which individually
or in the aggregate would have or reasonably be expected to have an LVCI
Material Adverse Effect, and, to the knowledge of LVCI, there is no basis for
any successful claims or requests for recovery of overpayments from any such
agency, instrumentality, entity or third party payor except for any such claims
or requests which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an LVCI Material Adverse Effect.


4.29.    EXCLUSION

         To the knowledge of LVCI, neither LVCI nor any Subsidiary employs or
contracts with any person who has been excluded from participation in a Federal
Health Care Program (as defined in 42 U.S.C. ss. 1320a-7b(f)) where such action
could reasonably serve as a basis for LVCI's or any Subsidiary's suspension or
exclusion from the Medicare or any state Medicaid program.

4.30.    FEDERAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS

         Neither LVCI nor any Subsidiary nor any of their officers, directors,
agents or managing employees: (a) has had a civil monetary penalty assessed
against him/her/it under Section 1128A of the Social Security Act or any
regulations promulgated thereunder; (b) has been excluded from participation
under any federal health care program (as defined in 42 U.S.C. ss. 1320a-7b(f));
or (c) has been convicted (as that term is defined in 42 C.F.R. ss. 1001.2) of
any of the categories of offenses as described in the Social Security Act
Section 1128(a) and (b)(1),(2),(3) or any regulations promulgated thereunder.


4.31.    THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT

         LVCI and each Subsidiary has a valid contract to participate as a
provider of services in and under those third-party payment programs in which it
operates. To the knowledge of LVCI, no Action is pending to suspend, limit,
terminate, or revoke the status of LVCI or any Subsidiary



                                     - 30 -
<PAGE>   36
as a provider in any such program, and neither LVCI nor any Subsidiary has been
provided notice by any such third-party payor of its intention to suspend,
limit, terminate, revoke, or fail to renew any contractual arrangement with LVCI
or any Subsidiary as a participating provider of services in whole or in part
except where any such Actions or notices are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, an LVCI Material Adverse Effect.


4.32.    BILLING

         Except as set forth in the LVCI Disclosure Letter, all billing by, or
on behalf of, any of LVCI or any Subsidiary to third-party payors, including,
but not limited to, Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies has been
true and correct in all material respects.


4.33.    REIMBURSEMENT MATTERS

         Except as disclosed in the LVCI Disclosure Letter, for the previous
three years, LVCI and its Subsidiaries have not received any written notice of
denial of payment or overpayment of a material nature from a U.S. federal health
care program or any other third party reimbursement source (inclusive of managed
care organizations) with respect to items or services provided by LVCI and/or
any Subsidiary, other than those which have been finally resolved in any
settlement for an amount less than $100,000.


4.34.    REPRESENTATIONS COMPLETE

         None of the representations or warranties made by LVCI herein or in the
LVCI Disclosure Letter, when all such documents are read together in their
entirety, contains any untrue statement of a material fact, or omits to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

                                     - 31 -
<PAGE>   37
operation, ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually

to LVCI true and complete copies of TLC's articles of incorporation and bylaws
as currently in effect.

powers and, except for any required approvals by TLC's stockholders in
connection with the Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of TLC and Merger Subsidiary. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by TLC and Merger Subsidiary and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of TLC and Merger Subsidiary.


5.3.     GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION

         The execution, delivery and performance by TLC and Merger Subsidiary of

option plan of TLC relating thereto); and (vii) compliance with any applicable
state securities or Blue Sky laws, except where the failure of any action to be
taken by any Governmental Authority or filing to be made would not have or
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a TLC Material
Adverse Effect or prevent consummation of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby.


5.4.     NON-CONTRAVENTION

         The execution, delivery and performance by TLC and Merger Subsidiary of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger by Merger Subsidiary do not

bylaws of TLC or Merger Subsidiary (except for the appointment of the LVCI
Nominees, which is conditional upon an amendment


                                     - 32 -
<PAGE>   38
being made to the articles of TLC to increase the size of the TLC Board), (ii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.3, contravene or
conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any Law or Order
binding upon or applicable to TLC or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) constitute a

any provision of any TLC Material Contract or other material agreement or other
instrument binding upon TLC or any of its Subsidiaries or any License,
franchise, Permit or other similar authorization held by TLC or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
material asset of TLC or any of its Subsidiaries, except for any occurrences or
results referred to in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) which would not have or
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a TLC Material
Adverse Effect or prevent consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.


5.5.     CAPITALIZATION

         5.5.1. The entire authorized capital stock of TLC consists of an
         unlimited number of TLC Common Shares. As of July 31, 2001, there were

         obligation of TLC to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or
         securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or voting
         securities of TLC (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being
         referred to collectively as the "TLC Securities"). Except as disclosed
         in the TLC Disclosure Letter, between the date hereof and the Effective
         Time, no TLC Securities will be issued. TLC has not issued, granted or
         awarded any phantom stock, stock appreciation rights or any similar
         instruments to any Person. There are no outstanding obligations of TLC
         or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
         any TLC Securities. The TLC Common Shares to be exchanged for LVCI
         Common Shares in the Merger have been duly authorized and allotted and
         when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of this
         Agreement, will have been validly issued and will be

<PAGE>   39
         fully paid and non-assessable and the issuance thereof is not subject

         Options have been or will be, prior to the Effective Time, duly
         authorized and the TLC Common Shares issuable on the exercise of the

         exercise of the Replacement Options will be conditionally listed on the
         TSE and NASDAQ, subject only to notice of issuance. The transactions
         contemplated hereby will not by themselves result in the TLC Rights
         under the TLC Rights Plan becoming exercisable.

         5.5.2. No bonds, debentures, notes or other evidence of indebtedness of
         TLC having the right to vote (or convertible into securities having the
         right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders may vote (the "TLC
         Voting Debt") are outstanding. Except as set forth in this Section 5.5,

         as defined in Section 368(c) of the Code.

         5.17.1. TLC and its Subsidiaries own or are licensed to use all
         Intellectual Property Rights currently used in the business of TLC or
         its Subsidiaries or necessary to conduct the business of TLC and its
         Subsidiaries as currently conducted or currently anticipated to be
         conducted (the "TLC Intellectual Property Rights") other than as would
         not have or reasonably be expected to have a TLC Material Adverse
         Effect.

         5.17.2. Except as set forth in the TLC Disclosure Letter, TLC and its
         Subsidiaries are not required to pay any royalties, fees or other

         5.17.3. TLC and its Subsidiaries have good and valid title to all TLC
         Intellectual Property Rights owned by any of them and valid and
         enforceable license rights to all TLC Intellectual Property Rights used
         under license, free and clear, to the knowledge of TLC, of all Liens,
         and other than as set forth in the TLC Disclosure Letter, to the
         knowledge of TLC, all TLC Intellectual Property Rights are in full
         force and effect and will remain in full force and effect immediately
         following the Effective Time other than as would not have or reasonably
         be expected to have a TLC Material Adverse Effect.

         5.17.4. Neither TLC nor any of its Subsidiaries: (A) has been notified
         or is otherwise aware of any actual or threatened adverse proceeding of

5.18.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

         5.18.1. "TLC Employee Plans" shall mean each U.S.-based "employee
         benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) ERISA, which is subject to
         any provision of ERISA and each Canadian based employee benefit plant
         that is maintained, administered or contributed to by TLC or any
         affiliate and covers any employee or former employee of TLC or any
         affiliate or under which TLC or any affiliate has any Liability. The
         TLC Disclosure Letter contains a complete and correct list of each TLC
         Employee Plan. With respect to each TLC Employee Plan, true and
         complete copies have been made available to LVCI of: (i) the plan
         document or agreement or, with respect to any TLC Employee Plan that is
         not in writing, a written description of the terms thereof; (ii) the
         trust agreement, insurance contract or other documentation of any
         related funding





                                     - 43 -

         arrangement; (iii) the summary plan description; (iv) the most recent
         required Internal Revenue Service Form 5500, including all schedules
         thereto; (v) any material communication to or from any Governmental
         Authority, including a written description of any oral communication;
         and (vi) all amendments or modifications to any such document. For
         purposes of this Section 5.18.1, "affiliate" of any Person means other
         Person which, together with such Person, would be treated as a single
         employer under Section 414 of the Code.

         5.18.2. No TLC Employee Plan individually or collectively constitutes a
         "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA or
         applicable Canadian legislation.

         5.18.3. No TLC Employee Plan or TLC Benefit Arrangement constitutes a
         "multi-employer plan", as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or in the
         applicable Canadian pension benefit legislation, and no TLC Employee
         Plan is maintained in connection with any trust described in Section
         501(c)(9) of the Code. No TLC Employee Plan is subject to Title IV of
         ERISA. Neither TLC nor any of its affiliates has incurred, nor has
         reason to expect to incur, any Liability under Title IV of ERISA
         arising in connection with the termination of, or complete or partial
         withdrawal from, any plan previously covered by Title IV of ERISA that
         would have, or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
         aggregate, a TLC Material Adverse Effect.

         5.18.4. Nothing done or omitted to be done and no transaction or
         holding of any asset under or in connection with any TLC Employee Plan
         has or will make TLC or any of its Subsidiaries or any officer or
         director of TLC or any of its Subsidiaries subject to any Liability
         under Title I of ERISA or liable for any Tax pursuant to Section 4975
         of the Code that would have, or reasonably be expected to have,
         individually or in the aggregate, a TLC Material Adverse Effect.

         5.18.5. Each TLC Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under
         Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has been so qualified
         during the period from its adoption to date, and each trust forming a
         part thereof is exempt from Tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code,
         and each TLC Employee Plan has been maintained in material compliance
         with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
         statutes, Orders, final rules and final regulations, including but not
         limited to applicable Canadian pension legislation, ERISA and the Code,
         which are applicable to such TLC Employee Plan.

         5.18.6. There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering
         any employee or former employee of TLC or any affiliate that,
         individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any
         amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section
         280G of the Code.

         5.18.7. "TLC Benefit Arrangement" shall mean each employment, severance
         or other similar contract, arrangement or policy and each plan or
         arrangement (written or oral) providing for compensation, bonus,
         profit-sharing, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation or
         other forms of incentive or deferred compensation, vacation

         benefits, insurance coverage (including any self-insured arrangements),
         health or medical benefits, disability benefits, workers' compensation,
         supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and
         post-employment or retirement benefits (including compensation, health
         or medical insurance or other benefits, but excluding any health,
         medical, pension or other benefit plan that is provided to employees by
         a Governmental Authority) which (i) is not a TLC Employee Plan, (ii) is
         entered into, maintained or contributed to, as the case may be, by TLC
         or any of its affiliates and (iii) covers any employee or former
         employee of TLC or any of its affiliates. Copies or descriptions of the
         TLC Benefit Arrangements have been made available to LVCI. Each TLC
         Benefit Arrangement has been maintained in compliance with its terms
         and with the requirements prescribed by any and all Laws that are
         applicable to such TLC Benefit Arrangement.

         5.18.8.  The transactions contemplated hereby will not result in any
         Liability for severance pay to any employee or accelerate the
         exercisability or vesting of any TLC options, warrants, stock
         appreciation rights, phantom stock awards or any similar instruments as
         the case may be, nor will any employee be entitled to any payment
         solely by reason of such transactions.

         5.18.9.  All contributions required to be made to trusts in connection
         with any TLC Employee Plan that would constitute a "defined
         contribution plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(34) of ERISA or
         applicable Canadian pension benefit legislation) have been made in a
         timely manner in compliance with applicable law and regulations.

         5.18.10. Other than claims in the ordinary course for benefits with
         respect to TLC Employee Plans or TLC Benefit Arrangements, there are no
         Actions (including claims for any Taxes, interest, penalties or fines)
         pending with respect to any TLC Employee Plan or TLC Benefit
         Arrangement, or any circumstances which might give rise to any such
         Action (including claims for any Taxes, interest, penalties, or fines).

         5.18.11. All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to the
         TLC Employee Plans or TLC Benefit Arrangements required to be filed
         with any Governmental Authority have been so filed by the due date for
         such filings.

         5.18.12. TLC does not provide, nor has it made any current or past
         commitment to provide, post-retirement health or medical benefits for
         retired employees of TLC or its Subsidiaries, except as specifically
         required under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 of ERISA. TLC
         has substantially complied with the notice and continuation
         requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA and
         the regulations thereunder.

         5.18.13. There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
         announcement (whether or not written) by TLC or any of its Affiliates
         relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any
         TLC Employee Plan or TLC Benefit Arrangement which in the aggregate
         would increase the per employee expense of maintaining such TLC
         Employee Plan or TLC Benefit Arrangement above the level of the expense
         incurred on a per employee basis in respect thereof for the fiscal year
         ended on May 31, 2001


                                     - 45 -
<PAGE>   51
         except to the extent, with respect to all employees, that such increase
         results from premium increases in the normal course or as would not
         have, or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
         aggregate, a TLC Material Adverse Effect.


5.19.    ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         All operations of TLC and its Subsidiaries have been conducted, and are
now, in compliance with all Environmental Laws. Except as TLC has publicly
disclosed in documents filed with the SEC since July 1, 1998, TLC is not aware
that it or any Subsidiary is subject to:

         5.19.1. any Action which relates to environmental, health or safety
         matters or any investigation or evaluation concerning environmental,
         health or safety matters; or

         5.19.2. any demand or notice with respect to the breach of, or
         Liability under, any Environmental Laws and TLC is not aware of facts
         or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in any
         such Action which it or any Subsidiary would be subject and which could
         reasonably be expected to result in a TLC Material Adverse Effect.


5.20.    EMPLOYEES

         5.20.1. There is no collective bargaining or other labour union
         agreement or employee association applicable to any employees of TLC or
         any of its Subsidiaries. Neither TLC nor any of its Subsidiaries has
         made any commitment to, or conducted any negotiation with, any labour
         union or employee association with respect to any future agreement or
         arrangement. Neither TLC nor any of its Subsidiaries are required to
         recognize any labour union or employee association representing its
         employees or any agent having bargaining rights for its employees. No
         material work stoppage or material labour dispute against TLC or any of
         its Subsidiaries in connection with their businesses is pending or, to
         the knowledge of TLC, threatened and, to the knowledge of TLC, there is
         no related organizational activity by any employees of TLC or any of
         its Subsidiaries. Neither TLC nor any of its Subsidiaries has, except
         as set forth in the TLC Disclosure Letter, received any written notice
         of any material unfair labour practice in connection with the business,
         and no such complaints are pending before the National Labor Relations
         Board or other similar Governmental Authority.

         5.20.2. TLC has complied in all material respects with all Laws
         applicable to it relating to employment, including those relating to
         wages, hours, collective bargaining, occupational health and safety,
         workers' hazardous materials, employment standards, pay equity and
         workers' compensation. Except as disclosed in the TLC Disclosure
         Letter, there are no outstanding charges or complaints against TLC
         relating to unfair labour practices or discrimination or under any
         legislation relating to employees. TLC has paid in full all material
         amounts owing under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act (Ontario) or
         comparable legislation, and to the knowledge of TLC, there are no
         circumstances that would permit a penalty reassessment under such
         legislation.

                                     - 46 -
<PAGE>   52
         There are no Orders requiring TLC to comply outstanding under the
         Occupational Health and Safety Act (Ontario) or comparable legislation,
         except where such Order would not have or reasonably be expected to
         have a TLC Material Adverse Effect.

5.21.    NON-ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTIONS

         5.21.1. None of TLC or its Subsidiaries has made any payment or loan
         to, or has borrowed any monies from or is otherwise indebted to, any
         officer, director, employee or stockholder of such company or any
         Person not dealing with it at arm's length or any Affiliate of the
         foregoing, except as disclosed in the TLC Disclosure Letter and except
         for usual compensation paid in the ordinary course of business
         consistent with past practices.

         5.21.2. Except as disclosed in the TLC 10-K and except for contracts
         made solely between TLC and its Subsidiaries and except for consulting
         contracts or contracts of employment, none of TLC or its Subsidiaries
         is a party to any contract with any officer, director, employee or
         shareholder of such company or any Person not dealing with it at arm's
         length or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing.


5.22.    COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS

         Except as described or provided for in any TLC SEC Filing or as
disclosed in the TLC Disclosure Letter, neither TLC nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in violation of, or has violated, any applicable provisions of any Laws,
other than violations which would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a TLC Material Adverse Effect. Except as
described or provided for in any TLC SEC Filing or as disclosed in the TLC
Disclosure Letter, TLC and its Subsidiaries have obtained and maintain in effect
all Licenses required by any Governmental Authority to properly and legally
operate or conduct the business in which TLC and its Subsidiaries are engaged,
other than those Licenses the absence of which would not have or reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a TLC Material Adverse
Effect. Except as described or provided for in any TLC SEC Filing or as
disclosed in the TLC Disclosure Letter, TLC is not in default or in violation of
the terms of any of the Licenses and none of the Licenses are subject to pending
revocation or cancellation, other than with respect to Licenses, the loss of

         Social Security Act, (ii) in compliance with the conditions of
         participation in the Medicare program, except where such inability in
         the case of item (i) or non-compliance in the case of item (ii) does

         aggregate, a TLC Material Adverse Effect.

         5.28.2. Except as disclosed in the TLC Disclosure Letter, TLC and each
         Subsidiary are not required to file cost reports and other claims and

         violation of Law, except where such violation does not have and is not
         likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a TLC Material
         Adverse Effect.

have any required certificate of need and are in substantial compliance with the
conditions of participation of such programs and certificate, except where the
failure to be so certified, to have such agreements, or to be in such compliance

returns, cost reports and other filings made by TLC or any Subsidiary with
Medicare, Medicaid or any other governmental health care program or third party
payor are complete and accurate except where the failure to be so complete and
accurate is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
TLC Material Adverse Effect. No adjustment or disallowance in any such costs
reports and other requests for payment, including adjustments or disallowances
for late filings, has been made or, to the knowledge of TLC, threatened by any
federal or state agency or instrumentality or other provider reimbursement
entities relating to Medicare or Medicaid or by any third party payor which

aggregate, a TLC Material Adverse Effect.

5.30.    EXCLUSION

         To the knowledge of TLC, neither TLC nor any Subsidiary employs or
contracts with any person who has been excluded from participation in a Federal
Health Care Program (as defined in 42 U.S.C. ss. 1320a-7b(f)) where such action
could reasonably serve as a basis for TLC's or any Subsidiary's suspension or
exclusion from the Medicare or any state Medicaid program.

5.31.    FEDERAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS

         To the knowledge of TLC, neither TLC nor any Subsidiary nor any of

Security Act or any regulations promulgated thereunder; (b) has been excluded
from participation under any federal health care program (as defined in 42
U.S.A. ss. 1320a-7b(f)); or (c) has been convicted (as that term is defined in

promulgated thereunder.

5.32.    THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT

         TLC and each Subsidiary has a valid contract to participate as a
provider of services in and under those third-party payment programs in which it
operates. To the knowledge of TLC, no Action is pending to suspend, limit,
terminate, or revoke the status of TLC or any Subsidiary as a provider in any
such program, and neither TLC nor any Subsidiary has been provided notice by any
such third-party payor of its intention to suspend, limit, terminate, revoke, or
fail to renew any contractual arrangement with TLC or any Subsidiary as a
participating provider of services in whole or in part, except where any such
Actions or notices are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a TLC Material Adverse Effect.

5.33.    BILLING; GRATUITOUS PAYMENTS

         All billing by, or on behalf of, any of TLC or any Subsidiary to
third-party payors, including, but not limited to, Medicare, Medicaid and

5.34.    REIMBURSEMENT MATTERS

         For the previous three years, neither TLC nor its Subsidiaries have

reimbursement source (inclusive of managed care organizations) with respect to
items or services provided by TLC and/or any Subsidiary, other than those which
have been finally resolved in any settlement for an amount less than $100,000.

5.35.    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

         All Accounts Receivable of TLC and its Subsidiaries reflected on the
balance sheet included in the TLC 10-K as of May 31, 2001 and all Accounts
Receivable of TLC and its Subsidiaries generated after May 31, 2001 that are

         8.4.3. Following the Effective Date of the Merger, TLC and LVCI shall
         to the extent necessary in a timely and expeditious manner make all

         necessary filings and pay such fees as are required in accordance with
         the conditional listing approval of the TSE and NASDAQ in order to
         obtain as expeditiously as possible final listing approval for the TLC

         restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any
         other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
         limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of
         administration and judicial appeal and all available legislative
         action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
         contrary, each of LVCI and TLC also agree, if requested by the other,
         to take any and all

         condition to the granting of any approvals required in order to permit
         the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
         hereby or as may be required to avoid, lift, vacate or reverse any
         legislative, administrative or judicial action which would otherwise
         cause any condition to closing not to be satisfied, unless any such
         actions individually or in the aggregate would be onerous to the
         combined operations of TLC and LVCI.

8.5.     PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS

         shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to have the

         be issued from time to time after the Effective Time upon the exercise
         of the Replacement Options, and shall use reasonable commercial efforts

         the Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such
         registration for the period of time that the Replacement Options remain
         outstanding and may be exercised.

8.8.     ACCESS TO INFORMATION

         8.8.1. Subject to Section 8.8.2 to and including Section 8.8.10 and

         manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, and shall not be used by the
         receiving party or its representatives other than in connection with
         the Merger. Moreover, the receiving party agrees to reveal the

         party's representatives.

         8.8.3. The receiving party shall keep a record of the Information

         documents prepared by the receiving party or its representatives, will
         be destroyed upon the disclosing party's request and any oral

         provide a certificate certifying as to the complete return and
         destruction of all Information in accordance with the terms of this
         paragraph.

         8.8.4. The receiving party shall keep all of the Information disclosed
         or delivered to it, whether electronically stored or in a tangible
         form, segregated from all of its property and in a safe and secure
         environment and will use commercially reasonable best efforts to
         protect and keep safe all of the Information disclosed from any loss,
         harm, theft, unauthorized use, tampering, sabotage, unauthorized
         duplication, destruction, addition, deletion, damage or interference
         whatsoever.

         8.8.5. The receiving party acknowledges that the Information is
         confidential and a valuable asset of the disclosing party and all
         right, title and interest in and to the Information (including all
         Intellectual Property) is and at all time shall remain the exclusive
         property of the disclosing party.

         8.8.6. The receiving party acknowledges that other than as contained in
         this Agreement none of the disclosing party, its representatives or any
         of its or their respective affiliates makes any express or implied
         representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the
         Information.

         8.8.7. If the receiving party or anyone to whom the receiving party
         transmits the Information pursuant to this Agreement becomes legally
         compelled to disclose any of the Information, the receiving party will
         provide the disclosing party with prompt notice so that the disclosing
         party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or
         waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If such
         protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the disclosing
         party waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, the
         receiving party will furnish only that portion of the Information which
         it is advised, by written opinion of counsel, addressed to the

         may cause significant damage and harm to a disclosing party, its
         Affiliates, Subsidiaries and shareholders and that remedies at law may
         be inadequate to protect against breach of this Agreement, and the
         parties hereby in advance agree to the granting of injunctive relief in
         favour of the disclosing party without proof of actual damages, in
         addition to any other remedy the disclosing party may be entitled to.

         regulatory approvals, (ii) preparing the Joint Proxy
         Statement/Prospectus, and (iii) avoiding conflicts.

         8.8.10. The provisions of Sections 8.8.2 to and including Section 8.8.8
         and this Section 8.8.10 shall survive the termination of this
         Agreement.

3.  Management:      Following the completion of the Merger, the senior

                     Co-General Counsels      -    General Counsel of TLC and
                                                   General Counsel of LVCI

4.  Offices:         The head office for TLC following the consummation of the
                     Merger will remain in Mississauga, Ontario, and the head
                     office for its United States operations will be located in
                     St. Louis, Missouri.

5.  Super-Majority:  In the first year following the completion of the Merger,
                     approval of any changes in the senior management listed
                     above may only be made with approval of 80% or more of the
                     TLC Board. To give effect to the foregoing, the employment
                     agreements entered into by TLC with the senior management
                     listed above shall provide, at a minimum, that in the first
                     year following completion of the Merger the agreements can
                     only be terminated with approval of 80% or more of the TLC
                     Board.
