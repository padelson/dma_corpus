_Closing_ "), the Purchaser will purchase from the Sellers, and the Sellers

number of Shares set forth next to each Sellers name on _Schedule 2.1(a)_ ,
free and clear of all Liens. (b) The aggregate consideration to be paid by the

adjusted for any additional payments under Section 2.3, the " _Purchase
Price_ "), of which US$ 332,080,139 million shall be payable at the Closing
and the Holdback Amount shall be payable pursuant to Section 2.4 below. The
Purchase Price reflects an enterprise value for the Acquired Companies of
$403 million, less the amount of the Assumed Liabilities as of the Closing

Acquired Companies by Affiliates of the Purchaser as of the Closing
($833,165), plus 50% of the other Accounts Receivable owed to the Acquired
Companies as of the Closing ($6,117,187). Each part of the Purchase Price

2.3 and Section 2.4. 

Section 2.2. _Closing_. (a) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
closing conditions set forth in _Schedule 2.2(a)_ and _Schedule 2.2(b)_ , the
Closing will take place on the date hereof, at the offices of Del Monte Fresh
Produce Company, 241 Sevilla Avenue, Coral Gables, Florida 33134. All
proceedings to be taken and all documents to be executed and delivered by all
parties at the Closing will be deemed to have been taken and executed
simultaneously, and no proceedings will be deemed to have been taken nor  



 

5  any documents executed or delivered until all have been taken, executed and
delivered. (b) At the Closing, (i) each Seller will deliver to the Purchaser
one or more certificates and, in the case of the shares of IFT, a duly
executed instrument of transfer, in each case evidencing the number of Shares
set forth next to each Sellers name on _Schedule 2.1(a)_ , in each case
duly endorsed in the name of the Purchaser, and the Sellers shall cause the
transfers of the Shares to be reflected in the stock registry or register of
members (as applicable) of each Acquired Company; and (ii) concurrently the
Purchaser will wire transfer to the Sellers account indicated on _Schedule
2.1(a)_ an aggregate amount, in immediately available U.S. Dollar funds, equal
to the Purchase Price less the Holdback Amount.

Section 2.3. _Post-Closing Transactions_. (a) The Purchaser will use its best
efforts to apply or cause the Acquired Companies to repay the outstanding
amount of the Assumed Liabilities (other than leases), as soon as practicable
and in no event later than 60 days after the date of the Closing. (b) Within
10 days after September 8, 2008, the Purchaser will cause to be paid to the
Sellers, if positive, (i) the aggregate amount of Scheduled Receivables
collected from third parties from the Closing until September 8, 2008, less
(ii) US$ 6,117,187 less (iii) any amounts corresponding to claims for Losses
for breach of the representation in Section 3.6(a) as to which the Purchaser
has provided notice to the Sellers pursuant to Article VI. (c) Within 10 days
after December 31, 2008, the Purchaser will cause to be paid to the Sellers,
if positive, (i) the aggregate amount of Scheduled Receivables collected from
the Closing to December 31, 2008, less (ii) US$6,117,187 less (iii) any net
amount paid to the Sellers pursuant to Section 2.3(b) for the period through
September 8, 2008, less (iv) any amounts corresponding to claims for Losses
for breach of the representation in Section 3.6(a) as to which the Purchaser
has provided notice to the Sellers pursuant to Article VI prior to December
31, 2008. (d) For the avoidance of doubt, _Schedule 2.3_ includes examples of
the calculation of the foregoing payments. (e) In the event that as of
December 31, 2008 the amount of Liabilities of the Acquired Companies as of
the Closing proves to be less than the amount of Assumed Liabilities set forth
on Schedule 3.6(a), then promptly following such date the Purchaser shall
cause the amount by which the Assumed Liabilities were overstated, less
the amount of any pending claim for Losses of which the Purchaser has
notified the Sellers pursuant to Article VI that have not otherwise been
withheld pursuant to this Section 2.3, to be refunded to the Sellers. (f) All
payments made pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be accompanied by a schedule
evidencing in reasonable detail the calculation of the payment consistent with
Schedule 2.3.

Section 2.4. _Holdback Amount_. (a) The Purchaser will pay a portion of the
Purchase Price equal to US$2 million (the " _Holdback Amount_ ") in the
following manner: US$1 million on June 5, 2009 (the " _First Payment Date_ ")
and US$1 million on June 7, 2010 (the " _Second Payment Date_ "), _provided_
that the Purchaser may deduct from the Holdback Amount any amounts
corresponding to claims for Losses as to which the Purchaser has provided
notice to the Sellers pursuant to Article VI. (b) If the Purchaser has
provided notice to the Sellers Representative of any Losses pursuant to
Article VI, and any such claim is pending on the First Payment Date and the
Second Payment Date, then the Purchaser will instead pay on each of such
payment dates an amount equal to US$1 million minus the total amount of Losses
sought by the Purchaser in connection with such claims of which the Sellers
 



 

6  Representative was notified during the year preceding such payment date. (c)
In the event that any claim for Losses is resolved in favor of the
Sellers after the amount of claimed Losses has been deducted as set forth in
this Section 2.4(b), then the Purchaser will pay to the Sellers
Representative any amounts withheld in connection with such claim to the
Sellers Representative as soon as practicable after the date of such
resolution. All amounts payable to the Seller in respect of the Holdback
Amount shall be accompanied by accrued interest at an annual rate of 4.0%.

Section 2.5. _Board of Directors; Powers of Attorney_. (a) Concurrently with
the Closing, the Sellers will take, and will cause each Acquired Company to
take, all actions necessary to cause the Acquired Companies to convene such
meetings of the shareholders or the board of directors as applicable of each
Acquired Company as are necessary for the purposes of authorizing
and approving corporate resolutions to: (i) elect to the boards of directors
of the Acquired Companies such Persons as the Purchaser may designate prior to
the convening of such meeting and granting such Persons powers of attorney,
(ii) revoke any and all powers of attorney of the Acquired Companies, except
as the Purchaser may otherwise specify, and designate the Persons authorized
to operate the bank accounts of the Acquired Companies, and (iii) where
applicable, appoint any notary publics as the Purchaser may designate to
notarize and register the minutes containing the foregoing resolutions. (b)
The Sellers will execute the aforementioned resolutions and register evidence
of such actions in each Acquired Companys minute book concurrently with
receipt of the Purchase Price by the Sellers in accordance with Section 2.1.

jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation and has all requisite
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
(b) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each
Seller and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of each Seller, enforceable against each Seller in
accordance with its terms, except (i) as limited by laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors, and
(ii) as limited by laws governing specific performance, injunctive relief or

of this Agreement by the Sellers do not and will not: (i) conflict with any
provision of any applicable law; (ii) conflict with the certificate of

7  of association or articles of association (as applicable) of an Acquired
Company or Seller; (iii) conflict with (or give any Person the right to

any of the transactions contemplated hereby or to obtain any relief under any
law to which an Acquired Company or Seller, or any of their assets, may be
subject; or (v) result in the imposition or creation of any Lien with respect

jurisdiction in which it operates, in which the character of the properties

_Straddle Period_ "), the portion of each Tax that is allocable to the pre-
Closing portion of a Straddle Period will be (i) in the case of a Tax that is
based on net or gross income, sales, receipts or other similar events, the Tax
that would be due based on the interim closing of the books, had such pre-

and (ii) in the case of a Tax that is not included in (i) above (e.g.,

harmless, protect and defend the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Acquired Companies), and their respective directors,
officers, agents and employees, successors and assigns from and against:

(i) any and all Losses incurred by any of them arising out of, relating to or
based upon any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the representations or
warranties of the Sellers contained in this Agreement or in the Schedules or
Exhibits hereto;

based upon any failure to perform, or other breach of, any of the covenants
or agreements of either of the Sellers contained in or incorporated into this
Agreement or in the Schedules hereto;

(iii) any and all Taxes imposed on any Acquired Company (a) for any period

hereunder will not be limited or affected by any investigation conducted, or
notice or knowledge obtained, by or on behalf of any such Persons prior to the
date of the Closing.

(b) No indemnification under this Section 6.2 shall be due unless the
aggregate amount of Losses (aggregating all indemnifiable matters under this
Section 6.2) due exceeds US$10,000, in which case indemnity shall become due
for any Losses in excess of such amount.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers will not be required to
indemnify the Purchaser pursuant to this Article VI for any Losses (i) to the
extent the Purchaser actually receives proceeds from insurance to pay such
Losses, and (ii) to the extent the Purchaser actually receives payment from a
Person on account of such Losses including but not limited to a third party
also required to indemnify the Purchaser, in each case net of reasonable costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the collection of such amounts. The
Purchaser will refund any amount it actually receives (net of costs and
expenses incurred in connection with collection of such amount) pursuant to
the preceding sentence from insurance or a third party to the extent it
actually receives such amount after payment by the Sellers.

Section 6.3. _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. From and after the date
hereof, the Purchaser agrees to indemnify fully, hold harmless, protect and
defend the Sellers and their Affiliates (and their respective directors,
officers, agents and employees, successors and assigns) from and against any
and all Losses incurred by any of them arising out of, relating to, based upon
or as a result of (a) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the
representations or warranties of the Purchaser and (b) any failure to perform,
or other breach of, any of the covenants or agreements of the Purchaser, in
either case contained in this Agreement or in the Schedules or Exhibits
hereto. The right of the Sellers and their Affiliates (and their respective
directors, officers, agents and employees, successors and assigns) to be
indemnified hereunder will not be limited or affected by any investigation
conducted or notice or knowledge obtained by or on behalf of any such Persons.

Section 6.4. _Procedure for Indemnification for Third Party Claims_. (a)
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 6.2 or Section
6.3 of notice of the commencement of any proceeding against it or any Acquired
Company, such indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an
indemnifying party under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying party
of the commencement of such claim.



 

17 (b) If any proceeding referred to in Section 6.4(a) is brought against an
indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of the
commencement of such proceeding, the indemnifying party will be entitled to
participate in such proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i)
the indemnifying party is also a party to such proceeding and the indemnified
party determines in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to provide reasonable
assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity to defend such
proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such proceeding), to
assume the defense of such proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to
the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such
proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as long as it diligently conducts
such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under this Article VI for any
reasonable fees of other counsel or any other reasonable expenses with
respect to the defense of such proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred
by the indemnified party in connection with the defense of such proceeding,
other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a proceeding, (i) it will be conclusively established
for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that proceeding are
within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no compromise or
settlement of such claims may be effected by the indemnifying party without
the indemnified partys consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law
or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims
that may be made against the indemnified party, and (B) the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying party;
and (iii) the indemnified party will have no Liability with respect to any
compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its consent. For the
avoidance of doubt, no settlement or other disposition of any claim for Tax
which would adversely affect the Acquired Companies or the Purchaser in any
taxable period ending after the Closing in any manner or to any extent will be
agreed to without the Purchasers prior written consent. If notice is given to
an indemnifying party of the commencement of any proceeding and the
indemnifying party does not, within 10 days after the indemnified partys
notice is given, give notice to the indemnified party of its election to
assume the defense of such proceeding, the indemnifying party will be bound
by any determination made in such proceeding or any compromise or settlement
effected by the indemnified party.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a proceeding may adversely
affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for
which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the
indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the
exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such proceeding at its sole
cost and expense, but the indemnifying party will not be bound by any
determination of a proceeding so defended or any compromise or settlement
effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).



 

18 Section 6.5. _Character of Indemnity Payments_. The parties will treat all
amounts paid pursuant to Article VI as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

Section 6.6. _Exclusive Remedies_. The Purchaser and the Sellers acknowledge
and agree that the foregoing indemnification provisions in this Article VII
and the remedies set forth in Article II with respect to the Holdback Amount
and the Scheduled Receivables shall be the exclusive remedies of the Purchaser
and the Sellers with respect to the Acquired Companies and the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 7.1. _Non-competition_. (a) The Sellers agree, jointly and severally,
that they will not (and will cause each of their respective Affiliates not
to), prior to the 10th anniversary of the Closing, without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, directly or indirectly: (i) engage in, or conduct
any Restricted Activity or provide consulting services in connection with a
Restricted Activity to any Person engaged in or conducting any Restricted
Activity; (ii) have any beneficial interest in any Person that engages in any
Restricted Activity (it being understood that, for purposes of this clause
(ii), "beneficial interest" means having any interest in a Person that engages
in Restricted Activities, for example as an employee, director, agent,
creditor, consultant, security holder owning more than 5% of any class of
equity securities, of such Person), (iii) participate in any way in any entity
or organization of any kind, whether currently existing or subsequently
formed, engaged in any Restricted Activity, including serving as a member or
director of Corbana, Camara Nacional de Bananeros, Anaproban, Camara de
Productores Independientes de Banano, and Canapep (Camara Nacional de
Productores y Exportadores de Piña), _provided_ that the Restricted Persons,
may serve on the foregoing or similar organizations to the extent required in
their capacity as an ambassador or cabinet level or higher government
position or as an elected or appointed national government official; (iv)
Except for the persons listed on _Schedule 7.1_ , induce, encourage or solicit
any technical staff, manager, or supervisor with an annual salary in excess
of US$20,000 to leave his or her employment with an Acquired Company or
subsidiary thereof, accept any other employment, enter into any independent
contractor relationship or assist any other Person in hiring such employee, it
being understood that such restriction does not apply to any employee whom an
Acquired Company shall terminate or who has voluntarily resigned his or her
employment with an Acquired Company; or (v) induce, encourage or solicit any
Person who is a client, customer or supplier of an Acquired Company (or their
successors) to terminate, reduce or decline to enter into any Contract or
other arrangement with an Acquired Company.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following actions by SIELSA will not be
deemed to be a violation of this Section 7.1: (i) the performance by SIELSA
until December 31, 2008 of its obligations under any SIELSA Contract that has
not been assigned to the Purchaser, despite the Sellers compliance with their
obligation in Section 7.3 to use best efforts to assign each SIELSA Contract
to the Purchaser, and (ii) other actions taken by SIELSA at the written
request of Purchaser or its Affiliates.



 

19 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, (x) the obligations of the
Seller to cause Affiliates who are natural Persons to comply with these
restrictions shall be satisfied if the Sellers use their best efforts to cause
such natural Persons to comply with these restrictions, and (y) neither the
Sellers, the Restricted Persons nor any of their Affiliates shall be
restricted from having an ownership interest in, or being an officer, director
or executive of, a bank or similar financial institution that in the ordinary
course of business extends financing to Persons that engage in a Restricted
Activity.

(d) The obligations of the Sellers under this Section 7.1 are in addition to
any obligations the Sellers may have under any other Contract. The Sellers
and the Purchaser agree that the remedy at law for any breach of the foregoing
will be inadequate and that the Purchaser, in addition to any other relief
available to it, will be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief without the necessity of proving actual damages.

(e) In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitral
tribunal enters preliminary injunctive relief with respect to a dispute
concerning this Section 7.1 against any Seller with which relief such Seller
does not immediately comply with such order, then the parties acknowledge
that it would be difficult to establish the amount of actual damages to the
Purchaser as a result of such non-compliance and the Sellers, jointly and
severally, therefore agree to pay liquidated damages to the Purchaser in an
amount equal to US$50,000 per each day of non-compliance with such order from
the date such order is issued.

(f) With respect to any judicial proceeding, the Sellers agree, jointly and
severally, that (i) if a court or arbitrator will refuse to enforce any of
these separate covenants, such unenforceable covenants will be deemed
eliminated from the provisions hereof for the purposes of such proceeding to
the extent necessary for the remaining separate covenants to be enforced in
such proceeding, and (ii) if a court or arbitrator will refuse to enforce one
or more of the separate covenants because the total time thereof is deemed to
be excessive or unreasonable, then such covenants which would otherwise be
unenforceable due to such excessive or unreasonable period of time will be
enforced for such lesser period of time as will be deemed reasonable and not
excessive by such court or arbitrator.

(g) The Sellers acknowledge that without the covenants not to compete
contained in this Section 7.1 and the agreement by each Restricted Person to
enter into a Non-Compete Agreement in the form of _Exhibit A_ , the Purchaser
would not enter into this Agreement or otherwise purchase the Shares and that
such covenants are material and necessary inducement to the Purchaser
entering into this transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a court of
competent jurisdiction declares the non compete covenant or the related non
compete agreements of the Restricted Persons unenforceable, such
a determination shall not invalidate this Agreement. The Purchaser and the
Sellers agree that in connection with the reporting, filing and payment of any
federal or state taxes they will not allocate any portion of the Purchase
Price to the non-compete covenants contained in this Section 7.1.



 

20 Section 7.2. _Certain Real Property_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies will have access to the real
property set forth in _Schedule 3.14(b)_ until July 6, 2008 or December 31,
2008, as applicable, and on such other terms and conditions contained in the
Services Agreement with respect to such property, the form of which is set
forth in _Exhibit B_.

Section 7.3. _Assignment of SIELSA Contracts_. The Sellers agree to use their
best efforts to cause SIELSA to obtain as soon as practicable any necessary
consent to unconditionally assign its rights and obligations under each SIELSA
Contract identified in _Schedule 7.3_ to the Purchaser (or its designee). The
Purchaser agrees to accept any of the SIELSA Contracts that has been duly
assigned to it or its designee within 30 days of the date of this Agreement.
In the event that (i) one or more of the SIELSA Contracts providing for
the purchase of bananas from growers is not so assigned and as a result
SIELSA has an excess supply of bananas, then the Purchaser agrees to cause the
Acquired Companies to purchase such excess bananas on terms consistent with
past practice or (ii) one or more of the SIELSA Contracts providing for the
sale by SIELSA of bananas is not so assigned and as a result SIELSA has a
shortfall of bananas, then the Purchaser agrees to cause the Acquired
Companies to supply SIELSAs requirements of bananas on terms consistent with
past practice to allow SIELSA to cover such shortfall; _provided_ that in each
case the obligations of the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies to purchase
or supply bananas to SIELSA under this Section 7.3 will expire on December
31, 2008.

Section 7.4. _Post-Closing Cooperation_. Until December 31, 2008, the Sellers
shall provide, and cause their Affiliates to provide, the Purchaser or its
Affiliates such information, cooperation and support reasonably requested by
one or more of them to assist and facilitate (a) the transition of the
Business, its operations and activities to the management and administration
of the Purchaser and its applicable Affiliates, (b) the termination of
employees of the Acquired Companies, the rehiring of such employees as the
Purchaser desires to rehire, and the obtaining of _finiquito_ or settlement
agreements from each such employee, (c) the repayment of the Assumed
Liabilities and the cancellation of any outstanding debt instrument, including
Mortgage Bonds, and (d) the accurate recording and registration of all real
property of the Acquired Companies that is currently subject to any Lien or
interest of Aramo Trust Co. Ltd. or Corporacion Gacelex, S. A.

Section 7.5. _Scheduled Receivables_. The Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect Scheduled Receivables following the date of
this Agreement.

Section 7.6. _Nondisclosure and Exclusivity Agreement_. The Nondisclosure and
Exclusivity Agreement will terminate as of the Closing.



 

21 Section 7.7. _Public Announcements_. The parties will not issue any press
release or otherwise make any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of the other party, except as required by applicable law or stock
exchange or similar requirements.

22 Section 8.2. _Sellers  Representative_. (a) The Sellers hereby irrevocably
appoint JAS Investments Corp. (the " _Sellers  Representative_") as the
Sellers agent and duly appointed attorney-in-fact to take any action required
or permitted to be taken by the Sellers under this Agreement. The Sellers
agree to be bound by all actions taken by the Sellers Representative on the
Sellers behalf in connection with this Agreement.

(b) The Purchaser will be entitled to rely exclusively upon any
communications or writings given or executed by the Sellers Representative
and will not be liable in any manner whatsoever for any action taken or not
taken in reasonable reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or
communications or writings given or executed by the Sellers Representative.

Section 8.3.  _Successors, Assigns and Transferees_. (a) The rights and
obligations under this Agreement may be transferred only with the written
consent of the other parties. Any transfer in violation of this Section 8.3(a)
will be null and void. (b) This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure

indemnified parties with respect to Article VI.

Section 8.4. _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA WITHOUT REGARD TO
CONFLICT OF LAWS.

Section 8.5. _Jurisdiction_. (a) The parties hereto agree that any dispute,
controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this
Agreement, including any dispute regarding its validity or termination, or the
performance or breach thereof, shall be finally settled by arbitration
administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the International
Chamber of Commerce (the " _ICC_ "). The arbitration shall be conducted in
accordance with the ICC Rules of Arbitration in effect at the time of the
arbitration, except as they may be modified herein or by agreement of the
parties. The place of arbitration shall be Miami, Florida and the proceedings
shall be conducted in the English language.

(b) The arbitration shall be conducted by three arbitrators (the " _Tribunal_
"). The Purchaser shall nominate one arbitrator, and the Seller named a party
to the arbitration (or, if more than one Seller is named a party, the Sellers
jointly) shall nominate one arbitrator, in each case within 30 days after
delivery of the Request for Arbitration. In the event a party fails
to nominate an arbitrator within the time set forth herein, upon request of
either party, such arbitrator shall instead be appointed by the ICC within 30
days of receiving such request. The two arbitrators appointed in accordance
with the above provisions shall nominate the third arbitrator within 30 days
of their appointment. If the first two appointed arbitrators fail to nominate
a third arbitrator within the time set forth herein, then, upon request of
either party, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICC within 30
days of receiving such request. The third arbitrator shall serve as chairman
of the Tribunal.



 

23 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
arbitration provisions set forth herein, and any arbitration conducted
thereunder, shall be governed exclusively by the Federal Arbitration Act,
Title 9 United States Code, to the exclusion of any state or municipal law of
arbitration.

(d) Any award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the
parties, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

(e) By agreeing to the arbitration, the parties do not intend to deprive a
court of competent jurisdiction of its ability to issue, either before or
after the Tribunal has been constituted, any form of provisional remedy with
respect to the obligations set forth in Section 7.1 of this Agreement,
including but not limited to a preliminary injunction or attachment in aid of
the arbitration, or order any interim or conservatory measure. A request for
such provisional remedy or interim or conservatory measure by a party to a
court shall not be deemed a waiver of this agreement to arbitrate. Each Seller
agrees to submit to the non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state and
federal courts sitting in Miami, Florida for the purposes of any court
proceeding seeking provisional remedies or interim or conservatory measures
for any threatened or actual breach of Section 7.1 of this Agreement.

(f) If a court of competent jurisdiction issues any provisional remedy or any
interim or conservatory measure in respect of a dispute concerning Section
7.1 of this Agreement, the parties agree that promptly after such decision is
rendered, the Tribunal shall render an award, issuing the same provisional
remedy or interim or conservatory measure as ordered by the court. Judgment
on such an award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(g) If the party seeking provisional remedies or interim or conservatory
measures for any threatened or actual breach of Section 7.1 of this Agreement
prevails before a court or arbitral tribunal, it shall be entitled to recover
its costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred in
connection with any court or arbitral proceeding seeking such provisional
remedies or interim or conservatory measures.

(h) The parties agree to submit to the (A) exclusive personal jurisdiction of
the state and federal courts sitting in Miami, Florida for the purposes of
(i) enforcing this agreement to arbitrate, and (ii) any court proceeding
seeking provisional remedies or interim or conservatory measures for any
threatened or actual breach of any provision of this Agreement other
than Section 7.1 of this Agreement; (B) non-exclusive personal jurisdiction
of the state and federal courts sitting in Miami, Florida for the purposes of
obtaining judgment upon any award rendered by the Tribunal.

(i) The parties waive and agree not to assert any objection that they may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any proceeding to which they
have consented to jurisdiction in the state and federal courts sitting in
Miami, Florida, nor to claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.



 

24 (j) Process in any action or proceeding referred to in this Section 8.4 may be
served on any party anywhere in the world.

Section 8.6. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, each party will be solely responsible for its respective costs and
expenses, including but not limited to any fees and expenses of counsel or any
financial advisor, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 8.7. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement
will be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions will not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby as long as the remaining provisions do not fundamentally
alter the relations among the parties.

Section 8.8. _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. (a) This Agreement sets forth the
entire understanding and agreement between the parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersedes and replaces any prior
understanding, agreement or statement of intent, in each case written or oral,
of any kind and every nature with respect hereto. Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended, modified or waived in whole or in part at any time
by an agreement in writing between the parties executed in the same manner as
this Agreement. (b) The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement will not operate or be construed as a further or
continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no failure on the part
of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or
remedy hereunder, or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in
equity, will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

Section 8.9. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts each of which when so executed will be deemed to be an
original and all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 8.10. _Currency Indemnity_. U.S. Dollars is the sole currency of
account and payment for all sums payable under or in connection with this
Agreement. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than U.S.
Dollars by any Person in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it will
only constitute a discharge to the extent of the U.S.-dollar amount which the
recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in
that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it
is practicable to do so). If that U.S.-dollar amount is less than the
U.S.-dollar amount expressed to be due to the recipient under this Agreement,
the Person making such payment will indemnify such recipient against the cost
of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this Section 8.10, it will
be sufficient for the recipient to certify (indicating the sources of
information used) that it would have suffered a loss had an actual purchase of
U.S.  



 

25  Dollars been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the
date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of U.S. Dollars on such date
had not been practicable, or the first date on which it would have been
practicable). These indemnities constitute a separate and independent
obligation from any other obligations under this Agreement, will give rise to
a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
waiver granted by any Person and will continue in full force and effect
despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in
respect of any sum due under this Agreement or any other judgment or order.



 

26 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each party has caused this Agreement to be executed in
Miami, Florida on its behalf by its representatives thereunto duly
authorized, all as of the day and year first above written.
