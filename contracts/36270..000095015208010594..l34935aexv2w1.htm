   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 The Merger 

   

 1.1 _The Merger_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), the Company shall merge with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the Company shall thereupon cease. Merger Sub shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and shall continue to be governed by the laws of Maryland. 

  

 (b) The Merger shall have the effects specified in this Plan and the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "). 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as then in effect, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, except with respect to the name of the Surviving Corporation, and the By-Laws of Merger Sub, as then in effect, shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be the name of the Company. 

  

 1.2 _Effective Time_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, on or before the Closing Date, the parties will execute and Parent will cause articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be filed with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (the " _Maryland Department_ ") as provided in Section 3-107 of the MGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger has been filed, or at such other time as may be specified therein. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ". 

  

 (b) Parent and the Company will each cause the Effective Time to occur not later than the fifth business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions specified in Sections 6.1(a), (b) and (d) of this Plan, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions set forth in Article VI. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.2(b), Parent and the Company may cause the Effective Time to occur on such earlier or later day following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions as they may agree, consistent with the provisions of the MGCL. 

  

 1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at such time and place as Parent and the Company shall agree, on the date when the Effective Time is to occur (the " _Closing Date_ "). 

  

 1.4 _Bank Merger_. As soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Plan, Provident Bank of Maryland shall enter into an agreement with a Parent bank subsidiary to be specified by Parent, pursuant to which Provident Bank of Maryland will merge with and into such Parent bank subsidiary (the " _Bank_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _Merger_ "). The parties intend that the Bank Merger will become effective
immediately following the Effective Time. 

  

 1.5 _Parent Board_. Parent agrees to cause one current member of the board of directors of the Company designated by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Parent to be appointed to the board of directors of Parent immediately after the Effective Time. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 Conversion or Cancellation of Shares 

   

 2.1 _Conversion or Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any stockholder: 

  

 (a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception Shares (as hereinafter defined), shall be converted into the right to receive, but subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.1 and possible adjustment as set forth in Section 2.4, 0.171625 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). 

  

 (b) _Company Preferred Stock._  

  

 (1) Each share of Company Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, but subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.1, one share of a series of Parent Preferred Stock (the " _Series A Preferred Consideration_") to be designated, prior to the Closing Date, as Mandatory Convertible Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock and having powers, preferences and rights such that the holders of the Company Series A Preferred Stock are not adversely affected by such conversion. 

   

 (2) Each share of Company Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, but subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.1, one share of Parent Preferred Stock (the " _Series B Preferred Consideration_" and, together with the Exchange Ratio and the Series A Preferred Consideration, the " _Consideration_ ") to be designated, prior to the Closing Date, as Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and having rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers such that the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Company Series B Preferred Stock are not adversely affected by such conversion and having rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions of the Company Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to such conversion, taken as a whole. 

   

 (c) _Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Cancellation of Old Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception Shares, each share of Company Series A Preferred Stock and each share of Company Series B Preferred Stock is hereinafter defined as an " _Old Share_ ". At the Effective Time, Old Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (an " _Old Certificate_ ") formerly representing Old Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except the right to receive, without interest, upon exchange of such Old Certificate in accordance with Section 2.3, the Consideration applicable to such Old Shares. 

  

 (e) _Exception Shares_. At the Effective Time, (1) each Exception Share owned by Parent or the Company or their respective subsidiaries shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, and (2) each Exception Share held by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the Exchange Ratio. " _Exception Share_ " means a share of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock owned or held, other than in a bona fide fiduciary or agency capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted in good faith, by Parent, the Company or a subsidiary of either. 

  

 2.2 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article II, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued pursuant to the Merger. Instead, Parent will pay or cause to be paid to the holder of any Old Shares that would, pursuant to paragraph 2.1, otherwise be entitled to receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the Measurement Price. As used in this Plan, the term " _Measurement Price_ " means the average of the daily high and low per share sales prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), as reported in the New York City edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, for the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 2.3 _Exchange of Old Certificates for New Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent._ At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") (which entity shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as exchange agent hereunder and make available or cause to be made available to the Exchange Agent certificates or, at Parents option, evidence of shares in book entry form (each, a " _New Certificate_ "), representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange for Company Common Stock, the shares of Parent Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(b) in exchange for Company Series A Preferred Stock and the shares of Parent Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in exchange for Company Series B Preferred Stock (each, a " _New Share_ ") and cash in amounts sufficient to allow the Exchange Agent to make all deliveries of New Certificates and payments that may be required 

   ##### 

  

    

in exchange for Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II (collectively,
the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company as of the first anniversary of
the Effective Time may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be paid to
Parent. In such event, any holder of Old Certificates who has not theretofore
exchanged his or her Old Certificates for New Certificates and/or cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to this Article II shall thereafter be
entitled to look exclusively to Parent, and only as a general creditor
thereof in the case of cash in lieu of fractional shares, for the shares of
Parent Common Stock and/or Parent Preferred Stock and/or cash in lieu of
fractional shares to which he or she may be entitled upon exchange of such
Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent
nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of Old Certificates for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of an Old Certificate, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in exchange for the consideration to which such Person may be entitled pursuant to this Article II. Each holder of record of an Old Certificate that has surrendered its Old Certificates will be entitled to receive a New Certificate representing the shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be, issuable in exchange therefor and/or a check representing cash payable pursuant to this Article II. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any New Certificates or cash to be delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates. If any New Certificate is to be issued or cash is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition to the exchange that the Person requesting the exchange (1) pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of the New Certificate or the making of the cash payment in a name other than the name of the holder of the surrendered Old Certificate or (2) establish to the satisfaction of Parent (or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be) that any such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock having a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to any holder of record of Company Common Stock until such holder has surrendered the Old Certificate representing such stock as provided herein. Subject to the effect of applicable law, following surrender of any such Old Certificates, there shall be paid to the holder of New Certificates issued in exchange therefor, without interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously payable with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby. To the extent permitted by law, holders of Company Common Stock who receive Parent Common Stock in the Merger shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent stockholders the number of whole shares of Parent Common 

    ##### 

 

  

Stock into which their respective shares of Company Common Stock are
converted, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their Old
Certificates for New Certificates in accordance with the provisions of this
Plan, but beginning 30 days after the Effective Time no such holder shall
be entitled to vote on any matter until such holder surrenders such Old
Certificate for exchange as provided in Section 2.3(b). For the avoidance of
doubt, until such time as the relevant Old Certificates are exchanged for New
Certificates, dividends or other distributions payable with respect to the
Parent Preferred Stock exchangeable for Company Preferred Stock hereunder will
be paid after the Effective Time to any holder of record of the Company
Preferred Stock, such holder shall be entitled to vote after the Effective
Time at any meeting of holders of Parent Preferred Stock of the applicable
series, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their
Old Certificates for New Certificates in accordance with the provisions of
this Plan. 

   

 (d) _Transfers_. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Old Shares. 

  

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate, issue or cause to be issued a New Certificate and pay or cause to be paid the amounts, if any, deliverable in respect to the Old Shares formerly represented by such Old Certificate pursuant to this Article II. 

  

 2.4 _Adjustment of Exchange Ratio_. If Parent changes (or the board of directors of Parent sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change. 

  

 2.5 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Plan such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Plan as having been paid to the Person in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made.

this Plan and the other matters required to be approved or adopted in order
to carry out the intentions of this Plan (a " _Change in Recommendation_ ")

to take such action would breach its fiduciary obligations under applicable
law, _provided_ that the board of directors of the Company may not take any
such action with respect to an Acquisition Proposal except in compliance with

misleading and (b) the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement

necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly
inform the other party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement.

document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities or banking laws, and (2) all other information concerning the

permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, would
result in disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of
its obligations with respect to confidentiality if Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, shall have used reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (B) to disclose any
privileged information of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any

that would result or would be reasonably likely to result in any Person
becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of all or
substantially all of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or total voting
power of the equity securities of the Company, that the board of directors of
the Company has determined in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to
be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making
the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction more
favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transactions contemplated by this Plan. " _Significant Subsidiary"_ has
the meaning ascribed to that term in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act"_ ). 

  

 (b) _Notice._ Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Company shall (1) promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) advise Parent, orally and in writing, of (A) the receipt by it (or any of the other Persons referred to above) of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any subsidiary by any Person or entity that informs the board of directors of the Company or any subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (B) the material terms and conditions of such proposal or inquiry (whether written or oral) or modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal, and (C) the identity of the Person making any such proposal or inquiry and (2) keep Parent fully informed of the status and details of any such proposal or inquiry and any developments with respect thereto.

 (c) _Existing Discussions._ The Company and its subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than Parent who have been furnished confidential information regarding the Company or its subsidiaries in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. Neither the Company nor the board of directors of the Company shall approve or take any action to render inapplicable to any Acquisition Proposal any applicable Takeover Laws or Takeover Provisions. 

   ##### 

  

  

 5.7 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. No party hereto shall take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Plan to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Plan from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. No party hereto shall take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Plan not to comply with any Takeover Provisions and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its control to make the transactions contemplated by this Plan comply with (or continue to comply with) the Takeover Provisions. 

  

 5.8 _Regulatory Applications_.

Each of Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Plan. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations (collectively, " _Approvals_ ") of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Plan and each party will keep the other party appraised of the status of material matters relating to such Approvals and completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all information concerning itself, its subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other party or any of its subsidiaries with or to any third party or Governmental Entity. 

  

 5.9 _Options and Restricted Stock_. 

  

 (a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding and unexercised under any employee stock option or equity compensation plan or arrangement (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") of the Company (any such option to purchase Company Common Stock being referred to as a " _Company Option_ " or the " _Company Options_ "), whether or not vested or exercisable, shall fully vest and be converted at the Effective Time into an option to purchase a 

   ##### 

  

    

number of shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Option_ ") equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (x) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share
of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) subject to the
Parent Option equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_
, _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Options shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of
the Internal Revenue Code; and _provided_ , further, that in the case of any
Company Option that is intended to be an incentive stock option under Section
422 of the Internal Revenue Code, the exercise price and the number of shares
of Parent Company Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be
determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as
are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code. Except as specifically provided above, following
the Effective Time, each Company Option shall continue to be governed by the
same terms and conditions that were applicable under such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after taking into account
any vesting as of the Effective Time to the extent provided by the original
terms of the Company Option). As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume
such Company Options and the plans under which they have been issued. 

  

 (b) _Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any vesting conditions applicable to any shares of restricted stock of the Company (each a share of " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans or other Company Benefit Plans shall be waived, and such shares of Company Restricted Stock (less any shares of Company Common Stock withheld to satisfy the tax withholding obligations upon vesting, which shares shall be considered to have been delivered to the holder of Company Restricted Stock) shall be treated the same as all other shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Article II of this Plan. 

  

 (c) _Registration_. If registration of any interests in the Company Stock Plan or other Company Benefit Plans or the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder is required under the Securities Act, Parent shall file with the SEC within three (3) business days after the Effective Time a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to such interests or Parent Common Stock, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as the relevant Company Stock Plan or other Company Benefit Plans, as applicable, remains in effect and such registration of interests therein or the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder (and compliance with any such state laws) continues to be required. 

  

 (d) _Actions._ Company agrees that prior to the Effective Time each of the Company Stock Plans shall be amended (i) to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the conversion of the Company Options pursuant to Section 5.9(a) of this Agreement and the substitution of Parent for the Company thereunder to the extent appropriate to effectuate the assumption of such 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Stock Plans by Parent, (ii) to preclude any automatic or formulaic
grant of options, restricted shares or other awards thereunder on or after
the Effective Time, and (iii) to the extent requested by Parent in a timely
manner and subject to compliance with applicable law and the terms of the
plan, to terminate any or all Company Stock Plans effective immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than with respect to outstanding awards
thereunder). Parent shall take all actions which are necessary for the
assumption of the Company Options pursuant to this Section 5.9 including the
reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as necessary to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.9. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company, the board of directors of the Company and the
Compensation Committee of the board of directors of the Company, as
applicable, shall adopt resolutions and take all other actions necessary to
effectuate the provisions of Sections 5.9(a) and 5.9(b). 

  

 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless and advance expenses to the present and former directors and officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any such Person presently or formerly serving at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, amounts paid in settlement or other liabilities (collectively, " _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Plan), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (x) to the same extent as such Persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses pursuant to the Governing Documents and indemnification agreements, if any, in effect on the date of this Plan with the Company or any of its subsidiaries and, in the case of the directors and executive officers of the Company (y) without limitation of, and in addition to, clause (x), to the fullest extent permitted by law. In the event of any such Indemnified Liabilities, (i) Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by an Indemnified Party promptly after statements therefor are received and shall otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred and (ii) Parent and the applicable Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of such matter. If any Indemnified Party is required to bring any action to enforce rights or to collect moneys due under this Plan and is successful in obtaining a decision that it is entitled to enforcement of any right or collection of any money in such action, Parent shall reimburse such Indemnified Party for all of its expenses reasonably incurred in connection with bringing and pursuing such action including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and costs. 

  

 (b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide directors and officers liability insurance 

   ##### 

   

 

(including excess coverage) and fiduciary liability insurance in respect of
any Company Benefit Plans that serve to reimburse the present and former
officers and directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect
to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
the transactions contemplated by this Plan) which insurance shall contain at
least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by the Company, _provided_
that in no event shall Parent be required to expend annually in the aggregate
an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and _provided
further_ that if Parent is unable to maintain such policy (or such substitute
policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, Parent shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount. In lieu of the
insurance described in the preceding sentence, Parent may, at its option,
purchase prepaid or "tail" directors and officers liability insurance
coverage no less favorable than the coverage described in the preceding
sentence. 

   

 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 5.10(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation described above, shall notify Parent thereof; _provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Parent under Section 5.10(a) unless and to the extent that Parent is actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Parent hereby acknowledges notice of all matters Previously Disclosed. 

  

 (d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity, or engage in any similar transaction, then and in each case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. 

  

 (e) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

(a) Parent shall from and after the Effective Time, assume and comply with the Benefit Plans and Parent agrees to honor and perform the Companys and its subsidiaries obligations under such plans and agreements in accordance with their terms. Parent shall provide the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries with (1) compensation opportunities and pension and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the Company and its subsidiaries on the date hereof, _provided_ that for this purpose benefits under employee benefit plans of Parent applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent (excluding (x) any such plans that are frozen to new participants and (y) any grandfathered benefits provided under such plans) shall be deemed to be no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the Company and its subsidiaries on the date hereof and (2) until the first anniversary

of the Effective Time, severance benefits that are equal to the severance
benefits provided to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries under the
severance policy as disclosed in Section 5.11(a) of the Companys Disclosure
Schedule, and with respect to non-employee directors of the Company, equal to
the severance benefits under the Companys Non-Employee Directors Severance
Plan dated as of February 19, 2007. Any such severance benefits shall be
subject to the employees execution and non-revocation of Parents customary
severance agreement, and such benefits shall, in any event, be provided
pursuant to the procedures and administrative terms and conditions of the MandT
Bank Corporation Employee Severance Pay Plan. For purposes of clarity,
severance benefits shall be provided under either clause (x) or (y) and there
shall not be any combination of benefits under such plans. In addition Parent
shall (i) provide employees of the Company and its subsidiaries credit for
all years of service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries and
their predecessors prior to the Effective Time for the purpose of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals under
a defined benefit pension plan and as would result in duplication of
benefits), (ii) cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations (to the
extent such limitations did not apply to a pre-existing condition under
comparable Benefit Plans) and eligibility waiting periods under group health
plans of Parent to be waived with respect to employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries who remain as employees of Parent or its subsidiaries (and their
eligible dependents) and (iii) cause to be credited any deductibles or out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and
their beneficiaries and dependents during the portion of the calendar year
prior to their participation in Parents health plans with the objective that
there be no double counting during the year in which the Closing Date occurs
of such deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses. Parent and the Company agree to
honor, or to cause to be honored, in accordance with their terms, all vested
or accrued benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and
former employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) The Company and the Parent acknowledge that there shall be a "change in control" of the Company at the Effective Time under the Company Stock Plans and the Benefit Plans specifically identified on Section 5.11(b) of the Companys Disclosure Schedule. The board of directors and/or the compensation committee of the Company, as applicable, will take all action necessary to ensure that a "change in control" of the Company does not occur in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Effective Time under any of the Company Stock Plans and the Benefit Plans identified on Section 5.11(b) of the Companys Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (c) This Section 5.11 shall inure exclusively to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, executors and legal representatives. Without limiting the generality of Section 8.13, nothing in this Section 5.11, express or implied: (i) is intended to confer on any person other than the parties to this Plan or their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Plan; (ii) shall require the Parent to maintain any specific Benefit Plan or to guarantee employment of any employee for any period of time after the Effective Time; and (iii) shall constitute an amendment to any Benefit Plan or any Parent compensation or benefit plan or arrangement.

Each of Parent and the Company shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, covenants or agreements contained herein. 

  

 5.13 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall each take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including any such actions specified in the applicable SEC No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999. 

  

 5.14 _Assumption by Parent of Certain Obligations_. At or before the Closing, Parent shall deliver agreements or supplemental indentures as required and in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, as of the Effective Time, in order to assume expressly the due and punctual performance and observance of each and every covenant, agreement and condition (insofar as such covenant, agreement or condition is to be performed and observed by the Company) of: (a) the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of April 9, 2008 relating to certain Company Common Stock and the Company Series A Preferred Stock (the " _Company Series A Purchase Agreement_") and the Registration Rights Agreement exhibited thereto, (b) the Treasury Purchase Agreement, (c) the Warrant, and (d) the indentures, trust agreements and guarantee agreements entered into by the Company, each as more specifically identified on Section 5.14 of the Companys Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 5.15 _Formation of Merger Sub; Accession_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, and in any event within five calendar days after the date hereof, Parent shall form a Maryland corporation as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "). As of its incorporation, Merger Sub shall have its principal executive offices located in Buffalo, New York and shall have 1,000 authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 1,000 shares shall be outstanding and none of which shall be held in the treasury of Merger Sub. Promptly after incorporating Merger Sub, (x) Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, shall approve and adopt this Agreement and (y) Parent shall cause Merger Sub to accede to this Agreement by executing a signature page to this Agreement, after which time Merger Sub shall be a party hereto for all purposes set forth herein. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the obligations of Merger Sub to perform its covenants hereunder shall commence only at the time of its incorporation. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to cause the board of directors of Merger Sub to unanimously approve this Agreement and declare it advisable for Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement.

 8.7 _Entire Agreement, Etc._ This Plan (including the Disclosure Schedules) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations, both written and oral, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and this Plan shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise (any attempted assignment in contravention of this Section 8.7 being null and void). 

  

 8.8 _Definition of "subsidiary" and "affiliate"; Covenants with Respect to Subsidiaries and Affiliates_. (a) When a reference is made in this Plan to a subsidiary of a Person, the term " _subsidiary_ " has the meaning ascribed to that term in Rule 1-02 of Registration S-X under the Exchange Act. When a reference is made in this Plan to an affiliate of a Person, the term "affiliate" (or " _Affiliate_ ") means those other Persons that, directly or indirectly, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, such Person. 

  

 (b) Insofar as any provision of this Plan shall require a subsidiary or an affiliate of a party to take or omit to take any action, such provision shall be deemed a covenant by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to cause such action or omission to occur. 

  

 8.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Plan were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the parties will be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. 

  

 8.10 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in Section 7.4(b), each party will bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with this Plan and the transactions contemplated hereby, except that Parent and Company will each bear and pay one-half of the costs (excluding the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants) incurred in connection with the copying, printing and distributing of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement for the approval of the Merger. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.11 _Interpretation; Effect_. 

  

 (a) In this Plan, except as context may otherwise require, references: 

  

 (1) to the Preamble, Recitals, Sections, Annexes or Schedules are to the Preamble to, a Recital or Section of, or Annex or Schedule to, this Plan; 

   

 (2) to this Plan are to this Plan, and the Annexes and Schedules to it, taken as a whole; 

   

 (3) to the "transactions contemplated hereby" includes the transactions provided for in this Plan including the Merger; 

   

 (4) to any agreement (including this Plan), contract, statute or regulation are to the agreement, contract, statute or regulation as amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time (in the case of an agreement or contract, to the extent permitted by the terms thereof); and to any section of any statute or regulation include any successor to the section; and 

   

 (5) to any Governmental Entity includes any successor to that Governmental Entity. 

   

 (b) The words "hereby", "herein", "hereof", "hereunder" and similar terms are to be deemed to refer to this Plan as a whole and not to any specific Section. 

  

 (c) The words "include", "includes" or "including" are to be deemed followed by the words "without limitation". 

  

 (d) The word " _party_ " is to be deemed to refer to the Company or Parent. 

  

 (e) The word " _Person_ " is to be interpreted broadly to include any individual, savings association, bank, trust company, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, joint-stock company, business trust or unincorporated organization. 

  

 (f) The table of contents and article and section headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit or otherwise affect any of the substance of this Plan. 

  

 (g) This Plan is the product of negotiation by the parties, having the assistance of counsel and other advisers. The parties intend that this Plan not be construed more strictly with regard to one party than with regard to the other. 

  

 (h) The disclosure in any Section of a Disclosure Schedule shall apply only to the indicated section of this Plan except to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to another section of this Plan. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Plan shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Plan, or the application thereof to any Person or entity or any circumstance, is found by a court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Plan and the application of such provision to other Persons, entities or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

  

 8.13 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing contained in this Plan, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto, any benefit, right or remedies except that the provisions of Section 5.10 shall inure to the benefit of the Persons referred to therein. 

  

 8.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this Plan is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising out of, or relating to, this Plan, or the transactions contemplated by this Plan. Each party certifies and acknowledges that (a) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) each party understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) each party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each party has been induced to enter into this Plan by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 8.14. 

  

 8.15 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum_. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Plan or the Merger exclusively in either (1) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, the Commercial Division of the New York Supreme Court, New York County, or (2) any United States District Court or any Maryland State court sitting in Baltimore, Maryland (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and solely in connection with claims arising under this Plan or the Merger that are the subject of this Plan (a) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (b) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (c) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and (d) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 8.6 of this Plan.
