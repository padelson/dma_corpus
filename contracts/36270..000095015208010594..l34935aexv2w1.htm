<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.7 <U>Entire Agreement, Etc.</U> This Plan (including the Disclosure Schedules) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements, understandings, representations, both written and oral, between the parties, with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and this Plan shall not be assignable by operation of law or
otherwise (any&nbsp;attempted assignment in contravention of this Section&nbsp;8.7 being null and void).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.8 <U>Definition of &#147;subsidiary&#148; and &#147;affiliate&#148;; Covenants with Respect to Subsidiaries and
Affiliates</U>. (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;When a reference is made in this Plan to a subsidiary of a Person, the term
&#147;<I>subsidiary</I>&#148; has the meaning ascribed to that term in Rule&nbsp;1-02 of Registration S-X under the
Exchange Act. When a reference is made in this Plan to an affiliate of a Person, the term
&#147;affiliate&#148; (or &#147;<I>Affiliate</I>&#148;) means those other Persons that, directly or indirectly, control, are
controlled by, or are under common control with, such Person.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Insofar as any provision of this Plan shall require a subsidiary or an affiliate of a
party to take or omit to take any action, such provision shall be deemed a covenant by Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, to cause such action or omission to occur.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.9 <U>Specific Performance</U>. The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of
this Plan were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be
difficult to determine, and that the parties will be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.10 <U>Expenses</U>. Except as set forth in Section&nbsp;7.4(b), each party will bear all
expenses incurred by it in connection with this Plan and the transactions contemplated hereby,
except that Parent and Company will each bear and pay one-half of the costs (excluding the fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants) incurred in connection with the
copying, printing and distributing of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement for the
approval of the Merger.

invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Plan, or the application thereof to any
Person or entity or any circumstance, is found by a court or other Governmental Entity of competent

have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising out of, or
relating to, this Plan, or the transactions contemplated by this Plan. Each party certifies and
acknowledges that (a)&nbsp;no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
