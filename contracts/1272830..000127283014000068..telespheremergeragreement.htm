paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation, and the shares of the Surviving Corporation into
which the shares of Merger Sub common stock are so converted shall be the only
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation that are issued and

of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without

of Company Capital Stock held in the Company's treasury ("Treasury Shares") or

Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
payment of consideration therefor (such shares of Company Capital Stock,
together with any Dissenting Shares, the "Disregarded Shares").

(c) Conversion of Company Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger:

(i) each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any Disregarded Shares), shall be
cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.3, subject to the escrow
and expense fund contribution provisions set forth in Section 2.4, and
apportioned between cash and shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in
Section 2.1(d)) an amount equal to the greater of (A) the Series A Preference
Per Share Amount or (B) the As-Converted Series A Consideration Per Share (the
"Series A Per Share Amount");

(ii) each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any Disregarded
Shares), shall be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into
the right to receive (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.3, subject
to the escrow and expense fund contribution provisions set forth in Section

forth in Section 2.1(d)) an amount equal to the greater of (A) the Series B-1
Preference Per Share Amount or (B) the As-Converted Series B-1 Consideration
Per Share (the "Series B-1 Per Share Amount");

(iii) each share of Series C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any Disregarded

apportioned between cash and shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in
Section 2.1(d)) an amount equal to the greater of (A) the Series D Preference
Per Share Amount or (B) the As-Converted Series D Consideration Per Share (the

(v) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any Disregarded Shares), shall be

apportioned between cash and shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in
Section 2.1(d)) an amount equal to the Residual Per Share Amount.

(d) Payments. With respect to any Qualifying Holder, the Merger Consideration
payable to such Qualifying Holder pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall be payable
as: (i) an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) such Qualifying Holder's
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), multiplied by (B) the
Cash Percentage (such amount, a Qualifying Holder's "Cash Consideration"); and
(ii) that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of
(A)(1) such Qualifying Holder's Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.1(c), minus (2) such Qualifying Holder's Cash Consideration, divided
by (B) the Average Trading Price (such number of shares, a Qualifying Holder's
"Qualifying Holder Stock Consideration"), in each case, subject to Section
2.7(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Merger Consideration payable to the
Qualifying Holders set forth on Schedule 2.1(d), shall be allocated as set
forth therein. With respect to any Non-Qualifying Holder, such Non-Qualifying
Holder's Merger Consideration shall be payable entirely in cash (any such
portion of cash paid to a Non-Qualifying Holder in lieu of what would
otherwise be Qualifying Holder Stock Consideration, "Cash-in-Lieu"). In
determining the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to
each Qualifying Holder, all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to each
holder with respect to its shares of Company Capital Stock shall be aggregated
before determining fractional shares.

(e) Adjustments. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital
Stock occurring in compliance with the terms hereof after the Agreement Date
and prior to the Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to specified
numbers of shares (or any per share dollar amounts) of any class or series
affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon
numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices or other per share
dollar amounts therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the
extent necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change. Unless indicated otherwise, all
mathematical calculations contemplated by this Agreement shall be made to the
fifth decimal place.

2.2 Treatment of Company Options and Company Warrants.

(a) Termination of Company Options. At the Effective Time: (i) each Company
Option shall be accelerated so that it shall be fully vested and exercisable;
(ii) after giving effect to the accelerated vesting and exercisability
contemplated in clause (i) of this Section 2.2(a), each Company Option that
has not been exercised prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
cancelled and terminated and upon the cancellation thereof, each Company
Option that is not an Underwater Option shall be converted into the right to
receive, for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option, an amount in cash equal to (A) the Residual Per Share Amount, minus
(B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option (such amount, an "Option Payment" and the sum of all such
payments the "Aggregate Option Payment"), subject in all respects to (x)
adjustment pursuant to Section 2.3 and (y) the escrow and expense fund
contribution provisions set forth in Section 2.4; (iii) any and all equity
incentive plans sponsored or maintained by any Acquired Company shall be
terminated and no Person shall have any right to purchase or receive any

Underwater Options shall be entitled to any Option Payment with respect
thereto. Following the Effective Time, each holder of Company Options that are
not Underwater Options shall be entitled to receive, for each share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option, any additional amounts payable in
respect of such Company Options hereunder when, as and if paid pursuant to the
terms hereof (including pursuant to Section 2.3(f) and Article 9) and the
Escrow Agreement, and such holder shall be considered a Non-Qualifying Holder
for such purposes. All consideration to be received by the holders of
Withholding Options pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) shall be paid to and
distributed by the Surviving Corporation promptly after the Effective Time,
treated as compensation by it and shall be net of any applicable Taxes
withheld pursuant to Section 2.9. All consideration to be received by the
holders of Company Options that are not Withholding Options pursuant to this
Section 2.2(a) shall be, subject to each such holder first providing all
documentation required by Parent (including an IRS Form W-9 or any successor
form), paid to and distributed by the Exchange Agent to such Company
Optionholder. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall (1) provide notice (in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each Company Optionholder
describing the treatment of the Company Options in accordance with this
Section 2.2(a) and (2) take or cause to be taken such actions, and shall
obtain all such consents, as may be required to effect the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.2(a). The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each Company Optionholder (other than any Company
Optionholder that holds only Underwater Options) to execute and deliver an
Option Surrender Agreement to Parent.

(b) Termination of Company Warrants. At the Effective Time, each Company
Warrant that is not automatically exercised in accordance with its terms
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall terminate and be cancelled
without further action by the parties hereto or the Company Warrantholders and
without consideration in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company
Warrant, and no Company Warrantholder shall have any further rights with
respect to any Company Warrant. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall (i)
provide notice (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each Company
Warrantholder describing the treatment of the Company Warrants contemplated by
this Section 2.2(b) and (ii) take all actions that may be necessary to ensure
that each holder of a Company Warrant cancelled as provided in this Section
2.2(b) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto.

(c) Other Payments. At, or within two Business Days following, the Closing,
Parent or the Exchange Agent shall pay, or cause to be paid (including by
payment to the Company for further payment to the Persons owed such payments),
any Unpaid Transaction Fees, any unpaid Debt included in the Closing Debt
Amount with respect to which a pay-off letter is delivered at Closing, in each
case, included on the Closing Financials Certificate, on behalf of the
Company.

2.3 Adjustments.

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
prepare and deliver to Parent an estimated balance sheet of the Company as of
the Effective Time (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") and a statement of
the estimated Closing Working Capital Amount, derived from the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount"). The
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Amount shall be prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP using the same
practices, procedures, principles, classifications and methodologies applied
in the preparation of the Company Balance Sheet (including with respect to the
establishing of reserves). The Company shall provide Parent and its accounting
and financial staff, auditors and advisors reasonable access to the books and
records of the Company and its accounting and financial staff in connection
with Parent's review thereof. The Company will review any comments on the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount made by Parent and will consider, in
good faith, any appropriate changes.

(b) On the Closing Date, if the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount is
less than the Target Working Capital Amount, then the Adjusted Transaction
Value will be decreased by the amount by which the Target Working Capital
Amount is greater than the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount. If the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount is greater than the Target Working
Capital Amount, then the Adjusted Transaction Value will be increased by the
amount by which the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount is greater than
the Target Working Capital Amount. The Adjusted Transaction Value, as adjusted
pursuant to this Section 2.3(b), is referred to herein as the "Estimated
Adjusted Transaction Value."

(c) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the
Representative, as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later than
90 days following the Closing Date, a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a statement
of the Closing Working Capital Amount derived from the Closing Balance Sheet
(the "Closing Working Capital Statement"). The Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
using the same practices, procedures, principles, classifications and
methodologies applied in the preparation of the Company Balance Sheet
(including with respect to the establishing of reserves).

(d) The Representative shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Closing
Working Capital Statement (the "Objection Period") to review the Closing
Working Capital Statement. Parent shall grant the Representative access at
reasonable times and places and upon reasonable advance notice to all books,
records and employees of the Surviving Corporation as reasonably requested by
the Representative in connection with its review of the Closing Working
Capital Statement. Upon the expiration of the Objection Period, the
Representative, on behalf of all Company Stockholders and Company
Optionholders (other than Persons holding only Underwater Options), shall be
deemed to have accepted, and shall be bound by, the Closing Working Capital
Statement and the calculation therein of the Closing Working Capital Amount,
unless the Representative shall have informed Parent in writing of its
disagreement with the Closing Working Capital Statement prior to the
expiration of the Objection Period (the "Objection"), specifying each disputed
item and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for each such dispute
(each, a "Disputed Item"). Parent shall have 30 days from the date on which it
receives the Objection (the date on which such 30 day period ends, the
"Response Date") to review and respond to such Objection. If Parent and the
Representative are able to negotiate a mutually agreeable resolution of each
Disputed Item, and each signs a certificate to that effect, the Closing
Working Capital Statement and the calculation therein of the Closing Working
Capital Amount, as adjusted to reflect such resolution, shall be deemed final,
non-appealable and binding for purposes of this Agreement. If any Disputed
Items have not been resolved by the Response Date, either Parent or the
Representative may refer such Disputed Items to the Phoenix, Arizona office of
Ernst and Young LLP (such firm, or any successor thereto, the "Accounting
Referee") who shall accept its appointment within seven days after such
referral, to make a final, non-appealable and binding determination as to such
remaining Disputed Items pursuant to the terms hereof. The Accounting Referee
shall be directed to make a determination of the Disputed Items in accordance
with Section 2.3(e) promptly, but no later than 30 days, after acceptance of
its appointment. Parent and the Representative agree to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to effect the selection and appointment of the Accounting
Referee pursuant to this Section 2.3(d), including executing an engagement
agreement with the Accounting Referee providing for reasonable and customary
compensation and other terms of such engagement. Parent and the Representative
shall make readily available to the Accounting Referee all relevant books,
records and employees of the Company and the Surviving Corporation that are
reasonably requested by the Accounting Referee in connection with the
Accounting Referee's review of any Disputed Items.

(e) If Disputed Items are referred to the Accounting Referee for resolution
pursuant to Section 2.3(d), the Accounting Referee shall determine only with
respect to the Disputed Items submitted whether and to what extent, if any,
the Closing Working Capital Amount set forth in the Closing Working Capital
Statement requires adjustment. With respect to each Disputed Item, the
Accounting Referee's determination shall be within the range of values
assigned to such Disputed Item by Parent and the Representative. Any finding
by the Accounting Referee shall be (i) a reasoned award stating in reasonable
detail the findings of fact on which it is based, (ii) final, non-appealable
and binding upon the parties hereto and (iii) the sole and exclusive remedy
between the parties hereto regarding the Disputed Items so presented. The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by Parent and the
Representative (on behalf of the Company Stockholders and Company
Optionholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares) in the same
proportion that the dollar amount of Disputed Items which are not resolved in
favor of Parent or the Representative, as applicable, bears to the total
dollar amount of Disputed Items resolved by the Accounting Referee. Each of
Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the Company Stockholders and
Company Optionholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares)
shall bear the fees, costs and expenses of its own accountants and all of its
other expenses incurred in connection with matters contemplated by this
Section 2.3. Any fees, costs or expenses payable by the Representative
pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be paid out of the Expense Fund Amount.

(f) Payment of the Adjustments.

(i) Payment of the adjustments as contemplated by this Section 2.3(f) shall be
made (A) if no Objection is made by the Representative during the Objection
Period, within five Business Days following the expiration of the Objection

Period, within five Business Days following final resolution of all Disputed
Items by either Parent and the Representative or the Accounting Referee.

(ii) If, upon the final determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount as
provided in Section 2.3(d) or 2.3(e), the Closing Working Capital Amount is
greater than the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount, Parent shall
promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, an aggregate amount in cash equal
to such excess to (A) the Exchange Agent for payment to the Company
Stockholders and Company Optionholders (other than Persons holding only
Underwater Options) who are not subject to Tax withholding in accordance with
the Exchange Agent Agreement and (B) on behalf of the holders of Withholding
Options, to the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof, for subsequent

as provided in Section 2.3(d) or 2.3(e), the Estimated Closing Working Capital

(i) at the Effective Time, Parent shall withhold the Escrow Amount from the
Merger Consideration otherwise payable: (A) pursuant to Section 2.1(c) to the
Non-Dissenting Stockholders and (B) pursuant to Section 2.2(a) to the Company
Optionholders and (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Closing, Parent shall deposit in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement: (A)
an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Escrow Amount, multiplied by
(2) the Cash Percentage (the "Escrow Cash") and (B) a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1)(I) the Escrow Amount, minus
(II) the Escrow Cash, divided by (2) the Average Trading Price (the "Escrow
Shares"); provided that (x) an amount equal to the Escrow Cash-in-Lieu, shall
be deposited in cash and the number of Escrow Shares shall be reduced
accordingly and (y) the deposit of the Escrow Shares shall be subject to
Section 2.7(c). The Escrow Amount as contemplated herein shall reflect a
proportionate contribution from each Non-Dissenting Stockholder and holder of
a Company Option (other than an Underwater Option) in an amount equal to such
Person's Pro Rata Share of such amount.

(b) Escrow Agreement. Prior to the Closing, Parent, the Representative and the
Escrow Agent shall enter into an escrow agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Representative (the "Escrow
Agreement"). At or promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Cash (including any
Escrow Cash-in-Lieu) and a certificate (issued in the name of the Escrow Agent
or its nominee) representing the Escrow Shares issuable pursuant to Section
2.4(a), for the purpose of partially securing the indemnification obligations
of the Company Indemnifying Parties set forth in this Agreement. The Escrow
Cash and the Escrow Shares (collectively, the "Escrow Fund") shall be held by
the Escrow Agent as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien,
attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of
any party, and shall be held as partial security for the indemnification
obligations of the Company Indemnifying Parties under this Agreement in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
the Escrow Agreement, and the Escrow Fund shall be subject to reduction for
Claims as provided in Article 9. Each Company Indemnifying Party's rights, if
any, to receive amounts from the Escrow Fund are non-transferable and non-
assignable.

(c) Expense Fund Amount. Notwithstanding the terms of Sections 2.1(c) and
2.2(a): (i) at the Effective Time, Parent shall withhold the Expense Fund
Amount from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable: (A) pursuant to
Section 2.1(c) to the Non-Dissenting Stockholders and (B) pursuant to Section
2.2(a) to the Company Optionholders and (ii) as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Closing, Parent shall make, or cause to be made,
payment of an amount of cash by wire transfer to a segregated client bank
account maintained by the Representative, which amount shall be equal to the
amount of the Expense Fund Amount, to be held in such segregated client bank
account and distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The
Expense Fund Amount as contemplated herein shall reflect a proportionate
contribution from each Non-Dissenting Stockholder and holder of a Company
Option (other than an Underwater Option) in an amount equal to such Person's
Pro Rata Share of such amount.

(d) Tax. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Amount is intended
to be part of the aggregate acquisition consideration payable in exchange for
Company Capital Stock in accordance with this Agreement. Accordingly, except
with respect to interest imputed under Sections 483 or 1274 of the Code, the
parties agree to report payments of the Escrow Amount for U.S. federal and
state and foreign income Tax purposes consistent with such treatment unless
otherwise required by Law.

2.5 The Closing. Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant

later date and time as may be mutually agreed in writing by the Company and
Parent, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the
Articles of Merger in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B,
with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington (the "Articles of
Merger") in accordance with the applicable provisions of the WBCA (the time of
such filing and acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of
Washington, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company and specified in the Articles of Merger, shall be referred
to herein as the "Effective Time"). This Agreement shall be deemed the "plan
of merger" under Chapter 11 of the WBCA and this Agreement, excluding the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto, shall be filed with the Articles of Merger
pursuant to Section 11.050(1) of the WBCA.

2.6 Effects of the Merger. At and upon the Effective Time:

and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal, in each
case in accordance with the WBCA and the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation.

2.7 Exchange.

(a) At or promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited (i) with MUFG Union Bank, N.A. or such other Person as Parent may
select (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the Company Securityholders:
(A) an amount in cash equal to (1) the Aggregate Closing Cash Consideration
(including the Closing Cash-in-Lieu), minus (2) the portion of the Aggregate
Option Payment attributable to Company Options with respect to which the
Company has Tax withholding Obligations ("Withholding Options"), minus (3) the
Escrow Cash (including any Escrow Cash-in-Lieu) and (B) a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to (1) the Closing Shares, minus (2) the Escrow
Shares, in the form of certificates issued in the name of each Qualifying
Holder, to be held by the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of the
exchange agent agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") to be executed prior to
the Closing by Parent and the Exchange Agent; and (ii) with the Surviving
Corporation, for the benefit of the Company Optionholders who, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, hold Withholding Options that are not
Underwater Options, an amount equal to (A) the portion of the Aggregate Option
Payment attributable to such Withholding Options, minus (B) an amount equal to
the aggregate Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount and the Expense Fund Amount
attributable to such Withholding Options, which shall be distributed in
accordance with Section 2.2(a).

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Agreement Date, Parent and the
Company will develop and finalize a customary form of letter of transmittal (a
"Stockholder Letter of Transmittal") that shall contain (i) a release and
discharge of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) provisions requiring
each Company Stockholder that executes and delivers a Stockholder Letter of
Transmittal to be bound by Article 2, Article 9 and Article 11 as if such
Company Stockholder were a party hereto. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to, mail, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, to each Company Stockholder who holds a certificate or
certificates that, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
shares of Company Capital Stock (the "Certificates") a Stockholder Letter of
Transmittal. Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Closing, to any Company Stockholder who
delivers a duly completed and validly executed Stockholder Letter of
Transmittal (together with the Certificate(s) from the Company Stockholders
for cancellation or an affidavit of loss as described in Section 2.6(b) below
and any other documents as Parent shall reasonably require), the Merger
Consideration that such Company Stockholder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 2.1(c), without interest thereon.

(c) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued to Company Stockholders upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, and such former Company Stockholders shall not be entitled to
any voting rights, rights to receive any dividends or distributions or other
rights as a stockholder of Parent with respect to any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that would have otherwise been issued to such former
Company Stockholders. In lieu of any fractional shares that would have
otherwise been issued, each former Company Stockholder that would have been
entitled to receive a fractional share shall, upon proper surrender of such
Person's Certificates, receive a cash payment equal to product of (x) the
Average Trading Price, multiplied by (y) the fraction of a share that such
former Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

(d) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the Exchange Agent
shall, as promptly as practicable following the receipt by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, of such affidavit, issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
represented by the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in exchange therefor
that the Company Stockholder has the right to receive. Parent may in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide to Parent an
indemnity agreement or bond against any claim that may be made against Parent
with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, no shares of Company Capital Stock will
be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of Certificates formerly representing
such Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
except as provided herein or by Law.

(f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and no transfer of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth in the
Spreadsheet are presented to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any other amount
payable with respect to such Company Capital Stock in accordance with Section
2.1(c), subject to the terms of Section 2.3, Section 2.4 and this Section 2.7.

2.8 Dissenting Shares. If, in connection with the Merger, holders of Company
Capital Stock shall have complied with all of the requirements under Chapter
13 of the WBCA for perfecting their right to dissent from the Merger and
obtain payment of the fair value of their shares of Company Capital Stock,
none of such Dissenting Shares shall be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the holder of such Dissenting Shares
as provided in Section 2.1(c), but shall instead be converted into the right
to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the WBCA. Each holder of Dissenting Shares
who, pursuant to the provisions of the WBCA, becomes entitled to payment of
the fair value of such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance
with the WBCA (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon
or finally determined pursuant to the WBCA). In the event that any Company
Stockholder fails to make an effective demand for payment or fails to perfect
its dissenter's rights as to its shares of Company Capital Stock or any
Dissenting Shares shall otherwise lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then
any such shares shall immediately be converted into the right to receive the
consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in respect of such shares as
if such shares had never been Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall issue and
deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable
after) the applicable time or times specified in Section 2.7, following the
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 2.7, the Merger
Consideration to which such Company Stockholder would have been entitled under
Section 2.1(c) with respect to such shares. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice (and in no event more than two Business Days) of any written
notice of intent to demand payment as described in Section 13.210 of the WBCA
received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of the WBCA. The
Company agrees that, except with Parent's prior written consent, it shall not
voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demand or any assertion of dissenters'
rights by any Company Stockholder under the WBCA.

2.9 Tax Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause
to be deducted and withheld, from the Merger Consideration or any other
payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including the Escrow
Amount) or any Equity Release Agreement, the amounts required to be deducted
and withheld under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law, with respect to the making of such payment and, to the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made. Other than withholding with respect to compensation-
related payments, the Person making such withholding shall promptly notify the
Representative regarding the Person from whom funds are being withheld and the
amount of such withholding. The parties agree to cooperate to allow Parent, at
its election, to effectuate such withholding by means acceptable to Parent,
including by paying the applicable Merger Consideration for which such
withholding is required to the Surviving Corporation and causing the Surviving
Corporation to withhold the applicable amounts through the Surviving
Corporation's payroll system. Except for such withholding rights, the
recipient of any payments payable pursuant to this Agreement is solely
responsible for any and all Liabilities for Taxes that may arise with respect
to any Merger Consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement.

2.10 Further Assurances. If, at any time before or after the Effective Time,
any of the parties hereto reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary to
consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors shall
execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and
assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary to consummate the
Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

material Liability to the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole.

Option or other right to acquire Company Common Stock or other equity of any

the excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code, and no amount payable as a
result of or in connection with the consummation of the Merger to any
individual who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit
Arrangement could be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). There is no Company Benefit
Arrangement or other Contract by which any of the Acquired Companies is bound

incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course of Business and
(iii) Liabilities incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation or
execution of this Agreement that have been or will be taken into account in
the calculation of Transaction Fees. The Liabilities referred to in clauses
(ii) and (iii) of this Section 3.9 are not, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole. All reserves established
by the Company that are set forth in or reflected in the Company Balance Sheet
have been established in accordance with GAAP and are adequate. The Company
does not have any "off-balance sheet arrangement" within the meaning of Item
303 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC where the result, purpose or
effect of such Contract or arrangement would be to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material Liabilities of, any of the
Acquired Companies in the Company's and its consolidated Subsidiaries' audited
financial statements. The Acquired Companies maintain systems of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied. There are
no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting of the Acquired Companies.

3.10 Title to Properties. Each of the Acquired Companies has good and
marketable title to, or in the case of leased assets and properties, valid
leasehold interests in, all of its tangible assets and properties (including

the Company Business are reflected on the Company Balance Sheet to the extent
required under GAAP to be so reflected. Such assets are sufficient in all
material respects for the continued operation of the Company Business. All
machinery, vehicles, equipment and other tangible personal property owned or
leased by any of the Acquired Companies or used in the Company Business are in
good condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted. All leases of real
or personal property to which any of the Acquired Companies is a party are
fully effective and afford such Acquired Company, as applicable, a valid
leasehold possession of the real or personal property that is the subject of
the lease. All rents, required deposits and additional rents which are due
under the terms of the leases have been paid in full. None of the Acquired
Companies has ever owned any real property. Schedule 3.10 of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and accurate list of all real property
leases or licenses to which any of the Acquired Companies is a party and lists
the term of such lease, rent payable, security deposit, maintenance and
similar charges, and any advance rent paid thereunder.

had to pay in any event under the terms of the applicable Contracts even
without any such sublicense or extension of rights to Parent).

(e) The Owned Company IP and the Licensed IP constitute all of the
Intellectual Property Rights and Technology necessary and sufficient to enable
the Acquired Companies to conduct the Company Business. The foregoing

diluting, using or disclosing without authorization, or otherwise violating

(j) In connection with the solicitation of written consents from the Company
Stockholders, the Company shall furnish to Parent, as soon as practicable upon
the delivery and effectiveness of the written consents, a schedule that sets
forth (i) the name of each Company Stockholder who has executed and delivered
a written consent to the Company, (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock owned of record by each such Company
Stockholder, and (iii) the number of such shares with respect to which such
written consent was delivered to the Company. Such schedule shall be updated
on a regular basis by the Company as it receives additional written consents.

(k) To the extent that any "disqualified individual" with respect to the
Company or any of its Affiliates (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the
Code and the regulations thereunder) would receive any payments or benefits
that would reasonably be expected to constitute "parachute payments" (within
the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder), then, the Company will (i) no later than seven Business Days
prior to the Closing, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each
such "disqualified individual" a waiver of such disqualified individual's
rights to some or all of such payments or benefits (the "Waived 280G
Benefits") substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C so that any
remaining payments and/or benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
thereunder), and (ii) no later than four Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, with respect to each individual who agrees to the waiver described in
clause (i), submit to a vote of the Company Stockholders entitled to vote on
such matters (along with adequate disclosure intended to satisfy the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder) the right of any such "disqualified individual" to
receive the Waived 280G Benefits. The Company shall provide drafts of such
waivers and disclosure and approval materials to Parent for its review and
approval (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) no later than 10 Business Days prior to soliciting such waivers and
soliciting such approval. If any of the Waived 280G Benefits fail to be
approved as contemplated above, such Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or
provided. To the extent applicable, prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence reasonably acceptable to Parent that a vote of the
Company Stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions
of this Section 5.5 and that either (A) the requisite number of votes of
Company Stockholders was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits
(the "280G Approval") or (B) the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a
result, no Waived 280G Benefits shall be made or provided.

5.6 Necessary Consents. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain prior to the Closing such consents and authorizations of third
parties, give notices to third parties and take such other actions as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to effect the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to enable the Surviving
Corporation (or Parent) to carry on the Company Business immediately after the
Effective Time, and to keep in effect and avoid the breach, violation of,
termination of, or adverse change to, any Contract to which the Company is
party, including the consents, authorizations, notices and actions which are
listed on Schedule 5.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

5.7 Litigation. The Company shall notify Parent in writing promptly after
learning of any Action by or before any court, arbitrator or arbitration
panel, board or governmental agency, initiated by or against any of the
Acquired Companies, or known by the Company to be pending or threatened
against any of the Acquired Companies or any of their officers, directors,
employees or stockholders in their capacity as such. The Company shall notify
Parent in writing promptly after learning of any written or unwritten claim
by, or receiving any notice from, any Person (a) alleging any infringement,
misappropriation, misuse, dilution, violation, or unauthorized use or
disclosure of any Intellectual Property Rights or Technology or unfair
competition, (b) inviting any of the Acquired Companies to take a license
under any Intellectual Property Rights or consider the applicability of any
Intellectual Property Rights to any Company Offerings or the conduct of the
Company Business or (c) challenging the ownership, use, validity or
enforceability of any Company Intellectual Property Rights or Company
Technology.

5.8 No Other Negotiations.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not authorize, encourage or permit any of
its officers, directors, employees, stockholders, Affiliates, agents, advisors
(including any attorneys, financial advisors, investment bankers or
accountants) or other representatives (collectively, "Company
Representatives") to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or
knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce the making, submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any nonpublic

Acquisition Proposal (other than to respond to such Acquisition Proposal by
indicating that the Company is subject to this Section 5.8), (iii) enter into,
participate in, entertain, maintain or continue any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and its agents and advisors)
with respect to any Alternative Transaction (other than to respond to such
Acquisition Proposal by indicating that the Company is subject to this Section
5.8), (iv) otherwise cooperate with, facilitate or encourage any effort or
attempt by any Person (other than Parent and its agents and advisors) to
effect any Alternative Transaction, (v) execute, enter into or become bound by
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, other Contract or

any Acquisition Proposal to the vote of any Company Securityholder or (vii)
enter into any other transaction not in the Ordinary Course of Business, the
consummation of which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with,
prevent or materially delay the Merger. If any Company Representative, whether
in his or her capacity as such or in any other capacity, takes any action that
the Company is obligated pursuant to this Section 5.8(a) to cause such Company
Representative not to take, then the Company shall be deemed for all purposes
of this Agreement to have breached this Section 5.8(a).

(b) The Company shall notify Parent within 24 hours after receipt by any of
the Acquired Companies (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, by any of the
Company Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, or any other notice that

Companies, subject to the terms of that certain Confidentiality Agreement by

making available all financial information reasonably requested by Parent and

ARTICLE 6 
PARENT COVENANTS

Except as otherwise provided below, during the time period from the Agreement
Date until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time or (b) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article 8,
Parent covenants and agrees with the Company as follows:

6.1 Advise of Changes. Parent shall promptly advise the Company in writing of
(a) any event occurring subsequent to the Agreement Date that would render any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in Article 4
untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) could
reasonably be expected to not be satisfied, or (b) any breach of any covenant
or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, any Parent
Ancillary Agreement or any Merger Sub Ancillary Agreement such that the
condition set forth in Section 7.3(b) could reasonably be expected to not be
satisfied.

6.2 Regulatory Approvals. Parent shall promptly execute and file, or join in
the execution and filing of, any application, notification or other document
that may be necessary in order to obtain the authorization, approval or
consent of any Governmental Authority, whether foreign, federal, state, local
or municipal, which may be required in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Parent
Ancillary Agreement or any Merger Sub Ancillary Agreement. Parent shall make
all filings required of it under the HSR Act or other antitrust Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as reasonably
practicable and shall comply as soon as reasonably practicable and to the
extent necessary with any formal or informal request under the HSR Act or
other antitrust Laws for additional information, documents or other materials
received from the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Authority acting pursuant to its antitrust authority. Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations,
approvals and consents and shall pay any associated filing fees payable by
Parent with respect to such authorizations, approvals and consents. Subject to
applicable Laws and orders, Parent shall promptly inform the Company of any
communication between Parent and any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if any Action is instituted (or threatened in
writing to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Law, it is expressly understood and agreed that
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be under any
obligation to: (a) litigate or contest any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding or any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, or (b) make proposals, execute or carry
out agreements or submit to orders providing for (i) the sale, divestiture or
other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) or the
Company, or the holding separate of the shares of Company Capital Stock or
(ii) the imposition of any limitation on the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to freely conduct their business or own such assets
or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of
Company Capital Stock.

6.3 Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all of the conditions
precedent set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3, and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be consummated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

6.4 Indemnification of Company Directors and Officers.

(l) If the Merger is consummated, then until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of the Acquired Companies to their
present and former directors and officers (the "Company Indemnified Parties")
pursuant to indemnification agreements with the Acquired Companies in effect
on the Agreement Date and identified on Schedule 6.4(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and pursuant to the Company's Articles of Incorporation or
bylaws, in each case, as in effect on the Agreement Date (the "Company
Indemnification Provisions"), with respect to claims arising out of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time which are asserted after
the Effective Time. Any claims for indemnification made under this Section
6.4(a) on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time shall
survive such anniversary until the final resolution thereof. However, the
foregoing covenants under this Section 6.4(a) shall not apply to (i) any claim
or matter that relates to a willful or intentional breach of a representation,
warranty or covenant made by the Company in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) any claim based on a claim for
which a Parent Indemnified Person would be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Article 9. In the event of a breach of the representation set
forth in the last sentence of Section 3.6, this Section 6.4(a) shall be
terminated with respect to any claim not disclosed in Schedule 3.6 of the
Company Disclosure Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained in the Company Indemnification Provisions,
no Company Indemnified Party shall be entitled to coverage under any Parent
director and officer insurance policy or errors and omission policy unless
such Company Indemnified Party is separately eligible for coverage under such
policy pursuant to Parent's policies and procedures and the terms of such
insurance policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such indemnity shall be
provided if such claim was the result of any Company Indemnified Party's gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

(m) Parent shall maintain (or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain) the
Insurance Coverage in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder during the term thereof; provided, however, that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay any
additional amounts following the Closing with respect to such Insurance
Coverage, including any additional amounts to maintain such Insurance
Coverage.

(n) This Section 6.4 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended
to benefit each Company Indemnified Party, shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable
by the Company Indemnified Parties (each of whom is an intended third party
beneficiary of this Section 6.4); provided, however, that recourse shall first
be against the Insurance Coverage until it is exhausted before recovery
against Parent shall take place.

(o) The provisions of this Section 6.4 shall in no way affect the rights of
the Parent Indemnified Persons or the obligations of the Company Stockholders
arising under Article 9, and any Liabilities subject to indemnification
pursuant to Section 6.4(a) or to be covered by Insurance Coverage pursuant to
Section 6.4(b) shall in no event include any Damages for which any Company
Stockholder is liable (either directly or through an obligation to indemnify
another Person) pursuant to the terms hereof.

(p) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.4.

6.5 Continuation of Certain Company Benefit Arrangements.

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date
which is 12 months from the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide each employee who remains employed
immediately after the Closing Date ("Company Continuing Employee") with: (i)
base salary or hourly wages which are no less than the base salary or hourly
wages provided by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii)
target bonus opportunities which are no less than the target bonus
opportunities provided by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date,
and (iii) employee benefits that are (A) no less favorable in the aggregate
than those provided by the Company's existing Company Employee Plans as of the
date hereof (or modifications thereto that are approved by the Company's
officers) or (B) provided by Parent to similarly situated employees in similar
locations of Parent. No later than February 28, 2015, Parent shall pay, or
cause to be paid, all cash bonuses that are earned, due and payable under the
Company's 2014 annual cash bonus plan to the employees of the Acquired
Companies that are employed by Parent or its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) at the time of such payment.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan of Parent in which any Company
Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Closing Date
(collectively, "Parent Benefit Plans"), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Continuing
Employees with the Acquired Companies as if such service were with Parent or
its Affiliates for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate in any
Parent Benefit Plan; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition,
with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent or its Affiliates shall (i) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be waived any pre-existing
condition exclusion or waiting periods that apply to the Company Continuing
Employees, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the
comparable plans of the Company and its Affiliates and (ii) provide each
Company Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents with credit for
any eligible expenses incurred under any Company Employee Plan for purposes of
satisfying the co-payment, deductible and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Company Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
corresponding Parent Benefit Plans.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no employee of any of the Acquired Companies
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement and no provision of this Section 6.5 shall create such rights in any
such persons. Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee employment for any period of
time or preclude the ability of Parent, any Acquired Company or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate the employment or service of any Person at any time
and for any reason, (ii) require Parent, any Acquired Company or the Surviving
Corporation to continue any Company Benefit Arrangement or other employee
benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof after the Effective Time or (iii) amend any Company
Benefit Arrangement or other employee benefit plans or arrangements.

which by its nature cannot be cured) and (B) if not cured on or prior to the

Expiration Date; provided, however, that: (a) the Specified Representations
will remain operative and in full force and effect until the 60th day

contract); (b) no right to indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 in
respect of any claim based upon any failure of a representation or warranty to
be true and correct that is set forth in a Notice of Claim delivered in

claim based upon any failure of a representation or warranty to be true and
correct that is set forth in a Notice of Claim delivered in accordance with
Section 9.5 prior to the applicable expiration date of such representation or

date of such covenant shall be affected by the expiration of such covenant.

terms speaks only as of a specific date or dates, in which case as though made
as of such specific date or dates) and any failure of any certification to be
made by the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(a) to be true and correct as of

other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) alleging

or dates) and any failure of any certification to be made by Parent pursuant
to Section 7.3(a) to be true and correct as of the date such certificate shall

(c) In the case of a claim with respect to any of the Company Representation
Indemnities, each Company Indemnifying Party shall be severally and not
jointly liable for such Company Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of any
Damages resulting therefrom up to an amount equal to the General Escrow Amount
and recovery from the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy under
this Agreement for any such claim for indemnification, except in the case of
(i) fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation or (ii) any failure
of any of the Specified Representations to be true and correct as set forth in
Section 9.2(a). In the case of a claim with respect to any of the Parent
Representation Indemnities, the Parent Indemnifying Parties shall be jointly
and severally liable for any Damages resulting therefrom up to an amount equal
to the General Escrow Amount, except in the case of (A) fraud, willful breach
or intentional misrepresentation or (B) any failure of any of the Specified
Representations to be true and correct as set forth in Section 9.3(a).

(d) In the case of (i) any failure of any of the Specified Representations to
be true and correct as set forth in Section 9.2(a), (ii) any claim for
indemnification made pursuant to clauses (b) through (h) of Section 9.2, (iii)
any claim for indemnification made pursuant to clause (i) of Section 9.2
arising out of an alleged breach of any Specified Representation or the
matters described in clauses (b) through (h) of Section 9.2, and (iv) any
claim for indemnification arising out of fraud, willful breach or intentional
misrepresentation, each Company Indemnifying Party shall be severally and not
jointly liable for such Company Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of any
Damages resulting therefrom up to the aggregate portion of the Final Adjusted
Transaction Value received by such Company Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Article 2. Any Damages recoverable by the Parent Indemnified Persons (A)
pursuant to indemnification claims under this Article 9 (other than with
respect to the Special Tax Indemnities) shall be paid first out of the portion
of the Escrow Fund constituting the General Escrow Amount and second, if the
portion of the Escrow Fund constituting the General Escrow Amount is
insufficient to satisfy such Damages in full or if the portion of the Escrow
Fund constituting the General Escrow Amount has been released in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement, by the Company Indemnifying Parties, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article 9 and (B) pursuant to indemnification
claims with respect to the Special Tax Indemnities shall be paid first out of
the portion of the Escrow Fund constituting the Tax Escrow Amount, second out
of the remaining funds in the Escrow Fund, and third, if the Escrow Fund is
insufficient to satisfy such Damages in full or if the Escrow Fund has been
released in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, by the Company Indemnifying
Parties, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 9. In the case
of (1) any failure of any of the Specified Representations to be true and
correct as set forth in Section 9.3(a), and (2) any claim for indemnification
arising out of fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation, the
Parent Indemnifying Parties shall be jointly and severally liable for any
Damages resulting therefrom up to the Final Adjusted Transaction Value in the
aggregate.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, there shall be no maximum
liability for any Company Indemnifying Party (i) who committed fraud or made
any intentional misrepresentation in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or willfully breached this Agreement or (ii)
who has actual knowledge of such fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
willful breach.

(f) No Parent Indemnified Person may receive any portion of the Escrow Fund in
respect of any claim for indemnification that is made pursuant to the Company
Representation Indemnities (in each case except for any claims (i) with
respect to any Specified Representations, or (ii) which involve fraud, willful
breach or intentional misrepresentation), unless and until Damages in the
aggregate under all claims that have been incurred, paid or properly accrued
exceed $570,000 (the "Basket"), in which case the Parent Indemnified Persons
may make claims for indemnification for all Damages, including the amount of
the Basket. No Securityholder Indemnified Person may receive any proceeds from
Parent in respect of any claim for indemnification that is made pursuant to
the Parent Representation Indemnities (in each case except for any claims (x)
with respect to any Specified Representations, or (y) which involve fraud,
willful breach or intentional misrepresentation), unless and until Damages in
the aggregate under all claims that have been incurred, paid or properly
accrued exceed the Basket, in which case the Securityholder Indemnified
Persons may make claims for indemnification for all Damages, including the
amount of the Basket. In determining the amount of any Damages in respect of
the failure of any representation or warranty to be true and correct as of any
particular date, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect standard contained
in such representation or warranty shall be disregarded; provided, however,
that this sentence shall not apply in connection with determining the amount
of any Damages in respect of the failure of any Specified Representation to be
true and correct as of any particular date (and, as a result, any materiality
or Material Adverse Effect standards contained in such Specified
Representation shall not be disregarded in connection with determining the
amount of such Damages).

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of
calculating or determining the amount of Damages incurred under Section 9.2 or
Section 9.3, there shall be deducted from any Damages an amount equal to the
amount of any proceeds actually received by any Parent Indemnified Person or
Securityholder Indemnified Person from any third-party insurer in connection
with such Damages (after giving effect to any deductible or increase in
premium proximately caused thereby to the extent paid or payable and net of
any costs and expenses of recovery or collection thereof); provided, however,
that none of the Parent Indemnified Persons, the Securityholder Indemnified
Persons or the Representative shall have any obligation to (i) seek recovery
against any existing insurance policies (other than insurance policies of the
Company that are in existence as of the time of Closing (disregarding any
renewal or extension thereof)) or (ii) obtain insurance coverage or other
third party protection with respect to any particular matter.

(h) No Parent Indemnified Person or Securityholder Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to double recovery for any adjustments to the Merger Consideration
provided for hereunder or for any indemnifiable Damages even though such
Damages may have resulted from the breach of more than one of the
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants in this Agreement.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
under no circumstances will any party be liable to the other for any punitive,
speculative or remote damages or any damages that are not the reasonably
foreseeable consequence of any breach of or inaccuracy contained in this
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter or any certificate, document or
agreement contemplated by or required to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement (except to the extent such damages are awarded to a third party
pursuant to a Third-Party Claim).

(j) No Parent Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement in respect of any Damages to the extent such Damages were taken
into account in the calculation of, and reduced the value of (i) the Final
Adjusted Transaction Value, including the calculation of the Closing Debt
Amount or the amount of Transaction Fees (including the Closing Employee
Payments) or (ii) the Closing Working Capital Amount.

(k) The rights to indemnification set forth in this Agreement based on the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and obligations set forth
herein shall not be affected by any investigation conducted by Parent or the
Company, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time
(whether before or after the Agreement Date or the Closing Date), with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation.

(l) The parties acknowledge the applicability of the common law duty to
mitigate Damages.

9.5 Notice of Claim.

(z) As used herein, the term "Claim" means a claim for indemnification of an
Indemnified Party for Damages under this Article 9.

(aa) The applicable Indemnified Party shall give written notice of a Claim
executed by an authorized representative of such Indemnified Party (a "Notice
of Claim") to the Indemnitor (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if the Claim
involves recovery against the Escrow Fund) reasonably promptly after the
Indemnified Party becomes aware of the existence of any potential claim for
indemnification under this Article 9, arising from or relating to:

(i) any matter specified in Section 9.2 or Section 9.3; or

(ii) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against any Indemnified
Party of an Action brought by a third party against such Indemnified Party
that is based on, arises out of, or relates to subject matter that, if
determined adversely to such Indemnified Party (regardless of the eventual
outcome of such Action), could result in a Claim (in each such case, a "Third-
Party Claim").

(bb) No delay on the part of an Indemnified Party in giving the Indemnitor a
Notice of Claim (or any update or amendment thereto after conducting discovery
regarding the underlying facts and circumstances set forth therein) shall
relieve the Representative or any Company Indemnifying Party, on the one hand,
or any Parent Indemnifying Party, on the other hand, from any of their
respective obligations under this Article 9 unless (and then only to the
extent that) the Representative or the Company Indemnifying Parties, on the
one hand, or the Parent Indemnifying Parties, on the other hand, are
materially prejudiced thereby in terms of the amount of Damages for which such
Persons are obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.

9.6 Defense of Third-Party Claims.

(y) The Indemnified Party shall determine and conduct the investigation,
defense or settlement of any Third-Party Claim, and the costs and expenses
incurred or paid by the Indemnified Party in connection with such
investigation, defense or settlement (including attorneys' fees, other
professionals' and experts' fees, costs of investigation and court or
arbitration costs) shall be included in the Damages for which the Indemnified
Party may seek indemnification pursuant to a Claim made by any Indemnified
Party hereunder, regardless of the resolution of such Third-Party Claim and
whether it is ultimately determined that such Third-Party Claim arose out of,
resulted from or was in connection with a matter for which indemnity is
otherwise provided pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3.

(z) The Indemnitor shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings,
notices and communications with respect to the Third-Party Claim to the extent
that receipt of such documents by the Indemnitor does not affect any privilege
relating to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party shall provide the
Indemnitor the opportunity to consult with and participate in, but not to
determine or conduct, any defense of the Third-Party Claim or settlement
negotiations with respect to the Third-Party Claim, all at the sole expense of
the Indemnitor.

(aa) No settlement of any such Third-Party Claim with any third party claimant
shall be determinative of the amount of Damages relating to such matter,
except with the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be deemed to
have been given unless the Indemnitor shall have objected within 30 days after
written request for such consent by the Indemnified Party.

9.7 Contents of Notice of Claim. Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnified Party
given pursuant to Section 9.5 shall contain the following information: (a)
that such Indemnified Party has directly or indirectly incurred, paid or
properly accrued or, in good faith, believes it shall have to directly or
indirectly incur, pay or accrue, Damages in an aggregate stated amount arising
from such Claim (which amount may be an estimated amount or may be the amount
of Damages claimed by a third party in a Third-Party Claim); and (b) a brief
description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably available to such
Indemnified Party), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the
alleged Damages based on such Indemnified Party's good faith belief thereof,
including, to the extent reasonably available to such Indemnified Party: (i)
the identity and address of any third-party claimant, (ii) copies of any
formal demand or complaint and (iii) the specific nature of the breach to
which such item is related; provided, however, that the Notice of Claim may be
updated and amended from time to time by the Indemnified Party in good faith
by delivering an updated or amended Notice of Claim to the Indemnitor, so long
as the delivery of the original Notice of Claim is made within the applicable
claims period and such update or amendment only asserts bases for liability
reasonably related to the underlying facts and circumstances specifically set
forth in such original Notice of Claim; provided further, that all Claims for
Damages properly set forth in the original Notice of Claim or any permitted
update or amendment thereto shall remain outstanding until such Claims for
Damages have been finally resolved or satisfied, notwithstanding the
expiration of such claims period.

9.8 Resolution of Notice of Claim.

(u) Each Notice of Claim given by an Indemnified Party shall be resolved as
follows:

(i) Uncontested Claims. If, within 30 days after a Notice of Claim is received
by the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor does not contest such Notice of Claim in
writing to the Indemnified Party (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if the Claim
involves recovery against the Escrow Fund) as provided in Section 9.8(a)(ii),
the Indemnitor shall be conclusively deemed to have consented, on behalf of
all Company Indemnifying Parties or Parent Indemnifying Parties, as
applicable, to the recovery by the Indemnified Party of the full amount of
Damages (subject to the limitations contained in this Article 9) specified in
the Notice of Claim in accordance with this Article 9, including the
forfeiture of all or a portion of the Escrow Fund, and, without further
notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final judgment for damages
against the Company Indemnifying Parties or Parent Indemnifying Parties, as
applicable, for such amount in any court having jurisdiction over the matter
where venue is proper.

(ii) Contested Claims. If the Indemnitor gives the Indemnified Party written
notice contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a "Contested
Claim") (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if the Claim involves recovery
against the Escrow Fund) within the 30-day period specified in Section
9.8(a)(i), then such Contested Claim shall be resolved by either (A) a written
settlement agreement executed by Parent and the Representative (a copy of
which shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent if the Claim involves recovery
against the Escrow Fund) or (B) in the absence of such a written settlement
agreement within 30 days following receipt by the Indemnified Party of the
written notice from the Indemnitor, by binding litigation between Parent and
the Representative in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section
9.8(b).

(v) Litigation of Contested Claims. Either Parent or the Representative may
bring suit in the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of
the United States of America located within the State of Delaware to resolve a
Contested Claim. The decision of the trial court as to the validity and amount
of any claim in such Notice of Claim shall be nonappealable, binding and
conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the Company Indemnifying
Parties, the Parent Indemnifying Parties and the Escrow Agent, as applicable,
shall be obligated to act in accordance with such decision and make or
withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Judgment
upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. For purposes of this Section 9.8(b), in any suit hereunder in
which any claim or the amount thereof stated in a Notice of Claim is at issue,
the party seeking indemnification shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing
party unless the trial court awards such party more than one-half of the
amount in dispute, in which case the party from whom indemnification is sought
shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to a
suit shall pay its own expenses and the expenses, including attorneys' fees
and documented out-of-pocket costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to
the suit.

(w) If any amount is determined, agreed or deemed agreed to be owed to any
Parent Indemnified Person in accordance with this Section 9.8, then within
three Business Days following the date such amount is determined, agreed or
deemed agreed to be owed, Parent and the Representative shall execute and
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to release such amount to the Parent Indemnified Person from the Escrow
Fund (to the extent of the Escrow Fund) as follows: (i) a number of Escrow
Shares having an aggregate Value equal to the product of (A) such amount,
multiplied by (B) the Stock Percentage, and (ii) an amount of cash equal to
the product of (A) such amount, multiplied by (B) the Cash Percentage. For
purposes of this Article 9, the "Value" of any Escrow Shares delivered to a
Parent Indemnified Person in satisfaction of a Claim shall be equal to the
product of (x) the Average Trading Price (subject to equitable adjustment in
the event of any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split or similar
event affecting the Parent Common Stock after the Effective Time), multiplied
by (y) the number of Escrow Shares.

9.9 Release of Remaining Escrow Fund.

(f) General Escrow Amount. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Expiration Date, Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver (based on
each Company Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount) to the
Company Indemnifying Parties (other than the holders of Withholding Options),
and, on behalf of the holders of Withholding Options, to the Surviving
Corporation or an Affiliate thereof, for subsequent release to such holders of
Withholding Options as part of the second regularly scheduled payroll cycle of
the Surviving Corporation or such Affiliate following such release, all of the
funds in the Escrow Fund (if any) attributable to the General Escrow Amount in
excess of any amounts in the Escrow Fund that is necessary to satisfy all
unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims for Damages specified in any Notice
of Claim delivered to the Representative before the Expiration Date (based on
the total maximum amount of Damages then being claimed by Parent Indemnified
Persons in such unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims). If any Claims are
unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed as of the Expiration Date, then the Escrow
Agent shall retain possession and custody of that portion of the Escrow Fund
that equals the total maximum amount of Damages then being claimed by Parent
Indemnified Persons in all such unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims,
and as soon as all such Claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver (based on the Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount of each Company
Indemnifying Party) to the Company Indemnifying Parties (other than the
holders of Withholding Options), and, on behalf of the holders of Withholding
Options, to the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof, for subsequent
release to such holders of Withholding Options as part of the second regularly
scheduled payroll cycle of the Surviving Corporation or such Affiliate
following such release, all remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund (if any)
attributable to the General Escrow Amount not required to satisfy such Claims.

(g) Tax Escrow Amount. As soon as reasonably practicable following the earlier
of (i) the final resolution of all Claims with respect to the Special Tax
Indemnities or (ii) the Tax Escrow Expiration Date, Parent shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to deliver (based on each Company Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata
Share of the Escrow Amount) to the Company Indemnifying Parties (other than
the holders of Withholding Options), and, on behalf of the holders of
Withholding Options, to the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof, for
subsequent release to such holders of Withholding Options as part of the
second regularly scheduled payroll cycle of the Surviving Corporation or such
Affiliate following such release, all of the Escrow Fund (if any) in excess of
any amounts in the Escrow Fund that is necessary to satisfy all unresolved,
unsatisfied or disputed Claims for Damages specified in any Notice of Claim
delivered to the Representative before the Tax Escrow Expiration Date (based
on the total maximum amount of Damages then being claimed by Parent
Indemnified Persons in such unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims). If
any Claims are unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed as of the Tax Escrow
Expiration Date, then the Escrow Agent shall retain possession and custody of
that portion of the Escrow Fund that equals the total maximum amount of
Damages then being claimed by Parent Indemnified Persons in all such
unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims, and as soon as all such Claims
have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver (based on the Pro Rata
Share of the Escrow Amount of each Company Indemnifying Party) to the Company
Indemnifying Parties (other than the holders of Withholding Options), and, on
behalf of the holders of Withholding Options, to the Surviving Corporation or
an Affiliate thereof, for subsequent release to such holders of Withholding
Options as part of the second regularly scheduled payroll cycle of the
Surviving Corporation or such Affiliate following such release, all remaining
amounts in the Escrow Fund (if any) not required to satisfy such Claims.

9.10 Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments. All payments (if any) made
to a Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to any indemnification obligations
under this Article 9 will be treated as adjustments to the purchase price for
Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern for purposes of this
Agreement, unless otherwise required by Law.

9.11 No Right of Contribution. No Company Indemnifying Party or the
Representative acting on their behalf shall make any claim for indemnification
or contribution from Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
Affiliate, assign or successor of any of the foregoing with respect to any
indemnity claims arising under or in connection with this Agreement to the
extent that the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Parent Indemnified
Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder for such claim, it being
acknowledged and agreed that the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Company are solely for the benefit of the Parent Indemnified
Persons.

9.12 Exclusive Remedy. Following the Closing, except for claims based on
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach and except as
contemplated by Section 11.5: (a) the rights to indemnification provided by
Sections 9.2 and 9.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any Damages of
any Indemnified Party with respect to any breach of this Agreement by the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, or with
respect to any of the matters set forth in Sections 9.2 and 9.3, (b) all
statutes of limitations or other claims periods with respect to claims for
Damages based on the matters that are subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.1 shall be shortened to the applicable claims periods and survival
periods set forth in Section 9.1 and (c) the Parent Indemnified Persons and
the Securityholder Indemnified Persons irrevocably waive any and all rights
they may have to make claims against any Company Indemnifying Party or Parent
Indemnifying Party, respectively, under statutory and common law with respect
to any breach of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or
Merger Sub, on the other hand, or with respect to any of the matters set forth
in Sections 9.2 and 9.3.

9.13 Appointment of Representative.

(d) By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Merger, executing and delivering a Support Agreement or an Option
Surrender Agreement or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits
thereof, each Company Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have approved the
designation of and hereby designates the Representative as the representative
of the Company Indemnifying Parties and as the attorney-in-fact and agent for
and on behalf of each Company Indemnifying Party with respect to Claims under
this Article 9 and the taking by the Representative of any and all actions and
the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the
Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any Company
Ancillary Agreement to which such Company Indemnified Party is a party in its
capacity as a Company Indemnifying Party, including the exercise of the power
to: (i) give and receive notices and communications to or from Parent (on
behalf of itself or any other Parent Indemnified Person) and/or the Escrow
Agent relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, any Company Ancillary
Agreement to which such Company Indemnified Party is a party in its capacity
as a Company Indemnifying Party, or any of the transactions and other matters
contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or any Company Ancillary Agreement to which such Company
Indemnified Party is a party in its capacity as a Company Indemnifying Party
expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or
received by such Company Indemnifying Party individually), (ii) authorize the
release or delivery to Parent of all or a portion of the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of Claims by Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Person
pursuant to this Article 9 (including by not objecting to such Claims), (iii)
agree to, object to, negotiate, resolve, enter into settlements and
compromises of, demand litigation of, and comply with orders of courts with
respect to (A) Claims by Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Person
pursuant to this Article 9 or (B) any dispute between any Parent Indemnified
Person and any such Company Indemnifying Party, in each case, relating to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and (iv) take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Representative for the accomplishment of
the foregoing. Either John Chapple or Gary O'Malley may take any action as the
Representative hereunder without the signature or consent of the other. The
Representative shall have authority and power to act on behalf of each Company
Indemnifying Party with respect to the disposition, settlement or other
handling of all Claims under this Article 9 and all rights or obligations
arising under this Article 9. The Company Indemnifying Parties shall be bound
by all actions taken and documents executed by the Representative in
connection with this Article 9, and Parent and the other Parent Indemnified
Persons shall be entitled to rely on any action or decision of the
Representative. The Company Indemnifying Parties recognize and intend that the
power of attorney granted in this Section 9.13(a) and the powers, immunities
and rights to indemnification granted to the Representative hereunder: (1) are
coupled with an interest and are irrevocable; (2) may be delegated by the
Representative; and (3) shall survive the death, incapacity, dissolution,
liquidation, bankruptcy or winding up of each of the Company Indemnifying
Parties and shall be binding on any successor thereto. Each Company
Indemnifying Party (I) agrees that all actions taken by the Representative
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall be binding upon such
Company Indemnifying Party and such Company Indemnifying Party's successors as
if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such Company Indemnifying
Party and (II) waives any and all defenses which may be available to contest,
negate or disaffirm the action of the Representative taken in good faith under
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Representative shall only have the
duties expressly stated in this Agreement and shall have no other duty,
express or implied. The Representative may engage attorneys, accountants and
other professionals and experts. The Representative may in good faith rely
conclusively upon information, reports, statements and opinions prepared or
presented by such professionals, and any action taken by the Representative
based on such reliance shall be deemed conclusively to have been taken in good
faith. Parent may conclusively rely, without independent verification or
investigation, upon any action of the Representative as being the binding
decision or action of the Company Indemnifying Parties, and Parent shall not
be liable to any Company Indemnified Party or any other Person for any actions
taken or omitted from being taken by them or by Parent in accordance with or
reliance upon any decision or action of the Representative. Prior to the
Effective Time, either John Chapple or Gary O'Malley may resign from his role
as the Representative. The Person serving as the Representative may be
replaced from time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Escrow Fund then on deposit with the Escrow Agent upon not less than 10
Business Days' prior written notice to Parent and the Escrow Agent. No bond
shall be required of the Representative, and the Representative shall receive
no compensation for his, her or its services. Notices or communications to or
from the Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the Company
Indemnifying Parties.

(e) In performing the functions specified in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, the Representative shall not be liable to any Company Indemnifying
Party in the absence of gross negligence or willful breach on the part of the
Representative. Each Company Indemnifying Party shall severally (based on each
such Company Indemnifying Party's respective Pro Rata Share), and not jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless the Representative from and against any loss,
Liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or willful breach on
the part of the Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder, including any out-of-
pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal costs reasonably
incurred by the Representative (together, the "Representative Expenses") if
not paid directly to the Representative by the Company Indemnifying Parties,
such Representative Expenses may be recovered by the Representative (i) first,
from the Expense Fund Amount and (ii) second, to the extent the Expense Fund
Amount is insufficient, from funds in the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable
to the Company Indemnifying Parties (and not distributed or distributable to
any Parent Indemnified Person or subject to a pending Claim of any Parent
Indemnified Person) following the Expiration Date, at the time of
distribution, so long as the Representative has delivered to the Escrow Agent
prior to such time a certificate setting forth such Representative Expenses
actually incurred, and such recovery will be made from the Company
Indemnifying Parties according to their respective Pro Rata Shares.

(f) Each of John Chapple and Gary O'Malley (in his capacity as the
Representative) represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as of the
Agreement Date and as of the Closing Date as follows: (i) the Representative
has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and any other applicable other contract, instrument or document contemplated
hereby and to perform his respective obligations hereunder and thereunder,
(ii) this Agreement and any other applicable contract, instrument or document
contemplated hereby has been duly executed and delivered by the Representative
and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Representative,
enforceable in accordance with its terms and (iii) neither the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or any other applicable contract,
instrument or document contemplated hereby by the Representative nor the
consummation of the Merger will conflict with, or result in a termination,
breach, impairment or violation of any applicable Law or Contract to which the
Representative or its assets or properties is bound.

(g) Upon the payment of the Expense Fund Amount by Parent or its designee to
the segregated client bank account maintained by the Representative for the
Expense Fund Amount pursuant to Section 2.4(c), each Company Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have contributed his, her or its Pro Rata Share of
the Expense Fund Amount. The Representative shall hold the Expense Fund Amount
in accordance with this Agreement on behalf of the Company Indemnifying
Parties as a fund which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or
reimbursing the Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Company Indemnifying Parties will not
receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund Amount and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund Amount other than
as a result of its gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The
Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will
not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes
and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the
event of bankruptcy. Contemporaneous with or as soon as practicable following
the release in full of the Escrow Fund, the Representative will deliver the
balance of the Expense Fund Amount to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Company Indemnifying Parties (other than the holders of
Withholding Options) and to the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof,
on behalf of the holders of Withholding Options, for subsequent release to
such holders of Withholding Options as part of the second regularly scheduled
payroll cycle of the Surviving Corporation or such Affiliate following such
delivery, in each case, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.
For Tax purposes, the Expense Fund Amount will be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Company Indemnifying Parties at the
time of Closing.

ARTICLE 10 
TAX MATTERS

10.1 Tax Returns.

(m) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared
and timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Acquired Companies that
are required to be filed (taking into account any extension) on or before the
Closing Date, and the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of the
Acquired Companies due on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall
be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
the past practices of the Company with respect to such items, except as
required by Law. At least 15 Business Days prior to filing any such Tax
Return, the Company shall submit a copy of such Tax Return, along with
supporting workpapers, to Parent for Parent's review and approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(n) Except for Special Tax Returns, which shall be handled in accordance with
Section 10.3(c), following the Closing Date, Parent shall file all Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date. Parent
shall permit the Representative, at the Company Stockholders' expense, to
review and comment on each such Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period at least 15 days prior to filing. The Representative shall be entitled
to comment on such Tax Returns and the Parent shall consider such comments in
good faith. To the extent any such Tax Return is not prepared consistent with
the past practices of the Company, except as required by Law, Parent shall
make changes to such Tax Return reasonably requested by the Representative. If
the Parent does not receive comments from the Representative at least five
days prior to the filing of such Tax Returns, the Representative shall be
deemed to have no comments to such Tax Returns.

(o) Not later than 10 days prior to the due date of the payment of Taxes on
any Tax Returns which Parent has the responsibility to cause to be filed
pursuant to Section 10.1(b), without duplication of, or prejudice to, the
Parent Indemnified Persons' rights to indemnification under Section 9.2,
Parent shall be entitled to withdraw from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to
the amount of Indemnified Taxes, as reasonably determined by Parent, due in
respect of such Tax Returns.

(p) Without the prior written consent of the Representative and except as
required by Law, Parent shall not, and shall not allow any Acquired Company
to, amend any Tax Return of any Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or carry back any item to any Tax Return of any Acquired Company for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period to the extent such amended Tax Return or carryback could
reasonably be expected to result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement.

10.2 Cooperation. Parent and the Representative agree to furnish or cause to
be furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to Taxes, including access to books and
records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by
Parent or the Representative, the making of any election relating to Taxes,
the preparation for any audit by any Tax authority and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. For clarity,
such cooperation by Parent shall include, subject to Section 10.3(c),
reasonable assistance relating to the preparing and filing by the
Representative of any Special Tax Returns or entering into any voluntary
disclosure agreements or other agreements relating to any Special Tax
Indemnities Taxes. Each of Parent, the Company and the Representative shall
retain all books and records in their possession with respect to Taxes for a
period of at least seven years following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision herein to the contrary, including Section
9.6(b), in no event shall the Representative be entitled to review or
otherwise have access to any income Tax Return, or information related
thereto, of Parent or its Affiliates (other than income Tax Returns of the
Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods).

10.3 Tax Audits.

(m) If notice of any Action with respect to Taxes of the Acquired Companies (a
"Tax Claim") shall be received by any party for which any other party may
reasonably be expected to be liable, the notified party shall notify such
other party or parties in writing of such Tax Claim; provided, however, that
the failure of the notified party to give any other party notice as provided
herein shall not relieve such other party of its indemnification obligations
under Article 9 or this Article 10 except to the extent that such other party
is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Tax Claims shall be considered
Third-Party Claims for purposes of Article 9. Notwithstanding any provision
herein to the contrary, to the extent that a provision of this Section 10.3
directly conflicts with any provision of Article 9, this Section 10.3 shall
govern.

(n) Parent shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Claim with
respect to a Straddle Period of any Acquired Company (a "Straddle Tax Claim").
To the extent a Straddle Tax Claim relates to the amount of Taxes attributable
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, Parent shall
keep the Representative informed of all developments on a timely basis, shall
provide to the Representative copies of any and all material correspondence
from any Governmental Authority related to such Straddle Tax Claim and shall
provide the Representative with the opportunity to attend conferences with the
relevant Governmental Authority (if reasonably practical) and to review and
provide comments with respect to written responses provided to the relevant
Governmental Authority. Parent shall not settle, compromise or abandon any
Straddle Tax Claim which relates to or may reasonably give rise to Indemnified
Taxes without the prior written consent of the Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(o) The Representative shall have the right to control the conduct of the
portion of any Tax Claim, including the preparing and filing of any Special
Tax Returns or entering into any voluntary disclosure agreements or other
agreements relating to any Special Tax Indemnities Taxes, with respect to any
taxable period of any of the Acquired Companies that relate exclusively to a
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (excluding any Straddle
Period) (a "Pre-Closing Tax Claim"). The Representative shall keep Parent
informed of all developments on a timely basis, shall provide to Parent copies
of any and all material correspondence from any Governmental Authority related
to such Pre-Closing Tax Claim and shall provide Parent with the opportunity to
attend conferences with the relevant Governmental Authority and to review and
provide comments with respect to written responses provided to the relevant
Governmental Authority and to comment on and approve Special Tax Returns. Each
party shall bear its own costs for participating in such Pre-Closing Tax Claim
(provided that the Representative's costs shall be considered Representative
Expenses as contemplated by Section 9.13(b)). The Representative shall not
settle, compromise or abandon any Pre-Closing Tax Claim without the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

10.4 Transfer Taxes. Any transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby ("Transfer Taxes") will be borne by the
Company Stockholders. The Representative and the Company Stockholders agree to
file or cause to be filed in a timely manner all necessary documents
(including all Tax Returns) with respect to all such amounts for which the
Company Stockholders are so liable. The Representative shall provide Parent
with evidence satisfactory to Parent that such Transfer Taxes have been paid
by the Company Stockholders.

10.5 Tax Year. For the federal income Tax period immediately following the
Closing, the Company shall be included on the federal consolidated income Tax
Return of Parent. To the extent consistent with Law, the parties agree and
acknowledge that it is intended that the taxable year of the Company shall end
as of the close of business on the Closing Date for U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income Tax purposes.

10.6 Tax Refunds. Any Tax refund that is received by Parent or any Acquired
Company after the Closing Date or that is credited against any Tax to which
Parent or any Acquired Company becomes entitled, in each case that relate to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall be for the account of the Company
Stockholders and Company Optionholders (in accordance with their Pro Rata
Shares), and Parent shall pay over to the Representative for the benefit of
the Company Stockholders and Company Optionholders (in accordance with their
Pro Rata Shares) any such refund without interest, net of costs, expenses and
Taxes incurred by Parent or any Acquired Company in connection with obtaining
or in connection with the receipt or accrual of such refund within 15 days
after receipt or entitlement thereto; provided, however, that Parent shall not
be required to pay over to the Representative Tax refunds or amounts credited
against Taxes if such Tax refunds or amounts credited against Taxes are (a)
included in the calculation of, and increased the value of, the Closing
Working Capital Amount pursuant to Section 2.3 or have previously been taken
into account in the determination of Indemnified Taxes or (b) attributable to
a carry-back of net operating losses or other Tax attributes from any taxable
period (or portion of any Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing Date.

ARTICLE 11 
MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 Governing Law. Except to the extent a provision of Article 2 is required
by Law to be governed by the WBCA, this Agreement shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware,
irrespective of its conflicts of law principles. The parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America located within
the State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement
of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including resolution of disputes under Section 9.8(b)), and hereby waive, and
agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject
thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect
to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware
State or Federal court; provided that a judgment rendered by such court may be
enforced in any court having competent jurisdiction. The parties hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in Section 11.9 or in such other manner as may be
permitted by Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. With respect
to any particular action, suit or proceeding, venue shall lie solely in the
State of Delaware.

11.2 Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of Parent, including any
successor to, or assignee of, all or substantially all of the business and
assets of Parent. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no party
hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of this
provision shall be void.

11.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or unenforceable,
then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to
other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect

void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.

11.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including via facsimile, .pdf or other electronic means), each
of which shall be an original as regards any party whose signature appears
thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more counterparts
hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the signatures of all
parties reflected hereon as signatories.

11.5 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
Law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy
for any such damage. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any State having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

11.6 Amendments and Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively), only by a writing signed by Parent, the Company and the
Representative. The waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the
performance hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other
default or any succeeding breach or default. This Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto as provided in this Section 11.6 at any time before or
after adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders, but, after such
adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires the further
approval of the Company Stockholders without obtaining such further approval.
At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent may,
to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to it contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for its benefit contained herein. No such waiver or
extension shall be effective unless signed in writing by the party against
whom such waiver or extension is asserted. The failure of any party to enforce
any of the provisions hereof shall not be construed to be a waiver of the
right of such party thereafter to enforce such provisions.

11.7 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whether or not
the Merger is successfully consummated, each party shall bear its respective
legal, accountants, and financial advisory fees and other expenses incurred
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, it being the intention of the parties that if the Merger is
consummated, the Transaction Fees be taken into account in calculating the
Adjusted Transaction Value as set forth herein. Parent shall pay 50% of any
filing fee required under the HSR Act.

11.8 Attorneys' Fees. Should suit be brought to enforce or interpret any part
of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, as an
element of the costs of suit and not as damages, reasonable attorneys' fees to
be fixed by the court (including costs, expenses and fees on any appeal). The
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs of suit, regardless of
whether such suit proceeds to final judgment.

11.9 Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted under
this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either hand delivered in
person, sent by facsimile, sent by electronic mail, sent by certified or
registered first-class mail, postage pre-paid, or sent by nationally
recognized express courier service. Such notices and other communications
shall be effective upon receipt if hand delivered or sent during normal
business hours by facsimile or electronic mail (effective as of the delivery
of the facsimile confirmation), three Business Days after mailing if sent by
mail, and one Business Day after dispatch if sent by express courier or after
receipt if not sent during normal business hours by facsimile or electronic
mail, to the following addresses, or such other addresses as any party may
notify the other parties in accordance with this Section 11.9:

11.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any
controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party hereto certifies and acknowledges that (a) no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) each such party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) each such
party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each such party has been induced
to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the waivers and
certifications in this Section 11.10.

11.11 Interpretation; Rules of Construction. The terms "hereof," "herein" and
similar terms refer to this Agreement as a whole (including the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto), and when a reference
is made in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Sections or Articles, such
reference shall be to an Exhibit or Schedule to, Section of or Article of this
Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. The words "include,"
"includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without limitation." When a reference is made to a
specific Law, act or statute, such reference shall include any regulations
promulgated thereunder. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument, or statute, in each case,
as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented (in the case of
agreements or instruments, if permitted under this Agreement), including (in
the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case
of statutes) by succession or comparable successor statutes. The headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The terms
defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement and
include plural as well as the singular. Pronouns of either gender or neuter
shall include, as appropriate, the other pronoun forms. Unless stated
otherwise, the terms "dollars" and "$" shall mean United States dollars. The
parties hereto agree that they have been represented by legal counsel during
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be construed against
the party drafting such agreement or document. When calculating the period of
time before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or
step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a
non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding
Business Day.

11.12 Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. No provisions of this Agreement are
intended, nor shall be interpreted, to provide or create any third party
beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind in any client, customer,
employee, Affiliate, stockholder, partner or any party hereto or any other
Person unless specifically provided otherwise herein and, except as so
provided, all provisions hereof shall be personal solely between the parties
to this Agreement; provided that Section 6.4 is intended to benefit the
Company Indemnified Parties and Article 9 is intended to benefit the Parent
Indemnified Persons and the Securityholder Indemnified Persons.

11.13 Public Announcement. Parent may issue such press releases, and make such
other disclosures regarding the Merger, as it determines are required under
applicable securities Laws or regulatory rules or as it deems otherwise
appropriate; provided that, to the extent reasonably practicable, Parent shall
consult with the Company prior to issuing any such press release or making any
such disclosures regarding the Merger. The Company shall not make any public
announcement relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without Parent's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

11.14 Confidentiality.

(a) The Company and Parent hereby amend the ninth paragraph of the
Confidentiality Agreement in its entirety to read as follows:

"This Agreement shall expire on the earlier of (a) the closing of the merger
contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger among Vonage
Holdings Corp., Thunder Acquisition Corp., Telesphere Networks Ltd., and each
of John Chapple and Gary O'Malley, collectively as the Representative, dated
as of November 4, 2014 (the "Merger Agreement") and (b) one year from the date
of the Merger Agreement, provided that the confidentiality and non-disclosure
obligations of the Receiving Party shall survive the expiration of this
Agreement, and provided, further, that such expiration shall not relieve any
party from liability for breach of this Agreement occurring before such
expiration."

(b) From and after the Closing, the restrictions on the use and disclosure of
Evaluation Material (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply to Parent or its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives (as such term is defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any information relating to the
Company Business.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement or any Company Ancillary Agreement, after the
Closing: (i) all Evaluation Material included in the Company Intellectual
Property Rights or embodied in the Company Technology and Company Intellectual
Property Rights that are not owned by a third Person shall be the confidential
information of Parent (and not of the Acquired Companies or any of their
Affiliates) for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement, regardless of
whether such Evaluation Material or Technology were identified or otherwise
designated as "confidential," and (ii) Parent shall be considered the
"Company" under the Confidentiality Agreement and the Acquired Companies and
any of their Affiliates who have had access to Evaluation Material included in
the Company Intellectual Property Rights or embodied in the Company Technology
or Company Intellectual Property Rights that are not owned by a third Person
shall be considered the "Receiving Party" under the Confidentiality Agreement.
The Acquired Companies and any of their Affiliates who have had or will have
access to such Evaluation Material or Technology shall be bound by the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, and, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent
shall have no obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to
such Evaluation Material or Technology.

(d) The parties agree to continue to abide by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, as amended pursuant to this Section 11.14. The Representative
agrees to hold this Agreement and each document contemplated hereby in
confidence and not disclose the terms of thereof or the transactions
contemplated thereby to any third party.

11.15 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the
Company Ancillary Agreements, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Ancillary Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Merger Sub
Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings, inducements or
conditions, express or implied, written or oral, between the parties with
respect hereto or thereto. The express terms hereof control and supersede any
course of performance or usage of the trade inconsistent with any of the terms
hereof.
