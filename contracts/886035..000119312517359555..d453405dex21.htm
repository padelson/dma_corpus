Agreement and to set forth certain conditions to the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving_

 



-1-   _Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with
all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall
continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in _Article_ __ _
II_. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL.

1.2.  _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York,

or waived of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but

or waived in accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Business Day_ " means any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York time)
other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks in the County of New
York, New York are required or authorized to close.

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _Delaware
Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with and accepted by the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by
the parties in writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger
(the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE II

 

 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_

 

 _of the Surviving Corporation_

 

2.1. _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its
entirety as of the Effective Time to be in the form set forth in _Exhibit A_
to this Agreement, and as so amended shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ ") until
thereafter amended as provided therein or as provided by applicable Law.

 

2.2. _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. The parties hereto shall take all
actions necessary so that the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
(the " _Bylaws_ ") until thereafter amended as provided therein or as provided
by applicable Law.

 

ARTICLE III

_Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

3.1. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The parties hereto shall take
all actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective
Time shall, from and after

 



-2-  the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until

their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the DGCL, the
Charter and the Bylaws.

3.2. _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The parties hereto shall take
all actions necessary so that the officers of the Company at the Effective
Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the DGCL, the Charter and the Bylaws.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

 

 _Exchange of Share Certificates_

 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and
Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary
of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties and (ii)
Shares that are owned by stockholders of the Company who have perfected and
not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL (the Shares referred to in clause (ii), " _Dissenting Shares_ ," and the
Shares referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, " _Excluded Shares_
")) shall be converted into the right to receive $30.00 per Share in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all
of the Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ shall cease to be outstanding, shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate formerly
representing any of the Shares (each, a " _Share Certificate_ ") or otherwise
if the Company then has Shares which are not certificated, the
applicable number of uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (the "
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") (in each case, other than Excluded Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest. 

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Excluded Shares; Certain Subsidiary Owned
Shares_. Each Excluded Share (other than any Converted Share) shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such
Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the
holder thereof may have under _Section_ __ _ 4.2(g)_. Each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other
than Merger Sub) ( the " _Converted Shares_ ") shall be converted into such
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each
such Subsidiarys ownership percentage in the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time is the same as such Subsidiarys
ownership percentage in the Company

 



-3-  immediately prior to the Effective Time (after taking into account the
conversion of Merger Sub common stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(c)_).

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

4.2.  _Exchange of Share Certificates_.

(a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to serve as the paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and shall enter
into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company relating to the Paying
Agents responsibilities with respect to this Agreement.

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent, cash in U.S. Dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration (other than in respect of Excluded Shares) under _Section_ __ _
4.1(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ ").
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than a purpose
expressly provided for in this Agreement. Pending its disbursement in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 4.2_, the Payment Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent, if so directed by Parent or Merger Sub. Any such
investment, if made, must be made in (i) short-term direct obligations of the
United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the
highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the
Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying
Agent to make all payments of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the
Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Shares to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided herein. Payments to holders in respect of
each Company Option, Company RSU Award and Company PSU Award (collectively,
the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") shall be paid through the Companys or the
Surviving Corporations applicable payroll procedures following the Effective
Time at such time as such awards are payable.

(c) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business
Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) (A) a
notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (B) a letter
of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the Share Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as provided in _Section_
__ _ 4.2(f)_) or transfer of the Book-Entry 

 



-4-  Shares to the Paying Agent, such materials to be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent desires with approval of the Company (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and (C) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Share
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as
provided in  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying
Agent in exchange for payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Share Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as provided in  _Section_ __ _
4.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares, together with, in the case of Share
Certificates, the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be reasonably required, the holder of such Share Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Paying Agent
shall be required to deliver to each such holder, a check in the amount (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _
4.2(h)_) of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_.

 

(iii) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon surrender
of any Shares.

 

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon
due surrender of the Share Certificates may be issued to such transferee if
the Share Certificates formerly representing such Shares are presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence
and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent.

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Share Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article IV_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message"
in customary form (or such evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in respect of each such Share and
the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments of the Payment Fund) that remains unclaimed
by, or

 



-5-  otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Share Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares by the one year anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to
the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
who has not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(h)_) upon delivery of the Share Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as provided in _Section_
__ _ 4.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. To the fullest
extent permitted by Law, immediately prior to the date any Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, such Merger Consideration shall become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Person_ " means any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Authority or
other entity of any kind or nature.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Share Certificates_. In the event any Share
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Share Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond reasonably sufficient to indemnify Parent and the Surviving
Corporation against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Share Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(h)_) equal to the number of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Share
Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

(g) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled to receive payments in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL, unless and until such Person fails to comply with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise
loses such Persons rights to receive payment under Section 262 of the DGCL.
If any such Person fails to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give Parent notice of any written demands for
appraisal of Shares promptly after receipt by the Company and shall give
Parent the opportunity to direct and participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands, or agree
to do any of the foregoing.

 



-6- (h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

4.3. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each then
outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") granted under
the Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, fully vest and shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without interest), within
five Business Days following the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) the number of Shares subject to the Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Merger Consideration _over_ (B) the exercise price per Share
of such Company Option. Each Company Option for which the exercise price per
Share is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled
at the Closing without payment of consideration.

(b) _Treatment of Company RSU Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
then outstanding restricted stock unit award, including each such award that
is subject to a performance-based vesting condition measured over a period of
one year, and each deferred share, phantom stock unit, or other right to
receive a Share or the cash value thereof (a " _Company RSU Award_ ") granted
under the Stock Plans shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into:

 

(i) if such Company RSU Award is held by a non-employee director, the right to
receive (without interest), within five Business Days following the Effective
Time (or at such later time as would not result in the imposition of a penalty
under Section 409A of the Code), an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of
Shares subject to such Company RSU Award _multiplied by_ (ii) the Merger
Consideration; or

(ii) if such Company RSU Award is not covered by clause (i) above, an award
(a " _Converted RSU Award_ ") representing the right to receive (without
interest and less applicable withholding taxes) an amount in cash equal to (A)
the number of Shares subject to such Company RSU Award _multiplied by_ (B)
the Merger Consideration. Each Converted RSU Award will be subject to the same
terms and conditions (including payment timing, forfeiture, vesting and
acceleration provisions) that were applicable to the related Company RSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that as of the
Effective Time, (a) any performance-based vesting condition measured over a
period of one year shall be deemed satisfied and shall no longer apply and
the applicable Converted RSU Award shall be subject solely to service-based
vesting and (b) each Converted RSU Award shall vest on the earlier to

 



-7-  occur of its originally scheduled vesting date and the date that is six
months following the Closing Date, subject to continued employment with Parent
and its Subsidiaries through such applicable date (or, upon such Continuing
Employees earlier termination by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates without "cause" or by such Continuing Employee for
"good reason" (as each such term is defined in the Company 2015 Stock
Incentive Plan).

(c) _Treatment of Company PSU Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
then outstanding performance-based stock unit award (other than any such
award covered by _Section_ __ _ 4.3(b)_) (a " _Company PSU Award_ ") granted
under the Stock Plans shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into an award
(each, a " _Converted PSU Award_ ") representing the right to receive (without
interest and less applicable withholding taxes), an amount in cash equal to
(i) the number of Shares subject to such Company PSU Award determined in
accordance with the immediately following sentence by the compensation
committee of the Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ "),
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Merger Consideration. For purposes of the immediately
preceding sentence, the number of Shares subject to such Company PSU Award
shall be determined, (1) for any Company PSU Award with a performance period
commencing as of January 1, 2016, based on actual performance, as determined
by the Compensation Committee as set forth on Section 4.3 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and (2) for any Company PSU Award with a performance
period commencing as of January 1, 2017, based on performance deemed satisfied
at the target level. Each Converted PSU Award will be subject to the same
terms and conditions (including payment timing, forfeiture, vesting
and acceleration provisions) that were applicable to the related Company PSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that as of the

the Company Reports filed by the Company with the SEC since December 31, 2015
and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding, in each
case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor or "forward-looking
statements" section or any similar section to the extent they are cautionary,
predictive or forward-looking nature) or in the correspondingly numbered
sections or subsections of the disclosure schedule delivered to Parent and
Merger Sub by the Company immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that

Effect or (ii) prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of

(ii) prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has made
available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement true, correct and

expressly excluded by other clauses of this definition, has resulted in a
Material Adverse Effect;

(M) the identity of Parent or Merger Sub; or 

(N) the existence of and compliance by the Company with the Non-Prosecution

 _provided_ , _further_ , that, the exceptions in clauses (A) through (F) will

(iii) otherwise facilitate knowingly any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ to the contrary, prior
to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, in
response to an _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal received after the
date of this Agreement that did not result from a material breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_, the Company may, or may authorize its Representatives
to, (A) provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person who
has made a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
material breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ if the Company receives from
the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms not less restrictive to the other party than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 1, 2017, by
and between a Subsidiary of Parent and the Company, as amended by the Addendum
to Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of October 22, 2017 (as further
amended, supplemented or modified from time to time in accordance with its
terms, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , that such
confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making, or amendment, of an
Acquisition Proposal privately to the Company Board; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company shall not enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent
to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or
otherwise prohibits the Company from complying with its obligations under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) disclose 

 



-41-  (and, if applicable, provide copies of) any such information to Parent to
the extent not previously disclosed or provided to Parent; (B) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made
such a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a

with  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_, authorize, adopt, approve, recommend, or
otherwise declare advisable or propose to authorize, adopt, approve, recommend
or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if
and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any action described in
clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, (y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the Company
Board has determined in good faith based on the information then available
and after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel
that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (z) in the case
referred to in clause (C) above, the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

 

(c) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer with respect to (i) a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, spin-off,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or assets, in each case, representing 15% or more of the
consolidated net revenues, net income or total assets (including equity
securities of its Subsidiaries or any other entity) of the Company; (ii) any
direct or indirect acquisition by any Person or group resulting in, or
proposal or offer, which if consummated would result in, any Person or group
becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of
related transactions, of 15% or more of the total voting power or of any
class of equity securities of the Company, or those of any of its Subsidiaries
or assets, in each case, representing 15% or more of the consolidated net
revenues, net income or total assets (including equity securities of its
Subsidiaries or any other entity) of the Company or (iii) any combination of
the foregoing, in each case, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ and that
would result in any Person or group becoming the beneficial owner of, directly
or indirectly, more than 80% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more
than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company
that the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and its outside financial advisor, taking into
account all legal, financial, financing, regulatory and other aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person(s) making the proposal and
the likelihood of the proposal being consummated in accordance with its terms
and all other matters that the Company Board considers appropriate, that
would, if consummated, result in a transaction

 



-42-  (A) more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of
view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into
account any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_) and (B) that is reasonably likely to be
completed, taking into account any regulatory, financing or approval
requirements and any other aspects considered relevant by the Company Board.

(d) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except
as permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_, the Company Board, including any
committee thereof, shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (in a manner adverse to Parent) (or
publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (in a
manner adverse to Parent)) the Company Recommendation;

 

(ii) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable, any Acquisition
Proposal;

 

(iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;

 

(iv) in the event an Acquisition Proposal has been made public, fail to
publicly reaffirm its approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the
Merger within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of any written request to
do so from Parent (provided, that Parent shall only be entitled to request one
such reaffirmation per Acquisition Proposal; provided, further, that if
an Acquisition Proposal is modified in any material respect, Parent shall be
entitled to request one additional such reaffirmation in connection with each
such modification);

 

(v) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or
exchange offer prior to the close of business on the tenth (10th) business
day (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1 under the Exchange Act) after
commencement thereof; or

 

(vi) approve or recommend, or declare advisable or propose to enter into, or
cause or permit the Company to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or similar definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by  _Section_ __ _
6.2(b)_ relating to any Acquisition Proposal) (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ," and any of the actions set forth in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (vi), a " _Change of Recommendation_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the
Company Board may, after complying with the applicable provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_, effect a Change of Recommendation and, in the case of
a Change of Recommendation relating to a Superior Proposal, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_, in each case if the Company
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisor and 

 



-43-  outside legal counsel, that (x) in the case where the Change of
Recommendation is not made in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and the Company Board has provided
Parent with at least ninety-six (96) hours prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action, and (y) in
the case where such Change of Recommendation is made in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company Board shall not effect a Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or take any action pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.1(h)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal unless and until (1) the
Company notifies Parent in writing, at least ninety-six (96) hours in advance,
that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a
Superior Proposal or to take action pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ with
respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the identity of
the party who made such Superior Proposal and all of the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and include copies of any proposed
transaction documents; (2) after providing such notice and prior to making
such Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or taking
any action pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ with respect to a Superior
Proposal, the Company negotiates in good faith with Parent during such
ninety-six (96) hour period (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate)
to enable Parent to propose in writing such revisions to the terms of
this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to effect a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or to take such action
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ in response to a Superior Proposal;
and (3) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its outside financial
advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal even if such changes proposed in writing by Parent were to be given
effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not effect a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or take any action
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal prior
to the time that is ninety-six (96) hours after it has provided the written
notice required by clause (1) of the preceding sentence; _provided_ , that in
the event that the Acquisition Proposal is thereafter modified by the party
making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide written notice of
such modified Acquisition Proposal and shall again comply with this _Section_
__ _ 6.2(e)_, except that the deadline for such new written notice shall be
reduced to forty-eight (48) hours (rather than the ninety-six (96) hours
otherwise contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_) and the time the
Company shall be permitted to effect a Change of Recommendation in connection
with a Superior Proposal or to take action pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(h)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal shall be reduced to the time that
is forty-eight (48) hours after it has provided such written notice (rather
than the time that is ninety-six (96) hours otherwise contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_).

 

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _
6.2_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company, the Company Board, or any
committee thereof, from disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, or
from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder; it being understood that in no event shall this _Section_
__ _ 6.2(f)_ 

 



-44-  affect or alter the obligations specified in Section _ 6.2(d)_ or _6.2(e)_
(or the consequences thereof in accordance with this Agreement) or the
definition of Change of Recommendation.

(g) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will, and shall direct
its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or proposal or inquiry
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall promptly request any Person that has executed a confidentiality
or non-disclosure agreement in connection with any actual or potential
Acquisition Proposal that remains in effect as of the date of this Agreement
to return or destroy all confidential information provided pursuant to or in
connection with such agreement. Unless the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective officers and directors not to, waive,
terminate, modify or fail to enforce any "standstill" or confidentiality or
similar obligation of any Person (other than any party hereto or its
Affiliates) with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(h) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent in writing if any proposals,
indications of interest or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are
received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of
its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the material
terms and conditions of any proposal, indication of interest or offer
(including the identity of the party making such proposal, indication of
interest or offer and, if applicable, copies of any written request,
proposal, offer, indication of interest or offer, including proposed
agreements and any other written communications) and thereafter shall keep
Parent informed, on a prompt basis (and, in any event, within forty-eight
(48) hours), of the status and terms of any such proposal, inquiry, indication
of interest or offer (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any
such discussions or negotiations.

 

6.3. _Proxy Statement Filing; Information Supplied_. The Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement, a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the
Company Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment or
supplement thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company shall promptly
notify Parent of the receipt of all comments from the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent
copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any of its
Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC
with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement from the SEC,
and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of the Company as promptly as possible after the date the SEC
staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement. The Company agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules

 



-45-  and regulations thereunder. Parent and the Company each agree that none of
the information supplied by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at
the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Company shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Proxy Statement
and any other documents related to the Company Stockholders Meeting prior to
filing such documents with the applicable Governmental Authority and mailing
such documents to the Companys stockholders. The Company shall consider in
good faith all comments reasonably proposed by Parent or its legal counsel on
the Proxy Statement and such other documents related to the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

6.4. _Company_ _Stockholders_ _Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance
with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all
action necessary to convene a meeting of the holders of Shares (the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable after
clearance by the SEC staff of the Proxy Statement, to consider and vote upon
the approval of this Agreement and to cause such vote to be taken, and shall
not postpone or adjourn such meeting, except to the extent advised by counsel
to be necessary to comply with Law or pursuant to the following sentence.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Company
may (no more than two (2) times), and at Parents request (no more than two
(2) times) shall, adjourn, recess, or postpone the Company Stockholders
Meeting for a reasonable period to solicit additional proxies, if the Company
or Parent, respectively, reasonably believes there will be insufficient Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting or to obtain the
Requisite Company Vote and (ii) the Company may, and at Parents request
shall, adjourn, recess, or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting;
_provided_ _that_ , in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
unless agreed in writing by the Company and Parent, all such adjournments,
recesses or postponements shall be for periods of no more than ten Business
Days each. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_, the Company Board shall include
the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Requisite Company Vote. The Company agrees to
provide Parent reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy
solicitation results on a timely basis (including, if requested, providing
daily voting reports).

practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted or communication made to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy Statement). In addition,
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any
applicable Law each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of
the other parties to be present at each meeting, conference or telephone call
and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority in
connection with such request or proceeding. In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information 

 



-47-  contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent, as the
case may be); provided that materials provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.5_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual obligations, and (iii)
as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

 

(c) Subject to applicable Laws and as required by any Governmental Authority,
the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any
of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Laws, or the DOJ Agreement, or if any lawsuit or other
proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted), including any proceeding by any Governmental Authority or
private party, challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any Antitrust Law or the DOJ Agreement or which would otherwise
prohibit or materially impair or delay in connection with any Antitrust Law or
the DOJ Agreement the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to) use their respective reasonable best efforts to
(i) resolve any such objections and (ii) contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction, or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that results from such action or proceeding and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transaction on or before
the Outside Date. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall (and if (and
only if) requested by Parent, the Company shall) take all such further action
as may be necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Law or the DOJ Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date),
including proposing, negotiating, committing and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, to (i) sell, divest, dispose of or
otherwise hold separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), any
of the businesses, assets or properties of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries and (ii) otherwise take or
commit to take actions that after the Closing would limit Parents freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to operate and/or retain any of the
businesses, assets or properties of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, the Company, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, to become subject to, or consent or agree to
or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order to sell, divest, license, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets, operations or business of Parent, the Company, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, unless such requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order is binding on or otherwise applicable

 



-48-  to Parent or the Company only from and after the Effective Time in the event
that the Closing occurs.

shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested, _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation
or warranty made by the Company herein, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company
would violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the
Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such
third party to such inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any
privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
that in the event the Company does not disclose certain information pursuant
to the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), at Parents reasonable request the
parties shall implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit
the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the
non-disclosure to the greatest extent reasonably possible, including by
arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction of text from
documents or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to
any information to be so provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and
its Representatives shall not be permitted to perform any on-site procedures
(including an on-site study) with respect to any property of the Company or
its Subsidiaries without the Companys prior written consent, such consent not
to be unreasonably delayed, withheld or conditioned. All requests for
information made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be directed to
the executive

 



-49-  officer or other Person designated by the Company. All information exchanged
or made available shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties
hereby agree and acknowledge that the standstill and similar restrictions in
the Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply upon the execution and delivery
of this Agreement to the extent required to permit any action contemplated
hereby and in accordance herewith and solely until any valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

(c) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties
understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to
such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that
the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
other applicable privilege. All such information that is entitled to
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under
these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.

6.7. _Stock Exchange Delisting_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and

Corporation of the Shares from NYSE and the deregistration of the Shares
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

6.8.  _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the Company
nor Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue any press
release or make any other public announcement or public statement (to the
extent not previously publicly disclosed or made in accordance with this
Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without consulting with each other and providing meaningful
opportunity for review and giving due consideration to reasonable comment by
the other party, except (a) as such press release or other public announcement
may be required by applicable Law, in which case the party required to issue
the release or make the announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on such release or announcement in advance of its issuance and shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments proposed by the
other party or (b) in connection with a Change of Recommendation, actual or
potential Acquisition Proposal or dispute regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_, each of the parties may make public statements in
response to questions by the press, analysts, investors, business partners or
those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls,
so long as any such statements are consistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the
Company.

 



-50- 6.9. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continue to be employed after the Effective Time (other than those employees
covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
will, as long as they are employed, be provided with (i) during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, (A) a base salary or base wage that is no less favorable than
the base salary or base wage provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(B) other compensation and employee benefits (excluding equity-based and other
long-term incentive compensation, short-term incentive compensation, and
severance) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by
the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2018, target annual cash bonus
opportunities that are no less favorable than the target annual cash bonus
opportunities provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the second
anniversary of the Effective Time, severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits specified in Section 6.9(a)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b) Parent shall cause (or, with respect to employees outside of the United
States, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause) (i) any pre-existing
conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group
health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to the
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) the amount of
eligible expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible
dependents that were credited to deductible and maximum out-of-pocket co-
insurance requirements under the Benefit Plans to be credited for purposes of
satisfying the deductible and maximum out-of-pocket co-insurance requirements
under the corresponding benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates and (iii)
any of its (or its Affiliates) employee benefit plans (including disability
pay continuation plans) in which the Continuing Employees are entitled to
participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual thereunder (except for benefit accrual under defined benefit
pension plans, for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement
benefits or retiree medical benefits or to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits), service by such Continuing Employees to the Company
or any of its Affiliates or predecessors as if such service were with Parent,
to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable Benefit Plan.

 

(c) The Company shall be permitted to finally and conclusively determine the
amounts payable under the Companys annual bonus plans (collectively, the "
_Company_ ___Bonus Plans_ ") in respect of the 2017 fiscal year, and shall pay
such amounts in the ordinary course of business at such time annual bonuses
have historically been paid by the Company, but no later than the Closing
Date; _provided_ , that such amounts shall not, in the aggregate, exceed 110%
of the aggregate target bonus amounts under the Company Bonus Plans in respect
of the 2017 fiscal year.

 



-51- (d) The Company may, in consultation with Parent and subject to Parents
consent, establish bonus targets, maximums, performance measures and
eligibility and participation requirements under the Company Bonus Plans for a
performance period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on June 30, 2018
(the " _Short Performance Year_ "). Prior to Closing, Parent shall consult
with the Compensation Committee regarding the performance determination for
the Short Performance Year, based on results through the most recent
practicable date prior to the Closing, and Parent shall consider such views
in good faith upon making its determination in accordance with the following
sentence. Following the Closing, Parent shall determine the level of
achievement of the applicable performance measures for the Short Performance
Year and the earned bonus amount of each participant based on such level of
achievement, which amount shall be paid in the first calendar quarter of 2019,
subject to the participants continued employment with the Parent and
its Subsidiaries, including the Company, through such date. For the period
from July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, bonus opportunities will be
provided to Continuing Employees in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
6.9(a)(ii)_. In the event that, prior to payment of the 2018 fiscal year
bonuses, a Continuing Employees employment is terminated by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates without "cause"
or by such Continuing Employee for "good reason" (as each such term is defined
in the Company 2015 Stock Incentive Plan), such employee shall, no later than
thirty (30) days following such termination, be paid a bonus award for the
2018 fiscal year under the applicable Company Bonus Plan, based on target
performance levels and prorated for the portion of the 2018 fiscal year (based
on calendar days) elapsed between January 1, 2018 and the effective date of
such Continuing Employees termination of employment; _provided_ , that any
Continuing Employee who is otherwise entitled to receive a prorated bonus for
such period under a change in control agreement, severance plan,
or otherwise, will not be eligible to receive the prorated bonus described in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.9(d)_ in order to avoid duplication of benefits.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, each outstanding long-term incentive cash award
that was granted prior to the date of this Agreement shall vest in full and
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay such amounts to
the holders thereof through the Surviving Corporations payroll no later than
five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date.

 

(f) Parent hereby acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall constitute a "change in control," "change of control" or term
or concept of similar import of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the
terms of the Benefit Plans. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, honor all obligations and rights under the
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect from time to time,
including with respect to modification, amendment and termination.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement will
(i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or
terminating any of their benefit plans or, after the Effective Time, any
Benefit Plan, in each case, in accordance with their terms, (iii)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to
retain the employment of any particular employee or (iv) create any third
party beneficiary rights for the benefit of any employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective
bargaining representative thereof, with respect to this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_
or

 



-52-  any compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that
may be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan that Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

6.10. _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution
and performance of this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees and expenses of its
Representatives, shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except
that expenses incurred in connection with the filing fee for the Proxy
Statement and printing and mailing the Proxy Statement shall be shared equally
by Parent and the Company.

6.11. _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent shall also advance expenses
as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_
that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification), each present and former director and officer of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and each individual who was serving at the
request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee,
member, trustee or fiduciary of any other corporation, partnership or joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to (x) their service as such or (y) services
performed by such Indemnified Parties at the request of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, in each case at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including (i)
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
actions to enforce this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ or any other indemnification
or advancement right of any Indemnified Party.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation or
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the Indemnified Parties
or any of their predecessors and the heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries
and administrators of such Indemnified Parties, as provided in the Companys
or each of its Subsidiaries respective certificates of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents) or in any
Contract that has been made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement, shall survive the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
fulfill and honor such obligations to the maximum extent that the Company or
applicable Subsidiary would have been permitted to fulfill and honor them by
applicable Law. In addition, for six (6) years following the Effective

 



-53-  Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to cause the certificates
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions
with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at least as
favorable as the indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for six (6) years following the Effective Time in any
respect, except as required by applicable Law.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for
the extension of (i) the directors and officers liability coverage of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and (ii) the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a
claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after
the Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") from one or more insurance
carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Companys insurance
carrier as of the date of this Agreement (or, if no such policies are
available insurances carriers with such credit rating, from insurance
carriers with the next-highest credit rating then capable of providing such
policies) with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable,
in the aggregate, to the insureds as the Companys existing policies with
respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement,
act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him
or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for the Tail
Period the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable, in the aggregate, to the insureds as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for the Tail Period with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable, in the
aggregate, to the insureds as provided in the Companys existing policies as
of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent or
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to
this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premiums paid by the Company as of the date of this Agreement for such
insurance (or to pay an aggregate amount exceeding 300% of such annual
premiums to purchase the "tail" insurance policies contemplated for the first
sentence of this paragraph); and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage (or amount in respect of such "tail"
insurance policies, as applicable) exceeds such applicable amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall survive the Closing
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, and nothing in this

 



-54-  Agreement shall affect, and the rights of each Indemnified Party under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall be in addition to, any indemnification rights that
any such Indemnified Party may have under the certificates of incorporation
or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Contract or
applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without
the consent of such Indemnified Party.

 

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their
respective successors or assigns) shall consolidate or merge with any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger, or transfers at least 50% of its properties and
assets to any other Person, then in each case proper provision shall be made
so that the continuing or surviving corporation or entity (or its successors
or assigns, if applicable), or transferee of such assets, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_.

 

6.12. _Stockholder Litigation_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
notify the other of any stockholder litigation against it or any of its
Representatives arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep the other
reasonably informed regarding any such stockholder litigation. Until
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the
Company shall permit Parent to participate in any such stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors, including an opportunity to review
and to propose comments to all filings or written responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any stockholder litigation against the Company and
its directors relating to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments proposed by Parent. In no event shall the Company enter into, agree
to or disclose any settlement with respect to such stockholder litigation
without Parents consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other
promptly of the commencement of any stockholder litigation of which it has
received notice.

 

6.13. _DOJ Agreement_. As of and following the Effective Time and until the
expiration of the term of such agreement, Parent acknowledges and agrees that
the Surviving Corporation shall be bound to the obligations imposed upon the
Company pursuant to the DOJ Agreement. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the

occurrence of the Effective Time, applicable in full force to the Surviving
Corporation. As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,

Subsidiaries.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any breach by the Company or
its Subsidiaries of their obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ shall
not, in and of itself, constitute a breach for purposes of _Section_ __ _
8.1(e)_ or a breach of the condition precedent set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.2(b)_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_, Parent
and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of financing by
Parent or Merger Sub is not a condition to the Closing, and reaffirm their
respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of any financing, subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_
and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_.

(a) If requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (i) issue a notice of optional redemption on the Closing
Date for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Companys
5.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the " _Senior Notes_ "), issued pursuant to that
certain Indenture, dated as of September 25, 2012, among the Company, certain
of its subsidiaries party thereto as guarantors, and U.S. Bank National

the Closing Date specified by Parent and (ii) provide any other cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate, if elected by Parent, the
satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes pursuant to the Senior
Notes Indenture effective as of (or at Parents election, following) the
Closing Date. The redemption and (if applicable) satisfaction and discharge of
the Senior Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to
collectively as the " _Discharge_ " of the Senior Notes. Parent shall deposit
or cause to be deposited funds with the trustee for the Senior Notes
sufficient to fund any such Discharge no later than the earlier of the
redemption time specified in the applicable redemption notice and the date of
such satisfaction and discharge.

(b) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (i) deliver all
notices and take all other actions required to repay in full on the Closing
Date (using funds provided on the Closing Date by Parent) or in the case of
letters of credit, to cash collateralize (to 

 



-57-  the extent that Parent has not entered into alternative arrangements with
the issuing bank), all obligations then outstanding under the Second Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 22, 2017, among the Company,
certain subsidiaries of the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
administrative agent, and the other lenders and financial institutions party
thereto (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the " _Company
Credit Agreement_ ") and terminate the Company Credit Agreement (and the
Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations thereunder (other than those
obligations that survive the termination of the Company Credit Agreement in
accordance with the terms of the Company Credit Agreement as in effect as of
the date hereof or as customary in a payoff letter)) on the Closing Date and
(ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause the release on the Closing Date
of all Liens securing obligations under the Company Credit Agreement (such
repayment, release and termination, the " _Company Credit Agreement
Termination_ "), including using reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent,
on the Closing Date, a customary payoff letter, fully executed by the
relevant agent for the lenders and secured parties under the Company Credit
Agreement, evidencing and effecting the Company Credit Agreement Termination.

 

(c) Within the time periods required by the terms of each agreement governing
the Company Credit Agreement, the Senior Notes and the Subordinated
Convertible Notes (the " _Specified Company Indebtedness_ "), the Company
shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to take all actions required by the
terms of such agreement to be performed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time as a result of the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the giving of any notices that may
be required prior to the Effective Time and the delivery to the applicable
lender, agent, trustee, other counterparty or other applicable Person of any
documents or instruments required to be delivered to them prior to the
Effective Time, in each case in connection with such transactions or
otherwise required pursuant to any agreement governing the terms of any
Specified Company Indebtedness; provided that the Company shall deliver a copy
of any such notice or other document or instrument to Parent at least
three (3) Business Days prior to delivering or entering into such notice or
other document or instrument in accordance with the terms of the applicable
agreement governing the terms of such Specified Company Indebtedness. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon Parents written request, the
Company shall to (A) (i) execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and
delivered, as applicable) at the Effective Time, a supplemental indenture,
officers certificate and opinion of counsel, in each case in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, as may be required with respect to
the Senior Notes Indenture and the Subordinated Convertible Notes Indenture
and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause the trustees under the Senior
Notes Indenture and the Subordinated Convertible Notes Indenture to execute at
the Effective Time such supplemental indentures and (B) with respect to the
Loan Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2001, between the Industrial
Development Board of the City of Jackson and the Company (the " _Jackson Loan
Agreement_ "), use reasonable best efforts to cause " _Bond Counsel_ " (as
such term is used therein) to deliver the opinion contemplated by Section
5.7(c) thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that
the Bond Counsel opinion may not be delivered and the failure to deliver the
Bond Counsel opinion or a default or event of default under the Jackson Loan
Agreement shall not, in and of itself, constitute a breach of this Agreement
in any respect (it being understood and agreed that the underlying causes of
such failure may constitute a breach of this Agreement).

 



-58- (d) In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, take any actions and deliver
any documents, certificates, agreements or instruments that are reasonably
requested by Parent with respect to the repayment, repurchase, redemption,
retirement, termination, defeasance, discharge, satisfaction, assumption,
continuation, amendment or other treatment specified by Parent of any
Indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company other than the Specified
Company Indebtedness.

 

(e) Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including without limitation professional fees and expenses of accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors) to the extent such costs are incurred by
the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with cooperation provided by the
Company, its Subsidiaries, their respective officers, employees and other
Representatives pursuant to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ or this
_Section_ __ _ 6.17_. Parent hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the

and Representatives (collectively, the " _Financing Indemnitees_ ") from and

suffered or incurred by them in connection with any debt offers, Discharge or
other actions required to be taken pursuant to the terms of  _Section_ __ _
6.16_ or this _Section_ __ _ 6.17_, except to the extent that such
liabilities, damages, claims, costs, expenses or losses arose out of or result
from the gross negligence, bad faith, intentional breach or willful
misconduct of a Financing Indemnitee. This _Section_ __ _ 6.17(e)_ shall
survive the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.17_,
(A) the requested cooperation under  _Section_ __ _ 6.17(d)_ shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business or the ongoing operations of the
Company and/or the its Subsidiaries (B) nothing in _Section_ __ _ 6.17(d)_
shall (i) require cooperation to the extent that it would reasonably be
expected to conflict with or violate any applicable Law or result in a breach
of, or a default under, any contract, in each case material to the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives to breach,
waive or amend any terms of this Agreement, (iii) cause any condition to the

the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to violate any obligation of
confidentiality binding on the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, (C) neither
the Company nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or
incur any commitment or other similar fee or incur or assume any other actual
or potential liability or obligation in connection with any of the actions
required by  _Section_ __ _ 6.17(d)_, in each case other than as are
contingent upon the Closing or which are concurrently reimbursed by Parent,
(D) none of the directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, acting in
such capacity, shall be required to authorize or adopt any resolutions
approving the agreements, documents, instruments, actions and transactions
contemplated in connection with any cooperation requested under _Section_ __ _
6.17(d)_ that would be effective prior to the Effective Time, (E) none of the
Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers or
employees shall be required to execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any
agreement, document or instrument, including any definitive financing
agreement, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.17(d)_ that is not contingent upon
the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time (other than
notices of the transactions contemplated hereby that are required in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Indebtedness

 



-59-  for borrowed money to be delivered prior to Closing) and (F) none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
Representatives shall be required, prior to Closing, to make any
representation or warranty to any person in connection with any cooperation
requested pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.17(d)_ (other than in notices of the
transactions contemplated hereby or other documents that are required in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Indebtedness for borrowed money to
be delivered prior to Closing). Nothing in _Section_ __ _ 6.17(d)_ shall
require any employee, officer, director or Representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any
other action that would result in personal liability to such employee,
officer, director or Representative.

the second and third sentences of _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _willful and
material breach_ " means a material breach that is a consequence of an act
undertaken or a failure to take an act by or on behalf of the breaching party
with the knowledge that the taking of such act or the failure to take such
act would cause a material breach of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

Acquisition Proposal or shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(i)_, the references to "15%" in the

into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay Parent
any amount due pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ (any such amount due, a "
_Termination Payment_ "), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
applicable Termination Payment, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest thereon at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ (or if not reported therein, as reported in another authoritative
source reasonably selected by Parent) in effect on the date such Termination
Payment was required to be paid from such date through the date of full
payment thereof; _provided_ , that if such suit does not result in a judgment
against the Company, Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit.

 

(d) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination
Fee on more than one occasion. Except in the event of fraud or willful and
material breach, if a Termination Payment is required to be, and is, paid
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, Parents right to receive the
applicable Termination Payment and any additional amounts pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent and
its respective Subsidiaries and any of Parents or its Subsidiaries
respective former, current, or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates,
agents and other Representatives against the Company, the Companys
Subsidiaries and any of the

 



-64-  Companys or its Subsidiaries respective former, current, or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members,
Affiliates, agents or other Representatives for any loss suffered as a result
of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated.

 

(e) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Company
Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee is due and payable and
which do not involve fraud or willful and material breach, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities forgone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and, except in the event
of fraud or willful and material breach, such Company Termination Fee shall be
in full and complete satisfaction of any and all monetary damages of Parent,
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current, or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers,
members, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives arising out of or related
to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including any breach of this Agreement by the Company), the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any claims or actions
under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure;
(ii) in the event this Agreement is terminated under circumstances where the
Company Termination Fee is payable, and is paid, except in the event of fraud
or willful and material breach, in no event shall (x) Parent be entitled to
seek or obtain any recovery or judgment in excess of the Company Termination
Fee and any additional amounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_ against the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current, or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, managers, members, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives or
any of their respective assets, or (y) Parent be entitled to seek or obtain
any other damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or
punitive damages for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any breach by the Company), the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions
under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure;
and (iii) the parties shall take such actions as are necessary and sufficient
so that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ may be
enforceable against such party, including executing and delivering any
waivers, releases and similar instruments consistent therewith upon any other
partys request; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall
not limit the right of the parties hereto to specific performance of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_.

9.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an
original instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the
same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to
this Agreement by facsimile transmission or by email of a .pdf attachment
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

9.5. _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific Performance_. 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. In addition, each of the
parties (a) expressly submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the
courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of
America located in the State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), in
the event any dispute between the parties hereto (whether in contract, tort
or otherwise) arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (b) expressly waives any claim of lack of personal jurisdiction or
improper venue and any claims that such courts are an inconvenient forum with
respect to such a claim, and (c) agrees that it shall not bring any claim,
action or proceeding against any other parties

 



-66-  hereto relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in
any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each party hereby irrevocably consents
to the service of process of any of the aforementioned courts in any such
suit, action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or
certified mail or by overnight courier service, postage prepaid, to its
address set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.6_, such service to become effective
ten (10) days after such mailing. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM, ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (i) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (ii) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION 9.5_.

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that the
rights of each party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are special, unique and of extraordinary
character and that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached, immediate and irreparable harm or damage would be caused for which
money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees
that, in addition to any other available remedies a party may have in equity
or at law, each party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and to obtain an injunction restraining any
breach or violation or threatened breach or violation of the provisions of
this Agreement without necessity of posting a bond or other form of security.
In the event that any action or proceeding should be brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege or assert, and
each party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at
law.

9.6. _Notices_. All notices, requests, instructions or other communications or
documents to be given or made hereunder by any party to the other parties to
this Agreement shall be in writing and (a) served by personal delivery upon
the party for whom it is intended, (b) by an internationally recognized

with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



-68- 9.8. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in this  _Section_ __
_ 9.8_, Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to
the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does
not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein; _provided_ , that if, and only if, the Effective

the Effective Time occurs.

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 

9.10. _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _
4.2(c)(iv)_, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and

expressly shall not be a liability of holders of Shares. 

9.11. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex_ __ _ A_ is
defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 



-69- 9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

 

(b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall have
a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a verb).
Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words
importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral genders
and vice versa, and the definitions of terms contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. The
words "includes" or "including" shall mean "including without limitation," the
words "hereof," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and similar terms in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular
section or article in which such words appear, the word "extent" in the phrase
"to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends and such phrase shall not mean simply "if," any reference to a Law
shall include any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any
reference to any Law in this Agreement shall mean such Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented. Currency amounts referenced herein are
in U.S. Dollars. Each reference to a "wholly-owned Subsidiary" or "wholly-
owned Subsidiaries" of a Person shall be deemed to include any Subsidiary of
such Person where all of the equity interests of such Subsidiary are directly
or indirectly owned by such Person (other than directors qualifying shares,
nominee shares or other equity interests that are required by law or
regulation to be held by a director or nominee). The terms "provided to" or
"made available to," with respect to documents required to be provided by the
Company to Parent or Merger Sub, include documents filed or furnished by the
Company with the SEC.

(c) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

9.14. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
parties, except that Merger Sub may assign any and all of its rights under
this Agreement, by written notice to the Company, to another wholly-owned
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent to be a Constituent Corporation in
lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references to Merger Sub in this
Agreement shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all
representations and warranties made in this Agreement with respect to Merger
Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and
warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such
designation; _provided_ that (a) no

 



-70-  assignment shall be permitted if such assignment would, or would reasonably
be expected to, prevent or materially delay Parent from performing their
respective obligations under this Agreement or consummating the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) no assignment
shall relieve Parent of any of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

 _Form of Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_ AMENDED AND RESTATED

 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

of

GENERAL CABLE CORPORATION

ARTICLE I

The name of the corporation is General Cable Corporation (the " _Corporation_
").

ARTICLE II

 

The address, including street, number, city, and county, of the registered
office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is the Corporation Trust
Center, 1209 Orange Street, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State
of Delaware 19801; and the name of the registered agent of the Corporation in
the State of Delaware at such address is the Corporation Trust Company.

 

ARTICLE III

The purpose of the Corporation shall be to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized and incorporated under the
DGCL.

 

ARTICLE IV

Section 1\. The Corporation shall be authorized to issue 1,000 shares of
capital stock, all of which 1,000 shares shall be shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ ").

 

Section 2\. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Common Stock shall have
the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and for all
other purposes. Each share of the Common Stock shall have one vote and the
Common Stock shall vote together as a single class.

ARTICLE V 

Any one or more directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the vote
or written consent of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to be voted in the
election of directors.

ARTICLE VI

 

In furtherance and not in limitation of those powers conferred by law, the
board of directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ ") is
expressly authorized and empowered to make, alter and repeal the by-laws of
the Corporation (the " _By-Laws_ "). ARTICLE VII

 

Meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such place, within or without
the State of Delaware as may be designated by, or in the manner provided in,
the By-Laws or, if not so designated, at the registered office of the
Corporation in the State of Delaware. Elections of directors need not be by
written ballot unless and to the extent that the By-Laws so provide.

ARTICLE VIII

 

The Corporation reserves the right at any time from time to time to amend,
alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate
of Incorporation, and any other provisions authorized by the laws of the
State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted, in the manner
now or hereinafter prescribed by law, and all rights, preferences and
privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any
other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation
in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right
reserved in this Article.

 

ARTICLE IX

No person shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders
for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, including,
without limitation, directors serving on committees of the Board; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a
director (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the
Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith
or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii)
under Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for any transaction from which the
director derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended
hereafter to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting
the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by
