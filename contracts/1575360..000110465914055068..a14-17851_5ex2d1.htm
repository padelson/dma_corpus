Working Capital indicated thereon) and the Closing Cash Statement delivered by
Buyer to Seller shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties unless
Seller, within 20 days after delivery to Seller of the Closing Cash Statement,
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Statement, that, in each
case, complies with _Section 2.2.2_ notifies Buyer in writing that Seller
disputes any of the amounts set forth therein, specifying the nature of the
dispute and the basis therefor. During such 20 day period and the pendency of
any such disputes, (A) the Buyer and the Company will provide the Seller and
its Representatives with reasonable access to (x) any documents, schedules,
work papers or other information used in the preparation of the Closing Cash
Statement, Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Working Capital Statement and (y)
employees of the Company and Buyer responsible for the preparation of the
Closing Cash Statement, Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Working Capital
Statement and (B) the Seller will provide Buyer with reasonable access to any
documents, schedules, work papers or other information used in the preparation
of the Closing Cash Statement, Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Working
Capital Statement. The Parent Parties shall in good faith attempt to resolve
any such dispute and, if the Parent Parties so resolve all such disputes, the
Closing Cash Statement, Closing Balance Sheet and

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing Working Capital Statement (and the computation of Closing Working
Capital indicated thereon), as amended to the extent necessary to reflect the
resolution of such disputes and the agreement thereto of the Parent Parties,
shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. If the Parties do not reach an
agreement in resolving the dispute within 20 days after notice is given by
Seller to Buyer pursuant to the second preceding sentence, the Parties shall
submit the dispute to an internationally recognized accounting firm mutually
acceptable to Seller and Buyer (the " _Arbiter_ ") for resolution. As promptly
as reasonably practicable, but no later than 20 days after acceptance of its
appointment as Arbiter, the Arbiter shall determine (it being understood that
in making such determination, the Arbiter shall be functioning as an expert
and not as an arbitrator), based solely on written submissions by Buyer and
Seller, and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute and shall
render a written report as to the resolution of the dispute and the resulting
computation of the amount of Cash at the Closing and the Closing Working
Capital which shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. In resolving any
disputed item, the Arbiter (x) shall be bound by the provisions of this
_Section 2.2_ and (y) may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such items claimed by either Parent Party or less than the
smallest value for such items claimed by either Parent Party. The fees, costs
and expenses of the Arbiter (the " _Arbiter s Costs_") shall be allocated to
and borne by Buyer and Seller based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Arbiters determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of
the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the Arbiter. For
example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Arbiter
awards $600 in favor of Sellers position, 60% of the Arbiters Costs of its
review would be borne by Buyer and 40% of the Arbiters Costs would be borne
by Seller.

 



 

2.2.4 _Payment_. Upon final determination of Closing Working Capital and the
amount of Cash at the Closing as provided in _Section 2.2.3_ above, (A) if
the sum of the Closing Working Capital and the Cash at the Closing is greater
than the sum of the Estimated Closing Working Capital and the Estimated Cash,
Buyer shall as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than
five (5) Business Days after such final determination, pay the amount of such
difference to Seller and (B) if the sum of the Closing Working Capital and the
Cash at the Closing is less than the sum of the Estimated Closing Working
Capital and the Estimated Cash, Seller shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after such
final determination, pay to Buyer the amount of such difference, in each case,
such payments will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated by the Party receiving such payment. So long as such
amounts are paid in accordance with this _Section 2.2.4_, no interest shall
be payable on such amounts.

 



 

2.2.5 _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, Buyer
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable in
accordance with this Agreement such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and

 



      
 

 



 

withholding was made. Buyer will notify Seller in writing of any such
withholding at least five Business Days before the Closing Date. Buyer shall
use reasonable best efforts to request any appropriate Tax forms or similar
information from Seller in order to reduce or eliminate any such withholding.

and complete list of each Company Benefit Plan. " _Company Benefit Plan_ "
means each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee

Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and any other plan,
policy, program, practice, agreement, understanding or arrangement (whether
written or oral) providing compensation or other benefits to any current or
former director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (or to any dependent or beneficiary thereof), which is maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or under
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any actual or contingent
obligation or liability, including all incentive, bonus, deferred
compensation, cafeteria, medical, disability, severance, stock purchase or

3.10.4 Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter or
notification, advisory or opinion letter, as applicable, from the IRS as to
its qualified status, copies of which have been delivered to or made available
to Buyer, and, to Sellers knowledge, no fact or event has occurred that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Company Benefit Plan. There has been no prohibited transaction (within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, other than a
transaction that is exempt under a statutory or administrative exemption) with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan that would result in liability to the
Company. No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has
been brought, or to the knowledge of Seller, is threatened against or with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS
or United States Department of Labor (other than routine benefits claims).

Section 3(37) of ERISA). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA which has not been satisfied in

manner.

 



 

3.10.7 Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, alone or
in connection with any other event (including any termination of employment or
service), (A) result in any payment or benefit becoming due under any Company
Benefit Plan, (B) increase any payments or benefits otherwise payable under
any Company Benefit Plan, (C) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment or vesting of any payments or benefits under any Company Benefit Plan
to any extent, or (D) result in the forgiveness in whole or in part of any
outstanding loans made by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any person.

 



 

3.10.8 No amount that would be received from any Company Benefit Plan (whether
in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone
or together with any other event or circumstance) by any employee, officer or
director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code).

 



 

3.10.9 Except as required by Law, no Company Benefit Plan provides any post-
employment medical or life insurance benefits.

 



 

3.10.10 The Company and each applicable Company Subsidiary has reserved all
rights necessary to amend or terminate each of the Company Benefit Plans that
provide health and/or welfare benefits without the consent of any other person
or entity and without any liability other than for benefit claims owed with
respect to the period prior to the date of termination.

plan subject to Section 409A of the Code has been maintained, operated and
administered in good faith compliance under published guidance under Section
409A of the Code in terms of both operation and documentation. No Company
Benefit Plan provides any individual with an indemnity, a "gross up" or any
similar payment or right in respect of any Taxes that may become payable under
Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

or together with any other event or circumstance) by any employee, officer or

or similar agreement or arrangement to which Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary is
a party, and subject to applicable Law, from the date of this Agreement to the

Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof and (B) furnish as promptly
as reasonably practicable such information concerning the business,
properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of
Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries as Seller or the Seller Representatives may
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access shall be
conducted at a reasonable time, upon reasonable advance notice to Buyer and in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of any
business conducted by Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Buyer shall not be required to (or to cause any Buyer Subsidiary to) so
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that doing so
would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege or require disclosure of
any Buyer Consolidated Tax Return.

 



 

5.6.3 The Company shall provide Buyer with the periodic reports set forth in
_Section 5.6.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 **Section 5.7** ** ****_Acquisition Proposals._**

 



 

5.7.1 Subject to _Sections 5.7.2_ and _5.7.4_ , Buyer agrees that it shall
not, nor shall it permit or authorize any Buyer Subsidiaries or any of its or
their directors or officers to, and shall not authorize or permit any other
Buyer Representative to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each Buyer Representative not to, directly or indirectly, take any action to
(A) solicit, initiate or encourage any Buyer Acquisition Proposal, (B)
participate in any way in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any
non-public information to, any person with respect to a Buyer Acquisition
Proposal other

 



      
 

 



 

than the transactions contemplated hereby, (C) withhold, withdraw (or not
continue to make), qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), qualify or modify) the Buyer
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Seller, (D) other than the transactions
contemplated hereby, approve, recommend or take any public position (including
any position communicated to Buyers stockholders or any other person, but not
including communications made in internal discussions among Buyers management
and its advisors) other than "against" any Buyer Acquisition Proposal, or (E)
enter into any agreement or letter of intent with respect to any Buyer
Acquisition Proposal. Buyer has previously ceased and caused to be terminated
any negotiations with any person (other than the Company and Seller) conducted
theretofore by Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries or any Buyer Representative with
respect to any Buyer Acquisition Proposal, and shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable request that the other parties thereto, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, return or destroy, subject to the terms of any agreement with
such parties, any confidential information previously furnished by Buyer, the
Buyer Subsidiaries or the Buyer Representatives thereunder.

 



 

5.7.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.7.1_,
Buyer or the Buyer Board, as applicable, shall be permitted to:

 



 

5.7.2.1 take and disclose to Buyers stockholders a position with respect to
any tender or exchange offer by a third party or amend or withdraw such a
position complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act in a manner consistent with its other obligations under this
_Section 5.7_; _provided_ that this _Section 5.7.2.1_ shall not be deemed to
permit the Buyer Board to make a Buyer Adverse Recommendation Change or take
any actions referred to in _Section 5.7.4_, except to the extent permitted by
_Section 5.7.4_; or

 



 

5.7.2.2 at any time prior to obtaining the Buyer Stockholder Approval,
negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with, and furnish nonpublic
information to, any person in response to an unsolicited written Buyer
Acquisition Proposal by such person, if (A) the Buyer Board determines in good
faith after consultation with and advice from its financial advisor, that such
proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Buyer Superior Proposal, (B) such
person executes a confidentiality agreement no less favorable to Buyer than
the letter agreement, dated as of February 19, 2014, entered into by Seller
and Buyer (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (C) the Buyer
Board determines in good faith after consultation with Buyers outside legal
counsel that the failure to engage in such negotiation or discussions or
provide such information would violate Buyer Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 



 

5.7.3 Buyer shall (A) notify Seller orally and in writing of the receipt of
any Buyer Acquisition Proposal or any Buyer Acquisition Proposal (including
the material terms thereof and the identity of the person making it) as
promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no case later than 48 hours after
its receipt), (B) as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no case later
than 48 hours after its receipt) inform Seller regarding any material changes
to the status, terms and details (including amendments or proposed amendments)
of such Buyer Acquisition Proposal, (C) deliver

 



      
 

 



 

to Seller concurrently with the delivery to such person or its representatives
a copy of any non-public information as permitted by _Section 5.7.2_ which
has not previously been delivered by Buyer to Seller and (D) keep Seller
promptly advised of all changes to the material terms of any Buyer Acquisition
Proposal. Buyer shall (A) notify Seller in writing of the occurrence of any
Intervening Event (including a description thereof) as promptly as reasonably
practicable (but in no case later than 48 hours after having knowledge that
the relevant event or change in circumstances constitutes an Intervening
Event) and (B) as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no case later
than 48 hours after having knowledge thereof) inform Seller regarding any
material changes to the status and details of such Intervening Event.

 



 

5.7.4 Except as otherwise specifically permitted by this _Section 5.7.4_,
neither the Buyer Board nor any committee thereof shall (A) withdraw or
modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Seller, the Buyer Recommendation, or (B) approve, recommend or take a public
position with respect to, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or take a
public position with respect to, any Buyer Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and provided that Buyer has not breached this
_Section 5.7_, prior to the Buyer Stockholder Approval, the Buyer Board shall
be permitted to make a Buyer Adverse Recommendation Change, but only if (i)
(y) Buyer has received a proposal which the Buyer Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its financial advisor constitutes a Buyer
Superior Proposal and (z) the Buyer Board determines in good faith after
consultation with Buyers outside legal counsel that the failure to take such
action would violate the Buyer Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(this clause (i), a " _Superior Proposal BARC_ "); or (ii) an event has
occurred or is occurring which the Buyer Board determines in good faith (y)
after consultation with and advice from its financial advisor constitutes an
Intervening Event and (z) after consultation with Buyers outside legal
counsel that the failure to take such action would violate the Buyer Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (this clause (ii), an " _Intervening
Event BARC_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.7_ to the
contrary, Buyer shall not exercise its right to make a Buyer Adverse
Recommendation Change under this _Section 5.7.4_ unless (a) Buyer shall have
delivered to Seller a prior written notice (a " _Change Notice_ "), not less
than five (5) Business Days prior to the time such action is intended to be
taken, advising Seller that the Buyer Board intends to make a Buyer Adverse
Recommendation Change, specifying in reasonable detail (A) the material terms
of the Buyer Superior Proposal or (B) a description of the Intervening Event,
as applicable, (b) Buyer negotiates in good faith with Seller to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby as would enable the Buyer Board to determine that failing
to make a Buyer Adverse Recommendation Change would not violate the Buyer
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (c) on or before the fifth
(5th) Business Day following Sellers receipt of the Change Notice, and taking
into account in good faith any revised proposal made by Seller since receipt
of the Change Notice, such Buyer Superior Proposal remains a Buyer Superior
Proposal, or such Intervening Event remains in effect, as applicable, and the
Buyer Board has again made the determinations referred to above; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that any such Buyer Acquisition Proposal is
thereafter modified by the person making such Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal and the Buyer Board determines to make a Buyer Adverse
Recommendation Change due to such Buyer Acquisition Proposal as permitted by
this _Section 5.7.4_, Buyer shall again comply with clauses (a) and (b) of
this paragraph except that the five (5) Business Day period shall be reduced
to three (3) Business Days. Concurrently with making a Buyer Superior Proposal
BARC, Buyer may terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1.6_
and in connection therewith enter into an agreement with respect to such Buyer
Superior Proposal.

 



 

5.7.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the letter
agreement, dated as of February 19, 2014, entered into by Seller and Buyer,
upon any Buyer Adverse Recommendation Change, the restrictions and obligations
set forth in (A) Section 7 thereof (Standstill), (B) the second and third
sentences of Section 2(b) thereof (Agreements with Other Persons) and (C) the
proviso in Section 2(d) thereof (Sources of Financing) shall thereafter be
inoperative and of no force or effect.

 



 

 **Section 5.8** ** ****_Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings._**

 



 

5.8.1 Subject to _Section 5.7_, the Parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to (A) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any
applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable, (B) obtain from
Governmental Authorities any Governmental Authorizations required to be
obtained or made by any of the Parties or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, and avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Authority
(including those in connection with Antitrust Laws), in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated herein, (C) make or cause to be made the
applications or filings required to be made by any of the Parties or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, including Governmental Authorizations, under or
with respect to any Laws in connection with the authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein, and to pay any fees due from it in connection with such
applications or filings, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any
event within ten Business Days after the date hereof except as otherwise
provided herein, (D) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request
under or with respect to any such Laws for additional information, documents
or other materials received by any of the Parties or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Authority in connection with such

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (E) coordinate and cooperate
with, submit to the other Parties for review and give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the other Party in
connection with, making (i) any filing or application under or with respect to
any such Laws, (ii) the filings required by the HSR Act and (iii) any filings,
conferences or other submissions related to resolving any investigation or
other inquiry by any Governmental Authority. Each of Buyer, Seller and the
Company shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to, furnish to the
other Parties all information necessary for any such application or other
filings to be made in connection with the transactions

 



       
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Parties shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable inform the other Parties of any communication with, and
any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with any Governmental
Authority regarding any such application or filing. If a Party intends to
independently participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry, then such Party
shall give the other Parties reasonable prior notice of, and the opportunity
to participate in, such meeting. The Parties shall coordinate and cooperate
with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any Party in connection with all meetings, actions and
proceedings under or relating to any such application or filing.

 



 

5.8.2 The Parties shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party
consents necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties
shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Company
Material Contracts or Buyer Material Contracts in connection with consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers; _provided_ , _further_ , that except as
expressly provided in _Article 6_, no such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers shall constitute conditions to the Closing. In the event that any
Party shall fail to obtain any third party consent described in the first
sentence of this _Section 5.8.2_, such Party shall use reasonable best
efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by any of the
other Parties, to mitigate any adverse effect upon the Parties, their
respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which
could reasonably be expected to result after the Closing, from the failure to
obtain such consent; _provided_ , _however_ , with respect to the foregoing,
each Party shall be required to only undertake reasonable actions and shall
not be required to pay any amounts in connection therewith.

 



 

5.8.3 From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, each of the Parties
shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify the other Parties in
writing of any pending or, to the knowledge of such Party, threatened
Litigation (A) challenging or seeking material damages in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) seeking to restrain or
prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parties
shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under Antitrust Laws. In connection therewith,
if any Litigation is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
any transactions contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of any Law,
the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall cooperate, to contest
and resist any such Litigation, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

by this Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal unless, by mutual agreement, the Parties
decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests.

 



 

5.8.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement relating to
Antitrust Laws, neither Buyer, nor any of its Affiliates (which for purposes
of this sentence shall include the Company) shall be required, in connection
with the matters covered by this _Section 5.8_, (A) to pay any amounts (other
than the payment of filing fees and expenses and fees of counsel), (B) to hold
separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest any of their respective
businesses, product lines or assets, (C) to agree to any limitation on the
operation or conduct of Buyers or the Companys or any of their respective
Subsidiaries businesses or (D) to waive any of the conditions set forth in
_Article 7_ of this Agreement.

 



 

5.8.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement relating to
Antitrust Laws, neither Seller, nor any of its Affiliates (which for purposes
of this sentence shall include the Company for pre-Closing periods) shall be
required, in connection with the matters covered by this _Section 5.8_, (A)
to pay any amounts (other than the payment of filing fees and expenses and
fees of counsel), (B) to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or
divest any of their respective businesses, product lines or assets, (C) to
agree to any limitation on the operation or conduct of Sellers or the
Companys (for pre-Closing periods) or any of their respective Subsidiaries
businesses or (D) to waive any of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ of
this Agreement.

 



 

5.8.6 Each Party shall use reasonable best efforts to take such action as may
be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement.

 



 

5.8.7 No Party will take any action that would cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any
Takeover Law and each of them will take all necessary steps within its control
to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) those transactions from any
applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect.

 



 

 **Section 5.9** ** ****_Certain Notices._**

 



 

From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing, each Party shall
as promptly as reasonably practicable notify the other Parties of the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would reasonably be expected
to result in any condition to the obligations of any Party to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that a breach of this _Section
5.9_ shall not be considered for purposes of determining the satisfaction of
the closing conditions set forth in _Article 6_ or give rise to a right of
termination under _Article 7_ if the underlying breach or breaches

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to which the other Party failed to give notice would not result
in the failure of the closing conditions set forth in _Article 6_ or would
not result in the ability of such non-breaching Party to terminate this
Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.10** ** ****_Public Announcements._**

 



 

Buyer and Seller shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but no later
than the first Business Day following the date of this Agreement, with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, issue a mutually agreed
upon press release. In connection with press releases or public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer and
Seller shall coordinate and consult with each other before issuing, and give
each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, giving due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith, such press releases or public statements. Buyer and
Seller shall not issue any such press release (other than any press release by
Buyer to announce action taken by such person as permitted by, _Section 5.7_)
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law, court process, listing agreement or Nasdaq
marketplace rule; _provided_ that Buyer and Seller shall coordinate and
consult with respect to the timing, basis and scope of such disclosure
requirement.

 



 

 **Section 5.11** ** ****_Employee Benefit Matters._**

 



 

5.11.1 Buyer shall or shall cause the Company to, for a period of 12 months
immediately following the Closing Date, (A) provide each employee of the
Company and any Company Subsidiary employed immediately prior to the Closing
(" _Continuing Employees_ ") with employee benefit plans, programs, Contracts,
and arrangements (including, but not limited to, any profit sharing and/or
bonus programs) that are at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as the
employee benefit plans provided to other similarly situated employees of
Buyer, and (B) not reduce the base salary of such Continuing Employees as in
effect on the date hereof or that has been increased in accordance with
_Section 5.1_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, effective as of the Closing,
Buyer may establish new annual bonus policies to replace the Companys bonus
policies set forth on _Section 5.11.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules or
the successor bonus policy established by the Company in accordance with the
terms of _Section 5.1_. The Company shall pay annual bonuses for calendar
year 2014 to the Continuing Employees in a manner consistent with the terms of
the Companys bonus policy set forth on _Section 5.11.1_ of the Company

to the timing of such bonus payments) to the extent such Continuing Employees
are covered by such bonus policy on the date hereof.

carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing and at-work conditions,
if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to

year including the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Date by Buyer or one of its Affiliates to the extent such limitations or
conditions would have been satisfied or waived under the terms of the
comparable Company Benefit Plan prior to Closing, and (B) provide credit to
Continuing Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by such employees under the corresponding Company Benefit Plans
during the portion of the relevant plan year including the Closing Date.
Buyers obligation under clause (B) of this _Section 5.11.2_ shall be
contingent on Seller providing Buyer with information needed by Buyer to
fulfill its obligation under Clause (B).

 



 

5.11.3 Buyer shall cause the Company to honor all accrued but unused vacation
and compensatory time off of each Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the aggregate amount of vacation and compensatory time
off honored by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 5.11.3_ shall not exceed the
amount accrued in respect thereof on the Closing Balance Sheet.

 



 

5.11.4 Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to take all
actions necessary to terminate the Companys 2012 SAR Plan (the " _SAR Plan_

Section 4(e)(i) of the SAR Plan. Seller shall or shall cause the Company to
satisfy any outstanding obligations or liabilities under the SAR Plan,
including, but not limited to, paying the amount due, if any, to the holders
of each Company SAR under the termination provisions of the SAR Plan. Buyer
agrees that at all times from and after the Closing, the Committee (as defined

5.11.5 Prior to the Closing, Seller shall (A) cause the Company to take all
actions necessary under the Provide Commerce, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan
(the " _Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") to appoint individuals designated by

Deferred Compensation Plan) and Appeals Committee (as defined under the
Deferred Compensation Plan) so that the Committee and Appeals Committee are
comprised solely of the Appointed Members immediately after the Closing, (B)
cause the Company to take all actions necessary to transfer, prior to the
Closing, to the Deferred Compensation Plan trust the amount that is required
to be transferred to such trust pursuant to the Provide Commerce, Inc.
Deferred Compensation Plan Amended and Restated Rabbi Trust Agreement in
connection with the Closing or, if greater, such other amount to ensure that
such trust holds sufficient assets to pay each participant or beneficiary the
benefits to which they are entitled under the terms of the Deferred
Compensation Plan as of the Closing Date, and (C) cause the Company to take
all actions necessary under the Deferred Compensation Plan to cease all
participant and Company contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan,
effective as of the later of the Closing or the first date such cessation is
permissible under Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

5.11.6 Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, Buyer shall
recognize the service of Continuing Employees with Seller and the Company
prior to the Closing Date as service with Buyer and its Affiliates in

plans, deferred compensation plans, severance, vacation, sick leave and
holiday policies) maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates which is made
available following the Closing Date by Buyer and its Affiliates for purposes
of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement (but
excluding benefit accruals) to the extent such service was recognized under a
comparable Company Benefit Plan and to the extent such crediting of service
would not result in the duplication of benefits.

 



 

5.11.7 As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be accepted by the trustee
of a tax qualified retirement plan maintained by Buyer or one of its
Affiliates in which a Continuing Employee is eligible to participate (the "
_Buyer Retirement Plan_ ") a "direct rollover" pursuant to Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code of all or a portion of any eligible rollover distribution (within
the meaning of Section 402(c) of the Code) of each Continuing Employees
account balance (including participant loans) under the tax qualified
retirement plan maintained by Seller or one of its Affiliates (the " _Seller
Retirement Plan_ "), provided that Seller causes the Seller Retirement Plan to
provide to Buyer or one of its Affiliates the promissory notes and other loan
documentation, if any, of the Continuing Employees who have elected such a
direct rollover. The Buyer Retirement Plan shall accept the direct rollover of
electing Continuing Employees benefits in cash and, if applicable, promissory
notes from the Seller Retirement Plan; provided that any such direct rollover
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Seller Retirement Plan and
the Buyer Retirement Plan, in each case, as in effect from time to time
applicable to rollover contributions and participant loans.

 



 

5.11.8 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether
express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any employee benefit plan or arrangement, or shall limit the right of Buyer,
the Company or any of their Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify
any employee benefit plan or arrangement sponsored by Buyer, the Company or
any of their Affiliates following the Closing Date. In the event that (A) a
Party makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this
Agreement as an amendment to any employee benefit plan or arrangement
sponsored by Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates, and (B) such
provision is deemed to be an amendment to such plan or arrangement even though
not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then such provision shall
lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect. All provisions
contained in this _Section 5.11.8_ with respect to the Continuing Employees
are included for the sole benefit of Seller, and that nothing in this
Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third party
beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other person, including any employees,
former employees, any participant in any employee benefit plan, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Buyer,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

prior to the Closing with respect to the Company and/or the Company
Subsidiaries, and neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
shall have any further liability or rights thereunder.

 



 

5.12.2 Except for those powers of attorney set forth on _Section 5.12.2_ of

5.12.3.1 (A) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries (or any consolidated, combined, unitary or affiliated group of

be filed on or before the Closing Date (taking into account any applicable
extensions), or that are required to be filed after the Closing Date and are a
Seller Consolidated Tax Return; (B) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, all Tax Returns in respect of the Company and Company Subsidiaries
that relate to Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date but that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date (taking into account any

Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed,
any Tax Return required to be filed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
for any Straddle Period (the Tax Returns described in clauses (B) and (C) of
this sentence, the " _Buyer Prepared Tax Returns_ ").

 



 

5.12.3.2 With respect to any Buyer Prepared Tax Returns that are Income Tax
Returns (" _Buyer Prepared Income Tax Returns_ "), Buyer shall deliver to
Seller at least 15 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return
(taking into account any applicable extensions), copies of such Tax Return and
related work-papers and a statement setting forth the amount of Income Tax, if
any, that Seller owes pursuant to clause (A) of _Section 8.2.1.3_. Seller
shall have the right to review such Buyer Prepared Tax Return and related
work-papers and any liability for Income Taxes and to suggest to Buyer any
reasonable changes to such Tax Return no later than 10 days prior to the date
for the filing of such Tax Return. Seller and Buyer agree to consult and to
attempt to resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the review
of such Buyer Prepared Income Tax Return and related work-papers and
allocation of liability for Income Taxes and mutually to consent to the filing
as promptly as possible of such Tax Return. Not later than five days before
the due date for the payment of Taxes pursuant to any Buyer Prepared Income
Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions), Seller shall pay
to Buyer an amount equal to the Income Taxes as agreed to by Buyer and Seller
as being owed by Seller pursuant to clause (A) of _Section 8.2.1.3_ with
respect to such Tax Return.

 



 

5.12.3.3 With respect to any Buyer Prepared Tax Returns that are not Income
Tax Returns (" _Buyer Prepared Other Tax Returns_ "), Buyer shall deliver to
Seller as soon as practicable copies of such Buyer Prepared Other Tax Return
and

 



      
 

 



 

related work-papers and a statement setting forth the amount of non-Income
Tax, if any, that Seller owes pursuant to clause (A) of _Section 8.2.1.3_. If
Buyer cannot reasonably provide a draft of such Buyer Prepared Other Tax
Return to Seller prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, a copy of
such Buyer Prepared Other Tax Return, as filed, shall be provided to Seller as
soon as practicable following the filing date. Seller shall have the right to
review all Buyer Prepared Other Tax Returns and related work-papers and any
liability for non-Income Taxes and to suggest to Buyer any reasonable changes
to such Tax Returns within five days of Sellers receipt of each such Buyer
Prepared Other Tax Return. Seller and Buyer agree to consult and to attempt to
resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such
Buyer Prepared Other Tax Returns and related work-papers and allocation of
liability for non-Income Taxes and mutually to consent to the filing as
promptly as possible of such Tax Return (or, if a copy of such Buyer Prepared
Other Tax Return could not be provided to Seller prior to the filing of such
Tax Return, and Seller and Buyer agree upon any changes, to mutually consent
to the filing as promptly as possible of an amended Tax Return). Seller shall
pay to Buyer an amount equal to the non-Income Taxes as agreed to by Buyer and
Seller as being owed by Seller pursuant to clause (A) of _Section 8.2.1.3_
with respect to such Buyer Prepared Other Tax Return not later than the later
of (i) ten days after receiving from Buyer such Buyer Prepared Other Tax
Return, and (ii) five days before the due date for the payment of non-Income
Taxes pursuant to any Buyer Prepared Other Tax Return (taking into account any
applicable extensions).

 



 

5.12.3.4 If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on the amount of Taxes owed by
Seller with respect to any Buyer Prepared Tax Return, Seller shall pay to
Buyer the amount of Taxes reasonably determined using the mid-point of Buyers
and Sellers determination of the amount of Taxes to be owed by Seller in
respect of such Buyer Prepared Tax Return pursuant to clause (A) of _Section
8.2.1.3_. Within 10 days after such payment, Seller and Buyer shall refer the
matter to an independent nationally recognized accounting firm agreed to by
Buyer and Seller to arbitrate the dispute. Seller and Buyer shall equally
share the fees and expenses of such accounting firm and its determination as
to the amount owed by Seller pursuant to clause (A) of _Section 8.2.1.3_ with
respect to a Buyer Prepared Tax Return shall be binding on both parties.
Within five days after the determination by such accounting firm, if
necessary, the appropriate Parent Party shall pay the other Parent Party any
amount which is determined by such accounting firm to be owed.

 



 

5.12.4 _Use of Consistent Tax Practices_. To the extent that the items
reported on any Tax Return of or with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that is prepared by a Parent Party or its Affiliates is likely to
increase, by more than a _de minimis_ amount, any Tax liability of the other
Parent Party or its Affiliates or any Tax indemnity obligation under this
Agreement of the other Parent Party or its Affiliates, such Tax Return shall
be prepared in accordance with Tax accounting and other practices used by the
Company or such Company Subsidiary or Seller with respect to the relevant Tax
Returns filed prior to the date hereof (unless such past practices are not
permissible under applicable Law or Buyer concludes in good faith, after
consultation with Tax counsel, that such position cannot satisfy a more likely
than

 



      
 

 



 

not standard), and to the extent any items are not covered by past practices
(or in the event such past practices are not permissible under applicable Law
or Buyer concludes in good faith, after consultation with Tax counsel, that
such position cannot satisfy a more likely than not standard), in accordance
with reasonable practices selected by the Parent Party (or its Affiliate)
responsible for filing such Tax Return hereunder with the consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, of the other Parent Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Parties cannot agree on such practices,
the arbitration mechanism set forth in _Section 5.12.3_ shall apply. Unless
otherwise required by applicable Law, neither Parent Party nor any of their
respective Affiliates will make, change or revoke (or cause to be made,
changed, or revoked) any Tax election with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that is likely to increase any Tax liability (or Tax
indemnity obligation under this Agreement) of the other Parent Party or its
Affiliates without the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, of the other Parent Party.

 



 

5.12.5 _Amendment of Tax Returns_. Buyer shall not amend any Tax Return of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that relates to a Tax period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless required by applicable Law.

 



 

5.12.6 _Transfer Taxes_. Any transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall be paid one-
half by Seller and one-half by Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, Transfer
Taxes shall not include any Tax imposed on or measured by income or gains,
including any business activity Taxes. The Seller and Buyer and their
respective Affiliates shall cooperate in minimizing any Transfer Taxes.

 



 

5.12.7 _Tax Refunds_. Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller Tax
refunds of the Company or Company Subsidiaries actually received from a
Governmental Authority with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ ,
_however_ , such refunds will not include any reduction of Taxes for a Post-
Closing Tax Period due to the carryforward of attributes attributable to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer is entitled to retain any Tax refunds of the
Company or Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period or
attributable to a Tax attribute that is attributable to a Post-Closing Tax
Period. Buyer and Seller will equitably apportion any Tax refund for a
Straddle Period in a manner consistent with the principles set forth in
_Section 8.2.2_. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be entitled to
any refunds that are attributable to any carryback of net operating losses,
capital losses or other Tax attributes relating to a Post-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

5.12.8 _Buyer Covenants_.

 



 

5.12.8.1 Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall effect or engage in any
transactions or other actions relating to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary

its Affiliates or any indemnification obligations of Seller under _Article 8_
by more than a _de minimis_ amount.

federal income tax purposes, (C) cause the Company to be merged with or into
Buyer or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Buyer, or (D) take any other action
that would reasonably be expected, if treated as part of the same plan with
the Transaction, to cause the Transaction to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

5.12.8.3 Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not, and following
the Closing Buyer shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries not to,
(A) report the Transaction as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), or (B) take
any other position for Tax purposes that the Transaction qualifies as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law).

 



 

5.12.9 _Cooperation_. Buyer, Seller, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to _Section

request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Further, after the Closing,
Buyer shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to furnish Tax
information to Seller as reasonably requested in order to permit Seller to
prepare and timely file the Tax Returns described in clause (A) of the first
sentence of _Section 5.12.3.1_. The Parties further agree, upon request, to
use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

5.12.10 _Tax Claims_. With respect to any inquiries, audits or similar
proceedings by any Taxing Authority relating to Taxes with respect to the
Company or Company Subsidiaries (a " _Tax Claim_ ") and attributable to a
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or otherwise relating to,
or affecting, a Seller Consolidated Tax Return, Seller shall control at its
own expense all Tax Claims and may make all decisions taken in connection with
such Tax Claims (including selection of counsel and settlement of such Tax
Claims), _provided_ that Buyer will be entitled to participate in any Tax
Claims at its own expense (except to the extent such Tax Claim relates to a
Seller

 



      
 

 



 

Consolidated Tax Return); _provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to any
Tax Claim relating to a Tax Return other than a Seller Consolidated Tax Return
that could reasonably be expected to increase any Tax liability of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) by more than a de minimis amount for a Straddle Period
or Post-Closing Tax Period, (x) Buyer will be entitled to participate in such
Tax Claims at its own expense, (y) Seller shall provide Buyer copies of all
material written correspondence and other material documents relevant to such
Tax Claims, and (z) Seller will not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax
Claim without the written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall control at its own
expense all proceedings attributable to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle
Period or Post-Closing Tax Period and may make all decisions taken in
connection with such Tax Claims (including selection of counsel and settlement
of such Tax Claims); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any Tax
Claims for which Seller would have an obligation to indemnify under this
Agreement or that could reasonably be expected to increase any Tax liability
of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) by more than a de minimis amount, (x)
Seller will be entitled to participate in such Tax Claims at its own expense,
(y) Buyer shall provide Seller copies of all material written correspondence
and other material documents relevant to such Tax Claims, and (z) solely with
respect to any Tax Claims for which Seller would have an obligation to
indemnify under this Agreement and Buyer has not waived such Seller
obligation, Buyer shall not settle such Tax Claim without the written consent
of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

 **Section 5.13** ** ****_Legal Representation and Attorney-Client
Privilege._**

 



 

Recognizing that Baker Botts L.L.P., Cooley LLP, and the legal departments of
Seller and the Company (together, the " _Legal Advisors_ ") have each provided
legal advice to Seller, L LLC or the Company prior to the Closing, and that
the Legal Advisors (other than the legal department of the Company) intend to
act as legal counsel to Seller and L LLC after the Closing, after the Closing
Buyer hereby agrees (A) to cause the Company to waive any conflicts that may
arise in connection with the Legal Advisors (other than the legal department
of the Company) representing Seller or L LLC after the Closing, and (B) that
attorney-client communications and privileges arising therefrom between the
Legal Advisors and Seller, L LLC and/or the Company regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall be the property of Seller and L LLC.

 



 

 **Section 5.14** ** ****_Financing._**

 



 

5.14.1 Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using reasonable
best efforts to (A) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and, if entered
into prior to the Closing, the definitive documentation with respect to the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter (such definitive
documentation entered into prior to the Closing, if any, the " _Definitive
Debt Agreements_ "), (B) negotiate and execute the Definitive Debt

 



      
 

 



 

Agreements on terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter
(including any "flex" provisions thereof) and, upon execution thereof, deliver
a copy thereof to Seller, (C) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable Buyer and its Subsidiaries in the Commitment Letter and Definitive
Debt Agreements that are within its control and comply with its obligations
thereunder and not take or fail to take any action that would be reasonably
expected to prevent or impede or delay the availability of the Debt Financing,
(D) take each of the actions required of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
_Sections 5.15.1(A)-(D)_ below with respect to itself and its Subsidiaries,
and (E) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and Definitive Debt
Agreements in the event of a breach or other failure to fund by the Lenders
that impedes or delays the Closing, including by seeking specific performance
of the parties thereunder.

 



 

5.14.2 In the event that all conditions to the Debt Financing have been
satisfied, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders
and the other persons providing such Debt Financing to fund such Debt
Financing on the Closing Date (including by taking enforcement action to cause
such Lenders to fund such Debt Financing).

 



 

5.14.3 Buyer shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Agreements, and/or substitute other
debt (but not equity financing) for all or any portion of the Debt Financing
from the same and/or alternative financing sources, provided that any such
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any
provision of the Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Agreements that amends
the Debt Financing and/or substitution of all or any portion of the Debt
Financing shall not (i) expand upon the conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter, (ii) prevent or impede or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
(iii) provide for terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) that
are, in the aggregate, less favorable to Buyer, Seller and the Company than
those in the Commitment Letter. Buyer shall be permitted to reduce the amount
of Financing under the Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Agreements in its
reasonable discretion, provided, that Buyer shall not reduce the Debt
Financing to an amount committed below the amount that is required, together
with the financial resources of Buyer, including cash on hand and the proceeds
of loans under existing revolving credit facilities of Buyer, to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and provided further that
such reduction shall not (a) expand upon the conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter, (b) prevent or impede or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
(c) provide for other terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions)
that are, in the aggregate, less favorable to Buyer, Seller and the Company
than those in the Commitment Letter.

 



 

5.14.4 If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or Buyer
becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes any portion of the Debt
Financing unavailable, in each case, on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Agreements, as applicable, and
such portion

 



      
 

 



 

is reasonably required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event alternative
financing from alternative financing sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided, that
without the prior written consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), no such alternative financing (x) shall be equity
financing or (y) shall be on terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions and conditions to funding) that are not, in the aggregate,
materially less favorable to Buyer, Seller and the Company as those in the
Commitment Letter. Buyer shall give Seller prompt oral and written notice (but
in any event not later than 48 hours after the occurrence or discovery
thereof) of any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letter or
Definitive Debt Agreements or of any condition not likely to be satisfied, in
each case, of which Buyer becomes aware or any termination or waiver,
amendment or other modification of the Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt
Agreements. Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its effort to arrange
the Debt Financing and shall provide to Seller copies of all documents related
to the Debt Financing (excluding fee letters and engagement letters, except to
the extent that such documents contain any conditions to funding, "flex"
provisions or other substantive provisions (excluding provisions related
solely to fees and economic terms agreed to by the parties) regarding the
terms and conditions of the Debt Financing). In the event that Buyer commences
an enforcement action to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Debt Agreements and/or cause the Lenders to fund the Debt Financing
(any such action, a " _Financing Action_ "), Buyer shall (x) keep Seller
reasonably informed of the status of the Debt Financing Action and (y) at the
request of Seller, shall make Buyers employees and other representatives
(other than any of its investment bankers, financial advisors or Lenders)
reasonably available to discuss the status of, and material developments with
respect to, the Financing Action.

 



 

 **Section 5.15** ** ****_Financing Cooperation._**

 



 

5.15.1 In order to assist Buyer with obtaining the Debt Financing, Seller and
the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to provide such
assistance and cooperation as Buyer and Buyer Representatives may reasonably
request, including using reasonable best efforts to (A) provide Buyer and
Buyer Representatives with information as reasonably requested for Buyers
preparation of any marketing material, (B) make senior management (with
appropriate seniority and expertise) of the Company reasonably available for a
reasonable number of customary syndication, presentations and lender meetings,
(C) cooperate with current or prospective lenders and their respective
advisors in performing their due diligence and (D) help procure reasonably
requested certificates or documents with respect to the Debt Financing,
including pledge and security documents, customary certificates (including a
certificate with respect to solvency matters), legal opinions and real estate
and other collateral documentation.

 



   

     
 

 



 

5.15.2 Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.15_ to the contrary, in no
event shall Seller, the Company or any Affiliate of Seller or the Company, be
required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability in
connection with the Debt Financing or have any liability or obligation with
respect thereto. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse
Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Seller or the Company in connection with the Debt Financing or
their cooperation contemplated by this _Section 5.15_.

 



 

5.15.3 Without affecting Buyers rights under this Agreement, Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller Indemnified Parties (as defined in _Section
8.3_) from and against any and all Losses (as defined in _Section 8.2_)
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to indemnify and
hold harmless Seller Indemnified Parties to the extent that such Losses arise
from or are related to information provided by any Seller Indemnified Party to
Buyer in writing specifically for use in the Debt Financing that is inaccurate
in any material respect or that omitted to include information that was
necessary to make the information provided not misleading in any material
respect, in light of the circumstances under which it was made.

 



 

5.15.4 In the event that the Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Agreements
are amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, including as a
result of obtaining alternative financing in accordance with _Section 5.14_,
or if Buyer substitutes other financing for all or a portion of the Debt
Financing in accordance with _Section 5.14_, each of Buyer, Seller and the
Company shall comply with its covenants in this Agreement with respect to the
Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Agreements, as applicable, as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified and with respect to such other
financing to the same extent that Buyer, Seller and the Company would have
been obligated to comply with respect to the Debt Financing.

 



 

5.15.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
each of the Parties: (A) agrees that all claims, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any lender party with
respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Lenders_ ") (which defined term shall
include the Lenders and their respective Affiliates, equityholders, members,
partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives
involved in the Debt Financing) in any way relating to this Agreement or
transactions contemplated thereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing, the
Definitive Debt Agreements or the performance thereof, shall be brought only
in the forum set forth in Section 9.13; (B) agrees that all claims or causes
of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
against any of the Lenders in any way relating to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of New York, without regard to Laws that may be
applicable under conflicts of Laws principles (whether of the State of New
York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of
any

 



      
 

 



 

jurisdiction other than the State of New York; and (C) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE DEBT
FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (x) neither the Company nor Seller, in their
respective capacities as parties to this Agreement, or their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members or shareholders shall have any rights or claims against any Lender,
relating to this Agreement, the Commitment Letter, the Definitive Debt
Agreements, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance hereof or thereof, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise and (y) no Lender shall have any liability to any of the Company,
any Company Subsidiaries, the Seller or their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or
shareholders relating to this Agreement, the Commitment Letter, the Definitive
Debt Agreements, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
the performance hereof or thereof, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise ; provided, however, that the Parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that in no event shall Seller have the right to specifically
enforce the Commitment Letter in connection with the Debt Financing or to
cause Buyer to enforce the Commitment Letter to cause the Lender to consummate
the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Lenders are intended third party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to the protections of, this _Section 5.15.5_, and this _Section
5.15.5_ may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in a
manner adverse to the Lenders without the prior written consent of the
Lenders.

 **Section 5.17** ** ****_Investor Directors._**

 



 

At the Closing, Buyer will cause four (4) designees of Seller to be appointed
to the Buyer Board as Investor Directors (as defined in the Investor Rights
Agreement). Such appointments shall be subject in all respects to the terms
and conditions contained in Section 3.5 of the Investor Rights Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Sellers two
designees to be Investor Directors identified to Buyer prior to the date
hereof (the " _Pre-Signing Investor Director Designees_ ") meet Buyers
standard qualifications for directors and, _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer
will take all necessary actions to approve the two additional designees of
Seller to be Investor Directors prior to the Closing (the " _Pre-Closing
Investor Director Designees_ "); _provided_ , _that_ , Seller shall notify
Buyer of the designation of the Pre-Closing Investor Director Designees no
later than September 30, 2014; _provided_ , _further_ , _that_ , if either
such Pre-Closing Investor Director Designee does not meet Buyers standard
qualifications for directors, Buyer will, within 15 Business Days of Sellers
notice to Buyer of such designations, notify Seller in writing of, and specify
the reasons why, such standard qualifications have been deemed not to have
been met. Buyer will take all necessary actions to approve, or, in the event
that any Pre-Closing Investor Director Designee does not meet Buyers standard
qualifications for directors, to provide Seller with an opportunity to
substitute a replacement Pre-Closing Investor Designee or Designees (which
replacement or replacements shall be designated within 15 Business Days of
Buyers written notice to Seller of the prior designees failure to meet
Buyers standard qualifications), such that four designees of Seller will be
appointed as Investor Directors at the Closing. At or prior to the Closing,
Buyer shall take all necessary actions (including increasing the number of
persons constituting the entire Buyer Board) as are necessary to cause there
to be sufficient vacancies or newly-created directorships on the Buyer Board
to permit the appointment of the Investor Directors to the Buyer Board at the
Closing in accordance with the preceding sentence. With respect to the Pre-
Signing Investor Director Designees, one shall be appointed to the class of

_4.3_ , _4.4_ and _4.7_ , or any certificate or ancillary document (other than
the Investor Rights Agreement) delivered pursuant hereto to the extent such
certificate or ancillary document speaks as to the representations and
warranties made by Buyer in _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.3_ , _4.4_ and _4.7_ ,
to be true and correct in all respects at and as of the date hereof and at and
as of the Closing Date (unless made as of another date, in which case, as of

such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement (but without giving
effect to any indemnification obligation of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement).

 **Section 8.4** ** ****_Indemnification Procedures._**

 



 

8.4.1 A claim for indemnification under this Agreement for any matter not
involving a third party claim shall be given by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party (as defined below) by written notice as promptly as
reasonably practicable after having knowledge of such claim (but in any case
within 15 Business Days after the Indemnified Party has knowledge of such
claim, or within such reasonably shorter period of time as may be necessary to
give the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to respond to such
claim), and include a statement specifying the basis for such claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give reasonably practicable notice
shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the Indemnifying Partys
obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party has suffered actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure.

 



 

8.4.2 In the event that any Litigation shall be instituted or that any claim
or demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under _Sections 8.2_ or _8.3_ (regardless of the
limitations set forth in _Section 8.5_) (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall as promptly as reasonably practicable after having
knowledge of such Third Party Claim (but in any case within 15 Business Days
after having knowledge of such Third Party Claim, or within such reasonably
shorter period of time as may be necessary to give the Indemnifying Party a
reasonable opportunity to respond to such claim), cause written notice of the
assertion of any Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered
by this indemnity to be forwarded to the applicable indemnifying Party under
_Sections 8.2_ or _8.3_ (such Party, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), and
include a statement specifying the basis for such claim. The failure of the
Indemnified Party to give

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party Claim shall not release, waive or
otherwise affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations with respect thereto
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual loss and
prejudice as a result of such failure. Subject to the provisions of this
_Section 8.4.2_, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole
expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any
Losses indemnified against hereunder; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party
shall, within a reasonable time after receiving the Indemnified Partys
written notice of the assertion of such Third Party Claim, (A) notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of its intent to do so; _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party must conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively
and diligently thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this regard and
(B) deliver a written confirmation to such Indemnified Party that, based on
the facts presented being true, the indemnification provisions of _Sections
8.2_ or _8.3_ , as applicable, are applicable to such Third Party Claim and
that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify such Indemnified Party in respect
of such claim pursuant and subject to the terms of this _Article 8_. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense and, in the course of defending such
Third Party Claim or otherwise, discovers that (i) the facts presented at the
time the Indemnifying Party confirmed the application of the indemnification
provisions hereof were not true and (ii) such untruth provides a reasonable
basis for asserting that the Indemnifying Party does not have any
indemnification obligation in respect of such Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnifying Party shall not be bound by such confirmation. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its
election as herein provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party for such Losses under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnified Party defends any Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party is not contesting its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party for such Losses under this Agreement, then the Indemnifying
Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the reasonable expenses of
defending such Third Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense
of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate
counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (a) so requested by the
Indemnifying Party to participate or (b) in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be required to pay for more than the reasonable fees and expenses of
more than one such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any
Third Party Claim.

 



 

Subject to the Parties taking necessary steps to preserve the attorney-client
or other privileges, the Parties agree to cooperate and provide reasonable
access to the other to such documents and information as may be reasonably
requested in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party
Claim. No Indemnified Party shall settle or compromise or consent to entry of
any judgment with respect to any such action for which it is entitled to
indemnification hereunder without the prior consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless the Indemnifying
Party shall have failed, after reasonable notice thereof, to undertake control
of such action in the manner provided above in this _Section 8.4.2_ to the
extent the Indemnifying Party was entitled to do so pursuant to this _Section
8.4.2_. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the consent of such
Indemnified Party, settle or compromise or consent to entry of any judgment
with respect to any such claim (x) in which any relief other than the payment
of money damages is or may be sought against such Indemnified Party or (y)
that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving to such
Indemnified Party by the claimant or claimants, release from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim.

 



 

8.4.3 _Sections 8.4.1_ and _8.4.2_ shall not apply to any Tax Claims to which
the provisions of _Section 5.12.10_ apply.

 



 

 **Section 8.5** ** ****_Limitations on Indemnification for Breaches of
Representations and Warranties._**

 



 

8.5.1 Seller shall not have any liability under Section _8.2.1.1_ and Buyer
shall not have any liability under _Section 8.3.1.1_, unless, in each case,
the aggregate amount of Losses incurred and indemnifiable by the Seller
Indemnified Parties or the Buyer Indemnified Parties, respectively, thereunder
exceeds $4,300,000 (the " _Basket_ ") and, in such event, Buyer or Seller, as
applicable shall be required to pay the amount of all such Losses in excess of
the Basket; _provided_ that the Basket limitation shall not apply to Losses
related to the failure to be true and correct of any of the representations
and warranties contained in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.4_ , _4.1_ ,
_4.2_ , _4.3_ or _4.4_.

 



 

8.5.2 Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party
under _Section 8.2.1.1_ and Buyer shall not be required to indemnify any
Seller Indemnified Party under _Section 8.3.1.1_, in each case, for an
aggregate amount of Losses greater than $86,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ");
_provided_ that there shall be no Cap with respect to Losses related to the
failure to be true and correct of any of the representations and warranties
contained in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.4_ , _4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.3_ or
_4.4_.

 



 

8.5.3 For purposes of calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality or Company
Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations and warranties
shall be disregarded.

 



 

8.5.4 Seller shall have no right of contribution or other recourse against the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers,
employees, affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, assigns or
successors for any Third Party Claims asserted by any Buyer Indemnified Party,
except as set forth in _Section 8.3_.

 



      
 

 



 

8.5.5 The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement, or
any certificate or ancillary document (other than the Investor Rights
Agreement) delivered pursuant hereto, shall not be affected by any
investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreements, will not affect the right to indemnification or
any other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements.

 



 

8.5.6 In the event of any Loss in respect of which an Indemnified Party
asserts an indemnification claim, the Indemnified Party shall use reasonable
best efforts to mitigate the consequences of such Loss; _provided_ that if the
underlying event is determined to give rise to Losses that are indemnifiable
or recoverable hereunder, any reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses
incurred in connection with such mitigation shall be deemed to be Losses.

 



 

8.5.7 No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any indemnification to the
extent that the cost or benefit related to such Loss was reflected in or taken
into account in the calculation of the Closing Working Capital Amount or in
any amounts that have reduced the Closing Cash Consideration pursuant to
clauses (D) and (E) of _Section 2.1.1.1_.

 



 

8.5.8 Any indemnity payment due and payable by an Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party under this Agreement shall be (A) net of (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, reduced, whether retroactively or otherwise by) any and
all third party insurance proceeds and recoveries in respect of third party
indemnification obligations actually received by the Indemnified Party thereof
in respect of such Loss, whether such proceeds are received before or after
indemnity payments are made; _provided_ that such proceeds and recovery will
be determined net of the reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
in connection with or otherwise related to prosecuting the claims necessary to
obtain such proceeds and recovery and (B) reduced to take account of any net
Tax benefit actually taken into account (calculated on a "with and without"
basis) with respect to a Tax year ending on or before the last day of the
third (3rd) full Tax year following the Closing Date or, if later, in the Tax
year in which such Loss is incurred for Tax purposes and in the next
succeeding year.

 



 

8.5.9 In no event shall any Partys indemnification obligation hereunder cover
or include punitive, exemplary or similar damages, or lost profits (if and to
the extent not reasonably foreseeable) suffered by any other party entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement except to the extent such damages are
paid by an Indemnified Party to a third party.

 



      
 

 



 

8.5.10 All indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Article 8_ shall
be treated by the Parties as adjustments to the Purchase Price unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

 **Section 8.6** ** ****_Exclusivity._**

 



 

8.6.1 Following the Closing, except in the case of (A) fraud and (B) with
respect to matters for which the remedy of specific performance, injunctive
relief or other non-monetary equitable remedies are available (and in such
cases, this exception shall apply only with respect to such remedies), the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties with respect to any and all claims
arising from any breach of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article 8_.

 



 

8.6.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including
with respect to _Sections 3.20_ , _4.20_ and _8.6.1_ , the Parties acknowledge
and agree that (A) no Party waives any claim for fraud (which claim, to the
extent successful, shall include and be limited to entitlement to reasonable
attorneys fees) and (B) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed
to waive such a claim or acknowledge that any element of such a claim cannot
be established.

be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement.

 



 

 **Section 9.16** ** ****_Specific Performance._**

 



 

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in

actions that would be inconsistent with applicable Law.

This SERVICES AGREEMENT, dated as of [*], 201[] (this " _Services Agreement_
"), is entered into between Liberty Interactive Corporation, a Delaware

Delaware corporation (" _FTD_ "), Liberty and Provide, FTD will acquire 100%

for the consideration set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement (the "
_Transactions_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and pursuant
to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, prior to the closing of the
Transactions (the " _Closing_ "); Provide will transfer (x) the shares of
common stock of its Subsidiary conducting the business known as RedEnvelope,

owned Subsidiary of Liberty and (y) certain employees and assets of Provide
and the Company Subsidiaries primarily used in the business of RedEnvelope, as
mutually agreed by FTD and Liberty pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase
Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, in connection with the Transactions, Liberty and its Subsidiaries,
including RedEnvelope, desire to procure certain services from Provide for a
period of time, and Provide is willing to provide such services during a
transition period commencing on the Effective Date (as defined in _Section
6.01_), on the terms and conditions set forth in this Services Agreement.

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
provisions set forth in this Services Agreement, the Parties hereby agree as
follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 _Definitions_

 



 

1.01. All terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 _Agreement To Provide and Accept Services_

 



 

2.01. _Provision of Services._

 



 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, Provide
agrees with Liberty that it shall provide, or, at its discretion, shall cause
its Subsidiaries and their respective employees designated by Provide (such
designated Subsidiaries and employees, together with Provide, being herein
collectively referred to as the " _Service Providers_ ") to provide, to

      
 

 



 

RedEnvelope (or another Subsidiary of Liberty as determined by Liberty,
RedEnvelope and such other Subsidiaries, together with Liberty, each being
referred to herein as a " _Receiving Party_ " or, collectively, the "
_Receiving Parties_ ") the services (" _Services_ ") listed on the Schedule of
Services attached hereto as Exhibit A (the " _Services Schedule_ "). Each
Service shall be provided in exchange for the consideration set forth with
respect to such Service on the Services Schedule or as the Parties may
otherwise agree in writing. Each Service shall be provided and accepted in
accordance with the terms, limitations and conditions set forth herein and on
the Services Schedule.

 



 

2.02. _Books and Records; Availability of Information._ Each of the Service
Providers shall create and maintain accurate books and records in connection
with the provision of the Services performed or caused to be performed by
them. Upon reasonable notice from a Receiving Party, the Service Providers
shall make available for inspection and copying by such Receiving Partys
agents such books and records to the extent relating to the Services provided
to such Receiving Party hereunder during reasonable business hours. Such
inspection shall be conducted by such Receiving Party or its agents in a
manner that will not unreasonably interfere with the normal business
operations of the Service Providers. The Receiving Party shall make available
on a timely basis to the Service Provider all information and materials
reasonably requested by the Service Provider to enable it to provide the
Services. The Receiving Party shall provide to the Service Provider reasonable
access to the Receiving Partys premises to the extent necessary for the
purpose of providing the applicable Services.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 _Services; Payment; Independent Contractors_

 



 

3.01. _Services To Be Provided._ Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties
(including to the extent specified in the applicable entry on the Services
Schedule), the Service Providers shall be required to perform the Services
only in a manner, scope, nature and quality as provided by or within Provide
that is similar in all material respects to the manner in which such Services
were performed immediately prior to the Effective Date. The Service Providers
shall act under this Services Agreement solely as an independent contractor
and not as an agent or employee of any Receiving Party or any of such
Receiving Partys Affiliates. [As an independent contractor, all overhead and
personnel necessary to the Services required of the Service Provider hereunder
shall be the Service Providers sole responsibility and shall be at the
Service Providers sole cost and expense.](1) The Service Provider shall not
have the authority to bind a Receiving Party by contract or otherwise. The
Parties will use good faith efforts to reasonably cooperate with each other in
all matters relating to the provision and receipt of Services, including,
without limitation, providing, subject to _Section 3.02_, any necessary
licenses with respect to Intellectual Property of a Party in connection with
the provision of Services.

 



 

3.02. _Third Party Consents._ The Receiving Parties understand, acknowledge
and agree that certain Services to be provided by the Service Providers may be
provided by or through the use of unaffiliated third parties on behalf of a
Service Provider pursuant to contracts, including

      
 

 



 

licenses of Intellectual Property, to which the Receiving Parties are not a
party (collectively, " _Third Party Contracts_ "). The Receiving Parties also
understand, acknowledge and agree that the continued participation in such
Third Party Contracts by such third parties in providing Services may require
the Service Providers to obtain additional consents, approvals, permissions or
licenses (collectively, " _Authorizations_ "), and that obtaining such
Authorizations may involve additional costs, expenses, fees, charges or
commissions (" _Authorization Expenses_ "). The Service Providers agree to use
reasonable best efforts to seek and obtain any Authorizations necessary
pursuant to such Third Party Contracts to provide Services to the Receiving
Parties; provided, however, that the Service Providers shall not be required
to obtain any Authorizations (i) if such Authorizations would require the
Service Providers to modify, amend or otherwise alter a Third Party Contract
in a manner that, in the Service Providers good faith judgment, is not
commercially reasonable or (ii) to the extent that the Receiving Parties do
not agree to be fully responsible for any Authorization Expenses related
thereto. On termination or expiration of any Third Party Contract during the
term of this Services Agreement, the Service Provider shall not be obligated
to continue to provide, or cause the provision of, the Services to which the
relevant Third Party Contract relates, but at the Receiving Partys request,
the Service Provider shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the
Receiving Party and reasonably assist it to enter into its own agreements with
third parties (including identifying and approaching the applicable vendor (or
another third party vendor) with whom the Receiving Party shall enter into its
own third party contract at a price and upon terms that are mutually agreeable
to the Receiving Party and such vendor relating to such Service).

 



 

3.03. _Additional Services._

 



 

(a) From time to time during the term applicable to any Service being provided
by a Service Provider, Liberty may request, in writing, for Provide (i) to
provide additional or different services which Provide is not expressly
obligated to provide under this Services Agreement if such services are of the
type and scope provided by Provide or its Subsidiaries (other than
RedEnvelope) to RedEnvelope during fiscal year 2014 or (ii) expand the scope
of any Service (such additional or expanded services, the " _Additional
Services_ ").

 



 

(b) Promptly after Liberty has requested Additional Services pursuant to
_Section 3.03(a)_, a representative of each of Liberty and Provide shall in
good faith negotiate the terms of a supplement to the Services Schedule which
will describe in detail the service, term and price to be charged for the
Additional Services. Once agreed to in writing, the supplement to the Services
Schedule (a " _Services Agreement Supplement_ ") shall be deemed part of this
Services Agreement as of such date and the Additional Services shall be deemed
"Services" provided by such Service Provider to such Receiving Party
hereunder, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Services
Agreement. The foregoing provision shall not be construed as imposing any
obligation on the part of Service Provider to enter into any agreement with
the Receiving Party or to continue to negotiate with the Receiving Party in
the event that Service Provider determines in good faith not to provide the
requested additional service.

 



 

3.04. _Payments._ [Except as set forth on the Services Schedule], statements
will be delivered to the Receiving Party within fifteen (15) days after the
end of each month by the Service Provider, and each such statement shall set
forth a brief description of such Services, the

      
 

 



 

amounts charged therefor, and, except as the Parties may agree or as set forth
on the Services Schedule, such undisputed amounts shall be due and payable by
the Receiving Party within thirty (30) days after the date of such statement.
Interest shall be payable on any amounts that are not paid by the due date for
payment. Interest shall accrue and be calculated on a daily basis at an annual
rate equal to the prime rate (which shall mean the "prime rate" published in
the "Money Rates" section of _The Wall Street Journal_ ) plus 2.0% or, if
less, the maximum rate allowed by Law. Receiving Parties shall not be entitled
to set off or reduce payments owed to Service Providers hereunder by any
amounts that it claims are owed to it by Service Providers under any other
agreement.

 



 

3.05. _Disclaimer of Warranty._ THE SERVICES TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THIS
SERVICES AGREEMENT ARE FURNISHED AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
In the event that the provision of any Service for the account of the
Receiving Party by a Service Provider conflicts with the Service Providers
provision of such Service for its own account, priority for the provision of
such Service shall be allocated in an equitable manner on an aggregate basis,
and in a manner consistent with the Receiving Partys level of use of such
Service during fiscal year 2014 up to the Effective Date (or as described in
the applicable entry on the Services Schedule).

 



 

3.06. _Taxes._ Without limiting any provision of this Services Agreement, the
Receiving Party shall be responsible for and shall pay any and all sales, use,
service, value added, and other similar taxes or charges (together with any
related interest and penalties) imposed on, or payable with respect to, any
service fees or charges payable pursuant to this Services Agreement.

 



 

3.07. _Use of Services._ The Receiving Party, agrees with the Service Provider
that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, resell any
Services to any Person whatsoever or permit the use of the Services by any
person other than in connection with the conduct of the Receiving Partys
operations as conducted immediately prior to the Effective Date.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 _Term of Services_

 



 

4.01. Subject to _Section 6.01_, the provision of each Service shall commence
on the date hereof and shall terminate on April 30, 2015 or as of the date
indicated for each such Service in the applicable entry on the Services
Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to the applicable entry on the
Services Schedule, any Service may be cancelled or reduced in amount or any
portion thereof by the Receiving Party upon ten (10) days written notice
thereof [(or such other notice period if one is set forth for such Service in
the applicable entry on the Services Schedule)].

      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE V**

 



 

 _Liabilities_

 



 

5.01. _Limitation of Liability._ Subject to _Section 5.02_ hereof, the

transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or
that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable
in the Delaware Courts, or that this Services Agreement or any such document
may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties irrevocably agree
that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined in the Delaware Courts. The Parties hereby consent to and grant the
Delaware Courts jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the
extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree
that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 7.05 hereof or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS SERVICES AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY

7.06. _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Services Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that Provide, on the one hand, or
Liberty, on the other hand, whichever is not in breach of this Services
Agreement, will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Services Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which
it may be entitled at law or in equity, without the necessity of posting or
securing any bond with respect thereto.

 



 

7.07. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Services Agreement may be executed
in two or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
This Services Agreement shall become effective when each Party hereto shall
have received counterparts hereof signed by the other Party hereto.

 



 

7.08. _Captions_. The captions herein are included for convenience of
reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or interpretation
hereof.

 



 

7.09. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Services Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Services Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Services Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible; provided, however, that in the absence of an
agreement as to how to modify this Services Agreement, the remainder of this
Services Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application
of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto, and such invalid, void
or unenforceable provision of this Services Agreement shall be replaced with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the fullest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such severed provision.

 



 

7.10. _No Strict Construction_. The Parties each acknowledge that this
Services Agreement has been prepared jointly by the Parties hereto and shall
not be strictly construed against any Party hereto.

 



 

7.11. _Ownership of Work Product._ The Service Provider acknowledges and
agrees that it will acquire no right, title or interest (including any license
rights or rights of use) to any work

      
 

 



 

product resulting from the provision of Services hereunder for the Receiving
Partys exclusive use and such work product shall remain the exclusive
property of the Receiving Party. Each Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees
that it will acquire no right, title or interest (other than a non-exclusive,
worldwide right of use) to any work product resulting from the provision of
Services hereunder that is not for the Receiving Partys exclusive use and
such work product shall remain the exclusive property, subject to license, of
the Service Provider.

 



 

7.12. _Confidentiality_. Each of Liberty and Provide (and their Subsidiaries)
shall hold, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its
respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors and agents to hold, in confidence, all confidential information and
documents obtained from the other in connection with the provision of the
Services, provided that any and all such Persons and entities to whom any such
disclosure is made agree to be bound by the provisions of this Section. The
foregoing obligations shall apply unless disclosure is compelled by judicial
or administrative process or by other requirements of law. Information and
documents of one Party (the " _Disclosing Party_ ") shall not be deemed to be
confidential for purposes of this _Section 7.12_ to the extent such
information or document (i) is previously known to or in the possession of the
other Party (the " _Recipient_ ") and is not otherwise subject to a
requirement to keep confidential, (ii) becomes publicly available by means
other than a breach by Recipient of the confidentiality obligations of this
Services Agreement or (iii) is received from a third party without, to the
knowledge of the Recipient after reasonable diligence, a duty of
confidentiality owed to the Disclosing Party.

 



 

7.13. _Force Majeure._ No Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in
performing any of its obligations under this Service Agreement so long as and
to the extent such failure or delay is due to any cause beyond its reasonable
control, including any act of God or a public enemy or terrorist, act of any
military, civil or regulatory authority, change in any Law or regulation,
fire, flood, earthquake, storm or other like event, disruption or outage of
communications (including the Internet or other networked environment), power
or other utility, labor problem, unavailability of supplies or extraordinary
market conditions or any other cause beyond its reasonable control, whether
similar or dissimilar to any of the foregoing. Each Service Provider will
promptly notify the Receiving Party, in writing, upon determining that the
occurrence of such event of force majeure will cause any material interruption
of Service or other material delay or failure to perform. Upon the cessation
of the force majeure event, such Service Provider will use reasonable best
efforts to resume, or to cause any other relevant Service Provider to resume,
its performance with the least practicable delay (provided that, at the
election of the applicable Receiving Party, the applicable term for such
suspended Service shall be extended by the length the force majeure event
caused an interruption or delay of Service). If the provision of any Services
is suspended pursuant to this Section 7.13, then the obligations of the
Receiving Party with respect to such suspended Services shall likewise be
suspended.

 



 

7.14 _Stock Purchase Agreement_. Nothing contained in this Services Agreement
is intended or shall be construed to amend, modify, augment or decrease in any
respect, or constitute a waiver of, any of the rights and obligations of the
parties under the Stock Purchase Agreement.

 



 

7.15 _Limitation on Scope_. **NEITHER PARTY ASSUMES ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR
OBLIGATIONS WHATSOEVER IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OTHER THAN THE RESPONSIBILITIES
AND OBLIGATIONS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS**

      
 

 



 

 **AGREEMENT.**
