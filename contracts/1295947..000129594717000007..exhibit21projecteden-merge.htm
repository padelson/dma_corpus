satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), or at such other
place or on such other date as is mutually agreeable to Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative; provided, that notwithstanding the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 3, if the Marketing Period has
not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions (other

Company Unitholders, each class, series and subclass of Company Units issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 2.6, will be cancelled and
extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to receive that
portion of the Final Merger Consideration as set forth in this Section 2.6 and
shall no longer be outstanding. Each class, series and subclass of Company
Units then held by the Company or any other member of the Company Group (or
held in the Company's treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease

(i) Each class, series and subclass of Company Units that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into

with the Distribution Waterfall.

(ii) For purposes of calculating the amount to be paid to each Company
Unitholder at the Effective Time, the amounts described in this Section 2.6(a)
shall be calculated assuming that the Final Merger Consideration is equal to
the Aggregate Initial Consideration, and shall be adjusted following the
Closing as set forth herein. The amount to be paid to each Company Unitholder
for each class, series and subclass of Company Units held shall be rounded
down to the nearest whole cent.

(iii) All classes, series and subclasses of Company Units, when cancelled,
extinguished, and converted pursuant to this Section 2.6(a), shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired, and each
former holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the consideration provided for in this Section
2.6(a).

(iv) No Company Unitholder shall have any rights to appraisal under Section
18-210 of the DLLCA or otherwise with respect to the Company Units held by
such Company Unitholder as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Conversion of Merger Sub's Limited Liability Company Interests. At and as
of the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of
Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company Unitholder, each limited
liability company interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to such time shall be automatically and immediately converted into and
exchanged for one (1) validly issued limited liability interest of the
Surviving Company.

at the Closing cash in an amount set forth for such Company Unitholder in the
Distribution Waterfall from the Payment Fund, which amount shall be paid by

therefor, cash in an amount set forth for such Company Unitholder in the
Distribution Waterfall, which amount shall be paid by the Paying Agent by
check or wire transfer in accordance with the instructions provided by such
Company Unitholder. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the
consideration payable from the Payment Fund upon the delivery of a Letter of
Transmittal.

(c) Neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Company (or any of their respective
Affiliates) shall be liable to a Company Unitholder or any other Person in

(a) Determination of Closing Amounts. No later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide Purchaser with good faith
estimates of (i) Working Capital of the Company Group as of immediately prior
to the Closing ("Estimated Working Capital") (prepared in accordance with the
"Working Capital Schedule" attached hereto and, with respect to all Tax items
included in Estimated Working Capital, calculated in a manner consistent with
the manner in which the Company Group calculated its Tax liability for the
fiscal year ended January 2, 2016), (ii) Cash of the Company Group as of
immediately prior to the Closing ("Estimated Cash"), (iii) Indebtedness of the

Company's good faith calculation of the

19 

amount of the Aggregate Initial Consideration based on such amounts. Prior to
the Closing, Purchaser shall have the right to review and comment upon each
such good faith estimate and the Company shall, acting in good faith,
incorporate Purchaser's comments into such estimates to the extent reasonable.

(b) Determination of Post-Closing Adjustment. No later than sixty (60) days
following the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers' Representative
good faith calculations of (i) the actual Working Capital of the Company Group
as of immediately prior to the Closing ("Actual Working Capital") (prepared in
accordance with the "Working Capital Schedule" attached hereto), (ii) actual
Cash of the Company Group as of immediately prior to the Closing ("Actual
Cash"), (iii) actual Indebtedness of the Company Group as of immediately prior
to the Closing ("Actual Indebtedness") and (iv) actual Sellers' Transaction
Expenses as of immediately prior to the Closing ("Actual Sellers' Transaction
Expenses").

(c) Disputed Final Adjustment.

(i) No later than sixty (60) days following the delivery by Purchaser of the
calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness and
Actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses, the Sellers' Representative shall notify
Purchaser in writing whether it accepts or disputes the accuracy of the
calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness and
Actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses. During such sixty (60) day period, the
Sellers' Representative and its agents shall be provided, subject to customary
confidentiality restrictions, during normal business hours and upon prior
written notice, with access to the financial books and records of Purchaser
and the Company Group as well as any relevant information and work papers as
it may reasonably request, in each case, to the extent related to Purchaser's
calculations of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness and
Actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses. If the Sellers' Representative accepts
the calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness
and Actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses determined pursuant to Section
2.10(b), or if the Sellers' Representative fails within such sixty (60) day
period to notify Purchaser in accordance with Section 2.10(c)(iii) of any
dispute with respect thereto, then the calculation of Actual Working Capital
determined pursuant to Section 2.10(b) shall be the "Final Working Capital,"
the calculation of Actual Cash determined pursuant to Section 2.10(b) shall be
the "Final Cash," the calculation of Actual Indebtedness determined pursuant
to Section 2.10(b) shall be the "Final Indebtedness" and the calculation of
Actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses determined pursuant to Section 2.10(b)
shall be the "Final Sellers' Transaction Expenses," which, in each case, shall
be deemed final and conclusive and binding on the parties hereto and each of
the other Company Unitholders.

(ii) If the Sellers' Representative disputes Purchaser's calculation of Actual
Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness and/or Actual Sellers'
Transaction Expenses, the Sellers' Representative shall provide written notice
to Purchaser no later than sixty (60) days following the delivery by Purchaser
to the Sellers' Representative of the calculation of Actual Working Capital,
Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness and Actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses (the
"Dispute Notice"), setting forth in reasonable detail those items

| | 

|

20 

that the Sellers' Representative disputes in good faith and the Sellers'
Representative's good faith calculation of such disputed items (which, with
respect to Actual Working Capital, shall be calculated in accordance with the
"Working Capital Schedule" attached hereto), and any items not so disputed
shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto and each
of the other Company Unitholders. During the thirty (30) day period following
delivery of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall
negotiate in good faith with a view to resolving their disagreements over the
disputed items. During such thirty (30) day period and until the final
determination of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness
and/or Actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses, in accordance with this Section
2.10(c)(ii) or Section 2.10(c)(iii), as the case may be, (as so determined, or
as determined pursuant to Section 2.10(c)(i) above, "Final Working Capital,"
"Final Cash," "Final Indebtedness" and "Final Sellers' Transaction Expenses,"
respectively), the Sellers' Representative and its agents shall be provided
with such access to the financial books and records of Purchaser and the
Company Group as well as any relevant information and work papers as
reasonably necessary for the Sellers' Representative to evaluate any disputed
item. If Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative resolve their differences
over the disputed items in accordance with the foregoing procedure, Final
Working Capital, Final Cash, Final Indebtedness and Final Sellers' Transaction
Expenses shall be the amounts agreed upon by them in writing. If Purchaser and
the Sellers' Representative fail to resolve in writing their differences over
the disputed items within such thirty (30) day period, then Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative shall, within ten (10) Business Days, jointly request
that a mutually agreeable accounting firm (or, if they cannot agree on an
accounting firm or such firm declines the engagement, an accounting firm
selected by lot from the top eight (8) accounting firms listed in Accounting
Today's then most recent annual "Top 100 Firms" listing) (the "Accounting
Arbitrator") provide an engagement letter for making a binding determination
as to the disputed items in accordance with this Agreement. Either Purchaser
or the Sellers' Representative may send such joint request to the Accounting
Arbitrator and failure of either to provide comments to a proposed engagement
letter within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such proposed engagement
letter from the Accounting Arbitrator shall be deemed acquiescence to the
terms proposed by the Accounting Arbitrator and any additional or modified
terms timely submitted by the other.

(iii) Within thirty (30) calendar days after the engagement of the Accounting
Arbitrator, Purchaser shall provide the Accounting Arbitrator with a
submission regarding the disputed items, including any supporting
documentation; thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, the Sellers'
Representative shall provide the Accounting Arbitrator a submission regarding
the disputed items, including any supporting documentation; five (5) Business
Days thereafter, Purchaser shall provide the Accounting Arbitrator with a
reply submission, including further supporting documentation, that responds to
points raised in the Sellers' Representative's submission; and, if requested
by either party or the Accounting Arbitrator, within thirty (30) calendar days
thereafter, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall participate in a
joint session with the Accounting Arbitrator at which they can make further
oral presentations and the Accounting Arbitrator can ask questions of them.
The Accounting Arbitrator will under the terms of its engagement have no more
than ten (10) Business Days from the final submission of information by
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative within

21 

which to render its written decision with respect to the disputed items (and
only with respect to any unresolved disputed items set forth in the Dispute
Notice) and the final calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash,
Actual Indebtedness and Actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses shall be based
solely on the resolution of such disputed items. The Accounting Arbitrator
shall review such submissions and base its determination solely on such
submissions. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Arbitrator may not
assign a value to any item greater than the maximum value for such item
claimed by either Purchaser in its calculation pursuant to Section 2.10(b) or
the Sellers' Representative in its Dispute Notice or less than the minimum
value for such item claimed by either such party therein, and must determine
each disputed item using only Purchaser's and the Sellers' Representatives'
submissions and oral presentations (if applicable), the Accounting Principles
and the definitions contained herein (including GAAP to the extent set forth
in the Working Capital Schedule). The decision of the Accounting Arbitrator
shall be deemed final and binding upon the parties hereto and each other
Company Unitholder and shall be enforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction and the Accounting Arbitrator's final calculation of, as
applicable, Actual Working Capital shall be deemed the "Final Working
Capital," the Accounting Arbitrator's final calculation of Actual Cash shall
be deemed the "Final Cash," the Accounting Arbitrator's final calculation of
Actual Indebtedness shall be deemed the "Final Indebtedness," and the
Accounting Arbitrator's final calculation of Actual Sellers' Transaction
Expenses shall be deemed the "Final Sellers' Transaction Expenses." The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be allocated to be paid by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and each of the Company Unitholders, severally and
not jointly, in proportion to the applicable percentage set forth on the
attached "Sellers Holdings Schedule" (the "Applicable Percentage"), on the
other, based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative (in the case of the
Company Unitholders) bears to the amount actually contested by such party, as
determined by the Accounting Arbitrator.

(d) Payment following Calculation of Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final
Indebtedness and Final Sellers' Transaction Expenses.

(i) Following the determination of Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final
Indebtedness and Final Sellers' Transaction Expenses in accordance with
Section 2.10(c), the Aggregate Initial Consideration shall be recalculated by
substituting the Final Working Capital for the Estimated Working Capital in
Section 1.1, the Final Cash for the Estimated Cash in Section 1.1, the Final
Indebtedness for the Estimated Indebtedness in Section 1.1, and the Final
Sellers' Transaction Expenses for the Estimated Sellers' Transaction Expenses
in Section 1.1 (the "Adjusted Aggregate Initial Consideration") and if (after
taking into account any Upward Closing Working Capital Adjustment or Downward
Closing Working Capital Adjustment at the Closing):

(A) the Adjusted Aggregate Initial Consideration is greater than the Aggregate
Initial Consideration on the Closing Date, then such difference shall be paid
by Purchaser to the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit of each of the
Company Unitholders in accordance with such Person's

22 

Applicable Percentage) and Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall
promptly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to disburse to the Sellers'
Representative (for the benefit of each of the Company Unitholders in
accordance with such Person's Applicable Percentage) the then-current balance
of the Adjustment Escrow Fund;

(B) the Aggregate Initial Consideration is greater than the Adjusted Aggregate
Initial Consideration, then (1) Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative
shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to disburse to Purchaser
such difference and (2) the funds remaining (if any) in the Adjustment Escrow
Fund, after giving effect to clause (1), shall be released to the Sellers'
Representative (for the benefit of each of the Company Unitholders in
accordance with such Person's Applicable Percentage); provided that, if the
Adjustment Escrow Fund is insufficient to satisfy any such payment due to
Purchaser under this Section 2.10(d)(i)(B) (an "Adjustment Escrow Shortfall"),
then at Purchaser's option Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall
instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to disburse to Purchaser an amount equal
to the Adjustment Escrow Shortfall (or any portion thereof) from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund; provided, further, that if the Indemnity Escrow Fund is
insufficient to satisfy any such Adjustment Escrow Shortfall, then Purchaser
shall have no recourse against the Sellers' Representative, the Company
Unitholders or any other Person for recovery of any such insufficiency; and

(C) the Aggregate Initial Consideration is equal to the Adjusted Aggregate
Initial Consideration, the entire amount of the Adjustment Escrow Fund shall
be released to the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit of each of the
Company Unitholders in accordance with such Person's Applicable Percentage).

(ii) All payments pursuant to this Section 2.10(d) shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in advance by
the Sellers' Representative or Purchaser, as applicable, and all such
payments, instructions to the Escrow Agent contemplated by this Section
2.10(d) and releases from the Adjustment Escrow Fund and/or the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, as applicable, shall be made on or prior to the fifth (5th)
Business Day following the earliest to occur of: (A) the expiration of the
sixty (60) day period following Purchaser's delivery of its calculation of the
Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness and Actual Sellers'
Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 2.10(b) if the Sellers'
Representative does not timely dispute either of such amounts pursuant to
Section 2.10(c)(i); (B) the date of the Sellers' Representative's and
Purchaser's mutual determination of Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final
Indebtedness and Final Sellers' Transaction Expenses, as applicable, in the
event the Sellers' Representative timely disputes any of such amounts pursuant
to Section 2.10(c)(i) and the Sellers' Representative's and Purchaser's
differences are resolved without the engagement of an Accounting Arbitrator
pursuant to Section 2.10(c)(ii); and (C) the date of the Accounting
Arbitrator's determination

of Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final Indebtedness and/or Final Sellers'
Transaction Expenses, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.10(c)(iii) in the
event the Sellers' Representative timely disputes any of such amounts pursuant
to Section 2.10(c)(i) and the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser are unable
to resolve their differences pursuant to Section 2.10(c)(ii).

cooperate with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding

Authority or Applicable Law, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend
and participate thereat, in each case to the extent reasonably practicable.
The foregoing obligations in this Section 4.5(b) shall be subject to any pre-
existing confidentiality agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement and any

only to the outside counsel of the other parties and, subject to any
additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement the parties may mutually
enter into, will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or managers of the other parties unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials or such source's legal
counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.5,
materials provided to the other parties and its outside counsel may be

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors, managers, employees or agents to, take any and all
actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to avoid each and every
impediment under any Antitrust Law or order that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby so as to cause the conditions set forth in Sections
3.1(c), 3.1(d), 3.2(c) and 3.2(d) to be satisfied and to enable the Closing to
occur as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the Termination
Date, including:

(i) opposing any motion or action for a temporary, preliminary or permanent
injunction against the Merger; and

(ii) in the case of Purchaser, entering into a consent decree containing
Purchaser's agreement to hold separate and divest (pursuant to such terms as

the Company or Purchaser and its Affiliates as may be determined by any
Governmental Authority;

provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything set forth
anywhere else in this Agreement, in no event shall Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries be required to (A) agree to sell, lease, license,
transfer, or otherwise dispose of or encumber, or (B) agree to any changes
(including through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other
impairment of, Purchaser's or any of its Affiliates' or Subsidiaries' ability

(d) No party hereto shall, and each party hereto shall cause its Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly take any action, including directly or
indirectly acquiring or investing in any Person or acquiring, leasing or
licensing any assets, or agreeing to do any of the foregoing, if doing so
would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the satisfaction of any of
the conditions set forth in Sections 3.1(c), 3.1(d), 3.2(c) and 3.2(d) to be
satisfied or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

None of the parties hereto shall (i) extend any waiting period under the HSR
Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law or (ii) enter into any agreement
with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, except, in each case, with the prior written consent of
the other parties to this Agreement (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

occur of the Closing and the date that this Agreement is terminated in

4.7 Schedule Updates.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, the Company shall disclose to
Purchaser in writing (in the form of an updated schedule hereto), promptly
upon discovery thereof, any variances from the representations and warranties
contained in Article 5 hereof (each, a "Schedule Update") resulting from any
matter existing or arising prior to the date of this Agreement that was
required to be but was not previously set forth in any of the schedules hereto
(each such matter, an "Existing Matter").

(b) To the extent of the Existing Matter(s) disclosed in a Schedule Update:
(i) such Schedule Update shall not amend or supplement the schedules hereto
delivered on the date of this Agreement; (ii) subject to Section 4.7(c), such
Schedule Update shall not affect or limit the termination rights of Purchaser
set forth in Section 7.1; (iii) such Schedule Update shall not be taken into
consideration for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in
Section 3.2(a) or Section 3.2(b) have been satisfied; (iv) such Schedule
Update shall not affect or limit the indemnification obligations of the
Company Unitholders under Section 9.2; and (v) accordingly the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
9.2 (subject to the applicable limitations, if any, set forth in Section 9.5)
for any breaches of or inaccuracies in any of the representations and
warranties contained in Article 5 that otherwise would have existed but for
the Existing Matter(s) being disclosed pursuant to such Schedule Update.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Existing Matter underlying any
Schedule Update would give rise to Purchaser's right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(b) and Purchaser does not terminate
this Agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days following the first date on
which Purchaser's right to terminate this Agreement under Section 7.1(b)
arises, then Purchaser's right to terminate this Agreement in respect of such
Existing Matter shall be irrevocably waived.

4.8 Section 280G. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company
will use prompt and commercially reasonable efforts (which efforts shall not,
for clarity, include the requirement to offer or provide any additional value
or any other financial accommodation to any Person) to obtain waivers and
solicit shareholder approval of any payments that may, separately or in the
aggregate, constitute "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) that may be made to individuals who are
"disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code
and the regulations thereunder) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, such that such payments would not be deemed to
constitute "excess parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code;
provided that, for clarity, Company shall not be in breach of this covenant
solely as a result of the refusal of any disqualified individual to waive the
applicable payments and submit them to the applicable stockholder vote and/or
as a result of the requisite shareholder approval not to be obtained;
provided, that the Company shall immediately notify Purchaser of either such
circumstance. The Company will provide drafts of the waiver, disclosure and
consent documentation associated with the foregoing at least seven (7)
calendar days prior to the intended dissemination thereof and will consider in
good faith any comments of Purchaser thereto that are provided to the Company
at least one (1) calendar day prior to such intended dissemination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any contract,


 

--- 
| | 

|

37 

agreement, or plan is or is contemplated to be entered into by Purchaser, the
Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates and a disqualified individual who
has been identified to Purchaser as such in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement before the Closing Date (the "Purchaser
Arrangements"), which may reasonably constitute or require a payment to such
disqualified individual that is contingent upon a change in control within the
meaning the Section 280G of the Code, Purchaser shall provide a copy of such
contract, agreement or plan to the Company and the Sellers' Representative at
least fifteen (15) days before the Closing Date and shall cooperate with the
Company in good faith in order to calculate or determine the value (for the
purposes of Section 280G of the Code) of any payments or benefits granted or
contemplated therein, which may be paid or granted in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that could constitute a "parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code; provided that, in any event, the
Company's failure to include any Purchaser Arrangements which are not
communicated to the Company prior to the intended dissemination of the
disclosure and consent documentation in the stockholder voting materials
described herein will not result in a breach of the covenants set forth in
this Section 4.8.

4.9 Financing.

(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser
shall use, and shall cause the Subsidiaries of Purchaser to use, their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary or
advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment
Letter and satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing
of the Marketing Period) all conditions to the Financing in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements to be entered into pursuant
thereto, to the extent applicable to or within the control of Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries (other than any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is
a direct result of the Company Group's failure to provide the cooperation
described in Section 4.1(i)), (ii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive
agreements with respect to such Financing on the terms contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter or otherwise no less favorable to Purchaser and Merger Sub
than the terms and conditions (including the "flex" provisions) contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, (iii) comply with its
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter, including to satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions precedent to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter and
such definitive agreements thereto and to consummate the Financing at or prior
to the Closing, (iv) in the event that the conditions to Closing under this
Agreement and the conditions to the availability of the Financing under the
Debt Commitment Letter are satisfied, obtain a sufficient amount of the
Financing to enable Purchaser and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (v) if appropriate and practical under the
circumstances and available sources of cash are not otherwise available to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein, enforce its rights under the
Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter. Purchaser and Merger Sub shall keep
Sellers' Representative and the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and
provide the Company with copies of all executed definitive agreements related
to the Financing. Subject to the terms and upon satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Debt Financing Sources to
provide the Financing on

the Closing Date. In the event any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, and such
portion is reasonably required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including without limitation, to pay the Final Merger
Consideration, the Repaid Indebtedness, the Final Sellers' Transaction
Expenses and all other fees and expenses and other payment obligations
required to be paid by Purchaser and Merger Sub in connection with this
Agreement, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall (A) promptly notify Sellers'
Representative and the Company and (B) use their commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange to obtain Alternative Financing in an amount at least equal
to the amount of such portion, upon terms and conditions not materially less
favorable to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries than the terms and conditions set

required to consummate the transactions contemplated in the Agreement, or (c)
otherwise amends, modifies or waives, any provision of the Debt Commitment
Letter in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or
adversely affect the ability of the Purchaser or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise delay, hinder or make
less likely the occurrence of the Closing or adversely impact the ability of
Purchaser or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Commitment Letter or other definitive agreements related thereto (provided,
that Purchaser or Merger Sub may replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter
to add lenders, underwriters, lead arrangers, bookrunners, initial purchasers,

including using their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
Alternative Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions
with terms and conditions not materially less favorable (taken as a whole) to

forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and which would not reasonably be expected
to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Financing or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) no such amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification shall result in additional or
expanded covenants of the Sellers or the Company Group, and (iv) references to
the "Financing" (and other like terms in this Agreement) shall be deemed to
include such Alternative Financing, or the Financing as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified.

(c) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Sellers,
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives
pursuant to this Section 4.9 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the

or other reasonable and customary confidentiality undertakings in respect of
transactions similar to that contemplated by the Financing or any Alternative
Financing and of which the Company is a third party beneficiary.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any
failure to obtain any Financing (or any Alternative Financing) nor any failure
to fund any Financing (or any Alternative Financing) relieve Purchaser or
Merger Sub of any obligation under or in respect of this Agreement, including
the obligation to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as required hereby, and neither the obtaining nor the availability
or funding of any Financing (or any Alternative Financing) shall constitute a
condition to Purchaser's or Merger Sub's obligation to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required hereby. Each of
Purchaser and Merger Sub reaffirms its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of
the availability of the Financing (or any Alternative Financing), subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 3.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Section 4.9 shall require, and in no event shall the
commercially reasonable efforts of Purchaser or Merger Sub be deemed or
construed to require, Purchaser or Merger Sub to, in connection with
Alternative Financing, pay any fees or any interest rates applicable to the
Financing in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or
the market flex provisions in the Fee Letter), or agree to any market flex
term less favorable to Purchaser or Merger Sub, taken as a whole, than such
corresponding market flex term contained in or contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter (in either case, whether to secure waiver
of any conditions contained therein or otherwise).

6.7 Financing. Purchaser has provided to the Company true, correct and
complete copies of the fully executed commitment letter, dated as of the date
hereof, among Purchaser's indirect parent, Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc., and
the Debt Financing Sources party thereto, including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments to such letter in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letter") pursuant to which the
Debt Financing Sources party thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, to provide debt financing
to Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter, and the related fee letter (the "Fee Letter")
(provided, that provisions in the Fee Letter related to fees, pricing,
economic "flex" terms, thresholds, caps and other items not affecting
conditionality, availability or the amount of the Financing that would
otherwise be available to Purchaser and Merger Sub have been redacted) from
the Debt Financing Sources. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt

modified in any respect, and the Purchaser has not entered into any side
letters or other agreements or arrangements related to the Financing, other
than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the related Fee Letter,
(a) which would impose conditions or other contingencies to or could affect
the availability or funding of the full amount of the Financing or (b)
prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any Person from providing or seeking to

|

63 

Commitment Letter to make the full amount of the Financing available to
Purchaser and Merger Sub on the terms and conditions specified therein are not
subject to any conditions precedent or other contingencies other than as set
forth therein and, as of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter is in full force and effect and is the legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Purchaser and Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of
the Purchaser, each of the other parties thereto. Each of Purchaser and Merger
Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees that are required
to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letter on or prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub has reason to believe that it will
be unable to satisfy any term or condition to be satisfied by it as a
condition to the availability of the Financing contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter (and the payment of all associated costs and expenses) or
that the Financing will not be made available to Purchaser or Merger Sub at
the Closing, and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or
breach or failure to satisfy a condition on the part of Purchaser or Merger
Sub (or to the Purchaser's knowledge, any other party thereto) under the Debt
Commitment Letter or would otherwise be reasonably likely to result in any
portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable, other than
any such default, breach or failure that has been irrevocably waived by the
parties providing the Financing or otherwise cured in a timely manner by
Purchaser or Merger Sub to the satisfaction of such parties providing the
Financing. Purchaser and Merger Sub will have on the Closing Date sufficient
unrestricted cash on hand and available financing arrangements to pay all
amounts required to be paid by Purchaser and Merger Sub at the Closing
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to pay all of its related fees
and expenses. Neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub has reason to believe that such
available cash shall not be available or that the debt shall not be funded,
and neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub has made any misrepresentation in
connection with obtaining such debt financing commitments. In no event shall
the receipt by, or the availability of any funds or financing to, Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates or any other financing be a condition to Purchaser's or
Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder.

6.8 Solvency. Assuming (a) that the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material
respects as of the Closing, (b) each member of the Company Group has complied
with all pre-Closing covenants and agreements herein and (c) the financial
condition of each member of the Company Group has not changed in any material
respect since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, immediately after the
Closing, after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each member of the Company Group will be Solvent. For purposes of
this Section 6.8, "Solvent" means that, with respect to any Person and as of
any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "present fair saleable value"
of the assets of such Person, will, as of such date, exceed the amount of all
"liabilities of such Person, contingent or otherwise," as of such date, as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, (ii) the
present fair saleable value of the assets of such Person will, as of such
date, be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the liabilities
of such Person on its indebtedness as its indebtedness becomes absolute and
matured, (iii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably
small amount of capital with which to conduct its business and (iv) such
Person will be able to pay its indebtedness as it matures. For purposes of the
foregoing definition only,

"indebtedness" means a liability in connection with another Person's (x) right
to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated,
unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
legal, equitable, secured or unsecured or (y) right to any equitable remedy
for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right of payment,
whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or
unsecured.

6.9 Disclaimer. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither
Purchaser nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty, express or
implied, at law or in equity and any such other representations or warranties
are hereby expressly disclaimed. Without limiting the generality or the
foregoing, neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub shall be deemed to make to any
Company Unitholder or any member of the Company Group any representation or
warranty other than as expressly made by such Person in this Agreement.
Nothing in this Section 6.9 shall prohibit, restrict or otherwise limit any
Action by a Company Unitholder hereunder in respect of actual and intentional
fraud in the making of any of the representations and warranties in this
Article 6.

officers or employees and even though Sellers' Counsel may have represented a
member of the Company Group in a matter substantially related to such dispute,
and Purchaser, the Company and their respective Affiliates hereby waive, on
behalf of themselves and each of their Affiliates, any conflict of interest in
connection with such representation by Sellers' Counsel and agree not to seek
to have Sellers' Counsel disqualified from representing the Sellers'
Representative or any of its Affiliates in connection with such dispute. Each
of Purchaser and the Company further agrees that, as to all pre-Closing
communications among Sellers' Counsel, any member of the Company Group, any
Company Unitholder and any of their respective Affiliates, directors,
managers, officers or employees to the extent related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation
of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong
to Sellers' Representative and its Affiliates, as applicable, and may be
controlled by Sellers' Representative and its Affiliates and shall not pass to
or be claimed by Purchaser, the Company Group, any Company Unitholder or any
of their respective Affiliates, directors, managers, officers or employees.
Purchaser further agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that all
communications that occurred prior to the Closing in any form or format
whatsoever between or among any of Sellers' Counsel, the Company Group, the
Company Unitholders, the Sellers' Representative (and its Affiliates) and each
of their respective directors, officers, employees and other Representatives
that relate to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute arising under this
Agreement (collectively, the "Deal Communications") shall be deemed to be
retained and owned collectively by the Sellers' Representative, shall be
controlled by the Sellers' Representative and


 

--- 
| | 

|

69 

shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or the Company or their
respective Affiliates. All Deal Communications that are attorney-client
privileged (the "Privileged Deal Communications") shall remain privileged
after the Closing. To the extent that files in respect of any Privileged Deal
Communications constitute property of the client, the privilege and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the
Sellers' Representative and its Affiliates, shall be controlled by the
Sellers' Representatives and its Affiliates and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Purchaser or the Company or their respective Affiliates.

(g) Each Company Unitholder (including in each case for purposes of this
Section 8.6(g), the Sellers' Representative) agrees that Purchaser, and
following the Closing, the Surviving Company and each other member of the
Company Group, shall be entitled to rely on any action authorized by this
Section 8.6 or any Letter of Transmittal to be taken by the Sellers'
Representative, on behalf of each Company Unitholder (each, an "Authorized
Action"), and that each Authorized Action shall be binding on each Company
Unitholder as fully as if such Company Unitholder had taken such Authorized
Action. Each Company Unitholder agrees to pay, and to indemnify and hold
harmless, each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any
Losses which they may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as a result of any
claim by any Person that an Authorized Action is not binding on, or
enforceable against, such Company Unitholder. In addition, each Company
Unitholder hereby releases and discharges each of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties and, following the Closing, the Surviving Company and each other
member of the Company Group, from and against any Losses arising out of or in
connection with the Sellers' Representative's failure (other than to the
extent arising out of any action taken by or at the written direction of any
Purchaser Indemnified Party that is inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement) to distribute any amounts received by the Sellers' Representative
on behalf of the Company Unitholders to the Company Unitholders. Payment of
all amounts paid by or on behalf of Purchaser (whether directly or through any
escrowed funds of any kind) to the Sellers' Representative shall constitute
payment by Purchaser to each of the Company Unitholders and satisfaction of
Purchaser's obligation to pay such amount hereunder (notwithstanding any
withholding (including in the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund) by the
Sellers' Representative).

8.7 Directors and Officers Insurance.

(a) From and after the Closing until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, to the extent of coverage actually provided under the DandO Tail
Policy, Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to any Person who is
on the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer,
director or manager of any member of the Company Group (each such Person, a
"DandO Beneficiary"), officers' and directors' liability insurance coverage
("DandO Insurance") with respect to all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs and expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation (each, a "DandO Claim") to the
extent that any such DandO Claim is based on, or arises out of, the fact that
such DandO Beneficiary is or was a manager, director or officer of any member of
the Company Group at any time prior to the Closing Date or is or was serving
at the request of any member of the Company Group as a manager, director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at any time prior to the
Closing Date, in each case to the extent


 

--- 
| | 

|

70 

that any such DandO Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising, existing, or
occurring prior to or at the Closing, regardless of whether such DandO Claim is
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date.

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall coordinate the purchase of a
"tail" policy for the existing DandO Insurance of the Company Group that shall
provide for (x) an overall coverage amount not less than the overall coverage
amount under the existing DandO Insurance of the Company Group as in effect on
the date hereof and (y) coverage for liability under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act in amounts not less than the coverage amounts for such
liabilities under the existing DandO Insurance of the Company Group as in effect
on the date hereof (the "DandO Tail Policy"). Until the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Company (i) not to
terminate the DandO Tail Policy, (ii) not to amend or otherwise modify the DandO
Tail Policy or take any action that would result in the cancellation,
termination, amendment or modification of the DandO Tail Policy and (iii) to
continue to honor its obligations under the DandO Tail Policy.

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not,
and shall not permit any member of the Company Group (including the Surviving
Company) to, amend, repeal or modify (in a manner adverse to the beneficiary
thereof) any provision in such Person's Organizational Documents relating to
the exculpation or indemnification of, or advancement of expenses to, any
officers, directors or managers, it being the intent of the parties hereto
that the officers, directors and managers of the Company Group on the date
hereof shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and
advancement to the full extent of Applicable Law, but subject to any
qualifications or limitations provided for under the Organizational Documents
of the applicable member of the Company Group as in effect on the date hereof.
The provisions of this Section 8.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, each DandO Beneficiary and such Person's estate, heirs and
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
pursuant to Applicable Law, the Organizational Documents of any member of the
Company Group in effect as of the date hereof or any contract in effect as of
the date hereof.

8.8 Tax Matters.

(a) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the Company Group which are filed after the Closing
Date for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and for any
Straddle Period. No later than forty-five (45) days prior to filing any such
Tax Return, Purchaser shall submit such Tax Return to the Sellers'
Representative for its review, comment, and consent. Purchaser shall make any
revisions as are reasonably requested by Sellers' Representative. The parties
hereto agree that any Tax Return of the applicable member of the Company Group
that includes the Closing Date shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, reflect, without limitation, any Transaction Tax Deductions.

(b) Purchaser and its Affiliates (including on or after the Closing Date, the
Company Group) shall not file, or cause to be filed, any restatement or
amendment of, modification to, or claim for refund relating to, any Tax Return
of any member of the Company Group for any taxable period that begins prior to
the Closing Date (regardless of whether such taxable period ends


 

--- 
| | 

|

71 

prior to the Closing Date) without the prior written consent of the Sellers'
Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) Cooperation; Procedures Relating to Tax Claims. Subject to the other
provisions of this Section 8.8, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with (i) the filing of Tax Returns, (ii) any Action with
respect to Taxes and Tax Returns and (iii) the preparation of any financial
statements to the extent related to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention, and (upon the other party's request) the provision, of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Action and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder; provided, that
the party requesting assistance shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket fees
and expenses incurred by the party providing such assistance; provided,
further, no party shall be required to provide assistance at times or in
amounts that would interfere unreasonably with the business and operations of
such party.

(d) No party hereto nor any Affiliate thereof shall make an election under
Section 336 or Section 338 of the Code or any similar provision of Law in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Purchaser shall not take any action or cause any action to be taken with
respect to the Company Group or the Surviving Company subsequent to the
Closing that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby to constitute
part of a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the
"Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service
Notice 2001-16, 2001-1 C.B. 730, and Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-20
I.R.B. 2008-6 (January 17, 2008), and Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-111
I.R.B. 1299 (December 1, 2008).

(f) Tax Contests.

(i) Purchaser shall deliver a written notice to the Sellers' Representative in
writing promptly following the commencement of any Action with respect to
Taxes of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries for which the Company
Unitholders may be liable ("Tax Contest") and shall describe in reasonable
detail (to the extent known by Purchaser) the facts constituting the basis for
such Tax Contest, the nature of the relief sought, and the amount of the
claimed losses (including Taxes), if any (the "Tax Claim Notice"); provided,
however, that the failure or delay to so notify the Sellers' Representative
shall not relieve the Company Unitholders of any obligation or liability that
the Company Unitholders may have to Purchaser, except to the extent that the
Company Unitholders demonstrate that the Company Unitholders are adversely
prejudiced thereby.

(ii) With respect to Tax Contests for Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period), the
Sellers' Representative may elect to assume and control the defense of such
Tax Contest by written notice to Purchaser within thirty (30) days after
delivery by Purchaser to the Sellers' Representative of the Tax Claim Notice.
If the Sellers' Representative elects to assume and control the defense of


 

--- 
| | 

|

72 

such Tax Contest, the Sellers' Representative (A) shall bear its own costs and
expenses, (B) shall be entitled to engage its own counsel and (C) may (1)
pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, litigation, proceedings,
hearings and conferences with any taxing authority, (2) either pay the Tax
claimed or sue for refund where Applicable Law permits such refund suit or (3)
contest, settle or compromise the Tax Contest in any permissible manner;
provided, however, that the Sellers' Representative shall not settle or
compromise (or take other actions described herein with respect to) any Tax
Contest without the prior written consent of Purchaser (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such settlement or
compromise would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Tax liability
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including any of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date. If the
Sellers' Representative elects to assume the defense of any Tax Contest, the
Sellers' Representative shall (x) keep Purchaser reasonably informed of all
material developments and events relating to such Tax Contest (including
promptly forwarding copies to Purchaser of any related correspondence, and
shall provide Purchaser with an opportunity to review and comment on any
material correspondence before the Sellers' Representative sends such
correspondence to any taxing authority), (y) consult with Purchaser in
connection with the defense or prosecution of any such Tax Contest and (z)
provide such cooperation and information as Purchaser shall reasonably
request, and Purchaser shall have the right to participate in (but not
control) the defense of such Tax Contest (including participating in any
discussions with the applicable tax authorities regarding such Tax Contests).

(iii) In connection with any Tax Contest that relates to Taxes of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle
Period) that (A) the Sellers' Representative does not timely elect to control
pursuant to Section 8.8(f)(ii) or (B) the Sellers' Representative fails to
diligently defend, such Tax Contest shall be controlled by Purchaser (and the
Sellers' Representative shall reimburse Purchaser for all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by Purchaser relating to a Tax Contest described in this
Section 8.8(f)(iii)) and the Sellers' Representative agrees to cooperate with
Purchaser in pursuing such Tax Contest.

(iv) In connection with any Tax Contest for Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period, such Tax Contest shall be controlled by
Purchaser; provided, that with respect to any Tax Contest described in Section
(iii) or in this Section (iv), Purchaser shall not (1) forego any
administrative appeals, litigation, proceedings, hearings and conferences with
any taxing authority, (2) pay the Tax claimed or (3) settle or compromise (or
take such other actions described herein with respect to) any such Tax Contest
without the prior written consent of the Sellers' Representative, such consent
not to be unreasonable withheld, conditioned or delayed. Purchaser shall (A)
keep the Sellers' Representative informed of all material developments and
events relating to such Tax Contest (including promptly forwarding copies to
the Sellers' Representative of any related correspondence and shall provide
the Sellers' Representative with an opportunity to review and comment on any
material correspondence before Purchaser sends such correspondence to any
taxing authority), (B) consult with the Sellers' Representative in connection
with the defense or prosecution of any such Tax Contest and (C) provide such
cooperation and


 

--- 
| | 

|

73 

information as the Sellers' Representative shall reasonably request and the
Sellers' Representative shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in (but not control) the defense of such Tax Contest (including
participating in any discussions with the applicable tax authorities regarding
such Tax Contests).

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
procedures for all Tax Contests shall be governed exclusively by this Section
8.8(f) (and not Section 9.7(a)).

(g) Any refunds of Taxes (including, without limitation, estimated Taxes) with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are received by Purchaser or the
Company Group after the Closing Date (any such refund, a "Pre-Closing Tax
Refund"), shall be for the account of the Company Unitholders, and the Company
shall pay over to the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit of the Company
Unitholders) any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund within ten (10) days after
receipt thereof, provided however that any refunds (i) attributable to a
carryback from any taxable year beginning after the Closing Date or (ii) taken
into account as an asset in the calculation of the Final Working Capital shall
be for the account of Purchaser. Purchaser and the Company Group shall
cooperate with the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the Company
Unitholders) in obtaining such refunds, it being understood that (A) Purchaser
and the Company Group will carryback any net operating losses for taxable
periods ending on or before or including the Closing Date to prior taxable
periods as allowable by applicable Tax Law and shall claim Tax refunds as a
result of such carryback (including through the filing of amended Tax
Returns), (B) any such Pre-Closing Tax Refunds will be claimed in cash rather
than as a credit against future Tax liabilities, (C) Purchaser and the Company
Group shall cooperate with the Representative in preparing and filing Tax
Returns (including amendments of prior Tax Returns and claims for refunds,
including claims for refunds on IRS Forms 1139 and/or 4466) for any taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and for any Straddle Period as
promptly as reasonably possible, and (D) to the extent Pre-Closing Tax Refunds
are reduced because of the inability to close the tax year of any member of
the Company Group on the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall pay over to the
Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the Company Unitholders) the amount of
such reduction within ten (10) days of the filing of the Tax Return for the
applicable Straddle Period.

(h) To the extent that Purchaser or any of its Affiliates recognizes a
Transaction Tax Benefit (as defined below) in either of the first two (2)
taxable years ending after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay the amount of
such Transaction Tax Benefits to the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the
Company Unitholders) as such Transaction Tax Benefits are actually recognized
by Purchaser (or its Affiliate) within ten (10) days of filing any Tax Return
for each such taxable year. For this purpose, a "Transaction Tax Benefit"
means any reduction in Purchaser's or any member of the Company Group's
liability for Taxes resulting from (i) the carryforward of any net operating
loss arising in a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (ii) any Transaction Tax
Deductions to the extent not included as deductions in the Tax Returns of the
Company Group for the taxable period that ends on the Closing Date. Purchaser
or its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Group)
shall be deemed to recognize a Transaction Tax Benefit with respect to a
taxable year if, and to the extent that, such party's cumulative liability for
Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by excluding the
relevant net operating loss carryforwards and/or


 

--- 
| | 

|

74 

Transaction Tax Deductions from all taxable years, exceeds such party's actual
cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year,
calculated by taking into account such net operating loss carryforwards and/or
Transaction Tax Deductions for all taxable years (to the extent permitted by
relevant Tax Law and treating such net operating loss carryforwards and
Transaction Tax Deductions as the last items claimed for any taxable year).
Within fifteen (15) days of the filing of any income Tax Return of the Company
Group with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) that begins
after the Closing Date and takes into account any such net operating loss
carryforwards or Transaction Tax Deduction, Purchaser shall deliver to the
Sellers' Representative a schedule setting forth in reasonable detail the
amount and calculation of any Transaction Tax Benefit realized during such
taxable year.

(i) Any payments (including indemnification payments under this Section 8.8
and Article 9) under this Agreement (other than payments of the Aggregate
Initial Consideration) shall be treated by all parties hereto as adjustments
to the Aggregate Initial Consideration.

8.9 Employee Matters. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the
applicable members of the Company Group to pay to the applicable Service
Providers bonuses and other cash incentive amounts earned in respect of the
Company's fiscal year 2016 consistent with terms of the applicable Employee
Plans (copies of which have been provided to Purchaser) in effect as of the
date hereof, in each case, to the extent such amounts have been accrued on the
Latest Balance Sheet or included in the determination of Final Working
Capital. Such amounts shall be paid in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and the terms of the applicable Employee Plans,
including in respect of timing and amount.

8.10 Certain Indemnity Proceeds. In the event that any member of the Company
Group receives any payment in satisfaction of the indemnification claims
listed on the "Indemnity Claims Schedule" from the indemnitor therefor (and
not, for the avoidance of doubt, from any other third party, including any
insurer), whether directly from such indemnitor or by recourse to any funds
held in escrow to satisfy such payment obligations, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause a member of the Company Group to, promptly and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days of the receipt thereof, pay such amount to the Sellers'
Representative (or, at the Sellers' Representative's direction, pay to the
Paying Agent), less the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Purchaser, any member of the Company Group, or any of
their respective Affiliates in procuring such collection and recovery, for
further distribution to the Company Unitholders in accordance with their
respective Applicable Percentages. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the applicable members of the Company Group to use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect all amounts in respect thereof, not waive in any
material respect the right to recover and collect any such amount, and upon,
written request from the Sellers' Representative, timely provide periodic
updates with respect to such efforts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this Section 8.10 shall require Purchaser, any member of the Company Group
or any of their respective Affiliates to institute or file any lawsuit or
other legal proceeding against any such indemnitor unless the Company
Unitholders irrevocably agree in writing to be responsible for all fees,
costs, and expenses incurred by Purchaser, any member of the Company Group or
any of their respective Affiliates in connection with such lawsuit or other
legal proceeding.

respective Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders,
equityholders, partners, members, managers, employees, advisors, agents and

Parties") against, and hold them harmless from, any and all Losses suffered or

be performed by Purchaser or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

9.4 Indemnifiable Losses. All Losses for which the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties are entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 are
referred to herein as "Purchaser Indemnifiable Losses." All Losses for which
the Company Unitholder Indemnified Parties are entitled to seek
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.3 are referred to herein as "Company
Unitholder Indemnifiable Losses." Purchaser Indemnifiable Losses and Company
Unitholder Indemnifiable Losses are collectively referred to herein as
"Indemnifiable Losses."

9.5 Certain Limitations. The indemnification obligations of the parties hereto
provided for in Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 are subject to the following
limitations:

(a) No Company Unitholder shall be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party
for indemnification under Section 9.2(a) until the aggregate amount of all
Purchaser Indemnifiable Losses in respect of indemnification under Section
9.2(a) exceeds Four Million One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand ($4,125,000) (the
"Basket"), in which event the Company Unitholders (pro rata based on their
respective Applicable Percentages) shall be required to pay and shall be
liable for all such Purchaser Indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Basket;
provided, however, that the limitations in this Section 9.5(a) shall not apply
to any claims of actual and intentional fraud.

(b) The aggregate liability of the Company Unitholders to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any Purchaser Indemnifiable
Losses arising under Section 9.2 shall not, in any event, exceed Four Million
One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand ($4,125,000) (the "Cap"); provided, however,
that the Cap shall not apply to any claims of actual and intentional fraud;

Merger Consideration hereunder.

(c) Any indemnification under Section 9.2 for Losses in respect of breaches of
the representations in Section 5.18 (other than in Sections 5.18(g), (h), (j),
and (k)) shall be limited to such Losses incurred with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period.

77 

(d) Neither a party's good faith judgment as to whether a matter meets a
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" threshold under a representation or
warranty qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, respectively,
nor a party's good faith estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of
financial statements shall be considered fraud for the purposes of this
Agreement (provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be construed, in
and of itself, to impute fraud to any Person merely by reason of the fact that
it is alleged that such Person did not act in good faith).

9.6 [Reserved].

9.7 Procedures Relating to Indemnification. As used herein, an "Indemnified
Party" shall refer to a Purchaser Indemnified Party or a Company Unitholder
Indemnified Party, as applicable; provided, that, with respect to any actions
to be taken by an Indemnified Party under this Section 9.7, "Indemnified
Party" shall mean Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the
Company Unitholders, as applicable, and the "Indemnifying Party" shall refer
to the party obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party. Except to the
extent doing so would be prohibited by the terms of the RandW Policy relating to
any claim made by a Purchaser Indemnified Party, all claims for
indemnification by an Indemnified Party under Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, as
applicable (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not apply to claims
made under the RandW Policy or after the Claim Deadline), shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

(a) Third Party Claims.

(i) In the event that any Indemnified Party is made a party to or otherwise
becomes subject to any Action instituted by any third party for which the
liability or the costs or expenses of which are Losses for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Party under this Article 9
(other than any Tax Contest, the procedures for which shall be governed
exclusively by Section 8.8(f)) (any such third party Action being referred to
herein as a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such
written notice shall not affect the Indemnified Party's rights under this
Article 9 except to the extent such failure has materially and adversely
affected the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to contest and defend such Third
Party Claim at its sole cost and expense so long as (A) the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party, within ten (10) Business Days after the
Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim to the
Indemnifying Party (or by such earlier date as may be necessary under
applicable procedural rules in order to file a timely appearance and response)
that the Indemnifying Party is assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim
and that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party from and
against all Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer or incur resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by, such Third Party
Claim, (B) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party has
and is reasonably likely at all times to continue to have the financial
resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its
indemnification obligations hereunder with respect thereto, (C) the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third

Party Claim actively and diligently, (D) the Third Party Claim (1) does not
seek injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief as the
primary remedy, (2) has not been brought by any Governmental Authority, and
does not allege any criminal allegations, (3) is not one in which the
Indemnifying Party is also a party and, in the opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnified
Party which are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party, or (4) does not involve a claim which, upon petition by
the Indemnified Party, the appropriate Governmental Authority rules that the
Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend, and
(E) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party
Claim is not reasonably likely to be adverse in any material respect to the
Indemnified Party's relationships with its current customers, suppliers, or
other Persons having a material business relationship with the Indemnified
Party.

(ii) The Indemnified Party shall be entitled at any time, at its own cost and
expense (which cost and expense shall not constitute a Loss unless such cost
and expense is incurred at the request of the Indemnifying Party), to
participate in such contest and defense and to be represented by attorneys of
its own choosing; provided, however, that if the claim for indemnification is
resolved in favor of the Indemnified Party (in whole or in part), the
Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of
counsel retained by the Indemnified Party that are incurred prior to the
Indemnifying Party's assumption of control of the defense of the Third Party
Claim pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. If the Indemnified Party
elects to participate in such defense, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party in the conduct of such defense of such Third Party
Claim. The Indemnifying Party may not consent to entry of judgment in, or
settle or compromise, any Third Party Claim, the defense of which the
Indemnifying Party is conducting pursuant to this Section 9.7(a), without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, unless such judgment,
compromise or settlement (A) includes a full unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party(ies) from all liabilities and obligations relating to such
Third Party Claim, (B) does not contain any finding or admission of wrongdoing
or any violation of any Law or the rights of any Person by the Indemnified
Party and has no effect on any other Actions that may be asserted against the
Indemnified Party and (C) provides for the payment of money, solely by the
Indemnifying Party from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as the sole relief for the
claimant in such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event the Indemnifying Party fails to provide the notice contemplated by
clause (A) of Section 9.7(a)(i) within the timeframe specified therein, the
Indemnified Party may defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to, the Third Party
Claim, at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party will not be bound by the entry of any such judgment
consented to, or any such compromise or settlement effected, without its prior
written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the insurer(s) under the RandW
Policy and its/their agents and advisors shall be permitted to consult and
associate with any party in the defense of any Third Party Claim that may
reasonably constitute a "Loss" or similar concept under the RandW Policy and
nothing in this Section 9.7(a) shall

|

79 

modify or be deemed to modify the relevant claim and claim handling process
between Purchaser and its insurer(s) under the terms of the RandW Policy.

(b) Direct Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim (a
"Direct Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver written notice
of such Direct Claim to the Indemnifying Party, which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the amount or an estimate of the amount of the liability
arising therefrom and the basis therefor, in each case to the extent then
known. The failure to give such written notice shall not affect the
Indemnified Party's rights hereunder except to the extent such failure has
materially and adversely affected the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend
such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party (i) notifies the Indemnified
Party within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice of a Direct Claim that it
agrees with the Direct Claim described in such notice or (ii) fails to notify
the Indemnified Party within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice of a
Direct Claim that it disputes the Direct Claim described in such notice, then,
in either case, the Loss(es) in the amount specified in the Indemnified
Party's notice shall be deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with the terms herein, and payment thereof shall be made to the
Indemnified Party promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days
thereafter). If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within
sixty (60) days after receipt of notice of a Direct Claim that it disputes the
Direct Claim described in such notice, then the Indemnified Party may pursue
its remedies hereunder with respect thereto.

9.8 Determination of Losses.

(a) The amount of any Indemnifiable Loss payable under this Article 9 by an
Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party from insurance policies (other than proceeds from the RandW
Policy) or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for such
Indemnifiable Loss (the "Alternative Arrangements"), in each case net of the
following (collectively, the "Collection Expenses"): (i) reasonable and
documented costs and expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates in procuring such recovery, (ii) any retro-premium obligations,
increases in premiums or premium adjustments to the extent attributable to
such recovery, and (iii) deductibles and other amounts incurred in connection
with such recovery. If, subsequent to an indemnification payment made by an
Indemnifying Party for an Indemnifiable Loss, the Indemnified Party actually
receives any amounts under any Alternative Arrangements with respect to such
Indemnifiable Loss, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly (but in any
event within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such amounts under such
Alternative Arrangements) reimburse the Indemnifying Party for the
indemnification payment actually made to such Indemnified Party by such
Indemnifying Party for such Indemnifiable Loss up to the amount actually
received by the Indemnified Party under such Alternative Arrangements, in each
case, net of all associated Collection Expenses.

(b) Indemnification payments under this Article 9 shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party without reduction for any Tax Benefits available to the
Indemnified Party. However, to the extent that the Indemnified Party
recognizes Tax Benefits as a result of any Indemnifiable Losses in any tax
year in which or prior to which such Indemnifiable Losses were incurred (or in
the immediately succeeding two (2) taxable years), the Indemnified Party shall
pay


 

--- 
| | 

|

80 

the amount of such Tax Benefits (but not in excess of the indemnification
payment or payments actually received from the Indemnifying Party with respect
to such Indemnifiable Losses) to the Indemnifying Party as such Tax Benefits
are actually recognized by the Indemnified Party. For this purpose, an
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize a tax benefit (a "Tax Benefit")
with respect to a taxable year if, and to the extent that, the Indemnified
Party's cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year,
calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable to the Indemnifiable Losses
from all taxable years, exceeds the Indemnified Party's actual cumulative
liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking
into account any Tax items attributable to the Indemnifiable Losses for all
taxable years (to the extent permitted by relevant Tax Law and treating such
Tax items as the last items claimed for any taxable year).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Purchaser Indemnified Party will be entitled to indemnification under this
Article 9 for any Loss to the extent that it has been taken into account in
the final determination of Actual Working Capital, Actual Indebtedness or
Actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 2.10 hereof.

9.9 Mitigation. Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Indemnifiable Losses for which such Indemnified Party
seeks indemnification under this Article 9 to the extent required by
Applicable Law.

9.10 No Circular Recovery. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no Company Unitholder shall have any right of contribution against
Purchaser, the Surviving Company, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any Purchaser Indemnifiable
Losses. Each Company Unitholder agrees that he, she or it shall not make any
claim for indemnification against Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any
other member of the Company Group (following the Closing), any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Purchaser Indemnified Party by reason of
the fact that such Company Unitholder or any of his, her or its agents or
other Representatives was a controlling person, equityholder, director,
officer, manager, employee, agent or other Representative of any member of the
Company Group or was serving as such for another Person at the request of any
member of the Company Group (whether such claim is for losses of any kind or
otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant to any Law, Organizational
Document, contractual obligation or otherwise) with respect to any Purchaser
Indemnifiable Losses owed by such Company Unitholder pursuant to this Article
9.

9.11 Certain Determinations. For all purposes of this Article 9, each
representation and warranty in this Agreement shall be read without regard and
without giving effect to the term(s) "material" or "Material Adverse Effect"
or similar qualifiers as if such words and surrounding related words (e.g.,
"reasonably be expected to," "could have" and similar restrictions and
qualifiers) were deleted from such representation and warranty.

9.12 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and covenants of
the parties hereto, and an Indemnified Party's right to indemnification with
respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party (including by any
of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that such Indemnified Party
or any of its Representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of such
Indemnified Party's


 

--- 
| | 

|

81 

waiver of any condition set forth in Section 3.2(a), Section 3.2(b) or Section
3.2(b), as the case may be.

9.13 Exclusive Remedy; Source of Indemnification; RandW Policy.

(a) Following the Closing, the respective rights of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties and the Company Unitholder Indemnified Parties to indemnification
pursuant to this Article 9 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies available
to such parties with respect to any and all claims with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than
disputes under Section 2.10, which disputes under Section 2.10 shall be
resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in
Section 2.10). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing herein shall limit
or impair any party's right to obtain specific performance or other injunctive
relief with respect to any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement or
limit any Action hereunder in respect of actual and intentional fraud in the
making of any of the representations and warranties in Article 5, and (ii) the
limitations on remedies contained in this Section 9.13(a) shall not apply to
any of the other agreements, documents and instruments entered into by the
parties hereto in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) Subject to the other applicable provisions regarding indemnification
contained herein, if the Company Unitholders are obligated to reimburse or
compensate the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Purchaser Indemnifiable
Losses in connection with a claim for indemnification by any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties under Section 9.2, then indemnification for such Purchaser
Indemnifiable Losses shall, subject to the applicable limitations, if any, set
forth in Section 9.5, be satisfied solely from the then remaining balance of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

ARTICLE 10 

MISCELLANEOUS

10.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Effective Time and the Closing to the extent expressly
provided herein; provided, however, that any recourse by an Indemnified Party
against an Indemnifying Party pursuant to the rights of indemnification set
forth in Article 9 will be limited as set forth in Article 9. The covenants,
agreements and obligations of the parties contained herein to be performed
following the Closing shall survive the Effective Time and the Closing until
performed in accordance with the terms thereof, unless the covenant, agreement
or obligation specifies a term, in which case, such covenant, agreement or
obligation shall survive for such specified term (the date on which such
covenants, agreements or obligations terminate, the "Covenant Survival
Termination Date").

10.2 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended, altered or
modified except by a written instrument executed by Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the Company Unitholders, and prior to the
Closing, the Company). No course of dealing between or among any Persons
having any interest in this Agreement will be deemed effective to modify,
amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of
any Person

82 

under or by reason of this Agreement. No waiver of any of the provisions of
this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute, a waiver of any other
provisions, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a
continuing waiver. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Sections 10.8, 10.13 and 10.14 and this Section 10.2 (and any provision of
this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver or termination
of such provision would modify the substance of Sections 10.8, 10.13 and 10.14
and this Section 10.2) may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a
manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to the Debt Financing Sources
without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources party to the
Debt Commitment Letter on the date of this Agreement.

10.3 Notices. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered to Purchaser, the Company, the Sellers' Representative or any
Company Unitholder under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement will

10.4 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any
rights, benefits or obligations set forth herein may be assigned by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative, and any attempted assignment without such prior written
consent shall be void; provided, that Purchaser may transfer or assign (i) its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time, but no such transfer or
assignment shall affect, or relieve Purchaser from performing, its obligations
under this Agreement and (ii) as collateral security, its rights pursuant
hereto to any Person providing financing to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates.

10.5 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law,
but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid
under Applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of
such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

10.6 No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and the parties intend that no rule of strict construction will be
applied against any Person. The use of the word "including" in this Agreement
or in any of the agreements contemplated hereby shall be by way of example
rather than by limitation. Unless the context otherwise requires, any
reference to a "Section," "Exhibit," or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to
a section of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule to this
Agreement, as applicable. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

10.7 Captions. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and
construed as if no caption had been used in this Agreement.

10.8 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except with respect to each of the Debt
Financing Sources, who shall be third party beneficiaries of Sections 10.2,
10.13 and 10.14 and this Section 10.8, with respect to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, who shall be third party beneficiaries of Sections 8.6(g)
and Article 9, and as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement
(including as set forth in Section 8.7 above), (a) nothing herein expressed or
implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any
Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective

|

84 

permitted successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement, such third parties specifically including employees or
creditors of the Company Group, and (b) without limiting the generality of the
foregoing clause (a), each party hereto will not, and will not cause or permit
any other Person to, (i) assert any claim of any nature whatsoever arising
under or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation thereof or its subject
matter, or the transactions contemplated hereby or consummated or contemplated
to be consummated in connection herewith, against any Person other than the
other parties hereto (and against such parties only pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement), including against any past, present or future
direct or indirect equityholders, partners, members, managers, controlling
Persons, directors, officers, employees, incorporators, managers, members,
agents, other Representatives or Affiliates of any party hereto (or any
Affiliate of any of the foregoing), or the heirs, executors, administrators,
estates, successors or assigns of any of the foregoing (with respect to each
party hereto, such party's "Nonparty Affiliates") or (ii) without limiting the
generality of clause (i), hold or attempt to hold any of the Company's or the
Sellers' Representative's Nonparty Affiliates liable for any actual or alleged
inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions with respect to any information or
materials of any kind furnished by or on behalf of the Company, any other
member of the Company Group, the Sellers' Representatives, any of their
respective Nonparty Affiliates, or their respective agents or other
Representatives, concerning the Business, the Company Group, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or consummated or contemplated to be
consummated in connection herewith; provided, that the foregoing shall not
prohibit, restrict or otherwise limit any claim in respect of fraud.

10.9 Acknowledgment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each of Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees, on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates, that: (a) it has conducted, to its satisfaction,
an independent investigation of the condition (financial and otherwise),
results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected
operations of the Business and the Company Group and, in making its
determination to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transaction
contemplated hereby, it is relying only on the representations and warranties
of the Company expressly and specifically set forth in Article 5, (b) that (i)
neither the Company, any other member of the Company Group, the Sellers'
Representative nor any of their respective Nonparty Affiliates has made or
shall be deemed to have made, and Purchaser and Merger Sub have not relied on
and are not relying on, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
express or implied, with respect to the Business, the Company Group, the
subject matter of this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby, or
the accuracy or completeness of any information or materials regarding the
Business, the Company Group, the subject matter of this Agreement or the
transaction contemplated hereby, that have been furnished or made available to
Purchaser or Merger Sub or their representatives or any other Person, other
than the representations and warranties of the Company that are expressly set
forth in Article 5; (ii) neither the Company, the Sellers' Representative nor
any of their respective Nonparty Affiliates shall have or be subject to any
liability or obligation to Purchaser or Merger Sub or any other Person
resulting from or in connection with the dissemination to Purchaser or Merger
Sub or their representatives or any other Person or the use by Purchaser or
Merger Sub or their representatives or any other Person of any such
information or materials, including any information or materials made
available to Purchaser, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives in any "data room," management presentation or in any other
form in connection with or expectation of the entry into this Agreement


 

--- 
| | 

|

85 

or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) all other representations
and warranties of any kind or nature express or implied (including any
relating to the future or historical condition (financial or otherwise),
results of operations, assets or liabilities of the Business, the Company
Group, the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby) are expressly and specifically disclaimed by the Company and the
Sellers' Representative and have not been and are not being relied upon by
Purchaser or Merger Sub or any of their Representatives or Affiliates in
entering into this Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

10.10 Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the
rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any party, money damages could be inadequate and the non-
breaching party would have no adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly, the parties
agree that such non-breaching party shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in its favor at law or in equity, to
enforce its rights and the other parties' obligations hereunder not only by an
action or actions for damages but also by seeking an action or actions for
specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without
posting of bond or other security or alleging or proving insufficiency of
damages).

10.11 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the agreements and documents
referred to herein contain the complete agreement among the parties hereto and
supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among
the parties, written or oral, which relate to the subject matter hereof in any
way.

10.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, any one of which may be by facsimile, e-mail of a ".pdf"
counterpart, or other electronic communication, and all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

10.13 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware. To the extent permitted by Law, each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits and consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located in
Wilmington, Delaware (or, if such courts shall not have jurisdiction, any
United States federal court sitting in the State of Delaware), and, in each
case, appellate courts therefrom, over any suit, action or other proceeding
brought by any party arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees that all
claims with respect to any such suit, action or other proceeding shall be
heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to
the extent permitted by law, in such federal such court and (b) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or other proceeding in any
such court or that any suit, action or other proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. In the event of any
litigation regarding or arising from this Agreement, the prevailing party
shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party its reasonable
expenses, attorneys' fees and costs incurred therein or in enforcement or
collection of any judgment or award rendered therein.

86 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person in
any action of any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York state
courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York, and
(ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules or
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction.

10.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING IN THE CASE OF ANY
ACTION AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE (OR ITS AFFILIATES) IN CONNECTION
WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER).

10.15 Release. Conditioned and effective upon the Closing, (a) each Company
Unitholder, in its capacity as a holder of Company Units, on such Company
Unitholder's own behalf and, as applicable and to the greatest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, on behalf of each of such Company Unitholder's
heirs, successors, assigns, and management companies and general partner
entities that are Affiliates of such Company Unitholder (collectively with
such Company Unitholder, the "Releasors"), hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waives, releases and forever discharges Purchaser, the Surviving
Company and their respective heirs, successors, assigns, Affiliates and
management companies and equityholders (collectively with Purchaser and the
Surviving Company, the "Company Parties") and each of their respective
successors, assigns and past, present and future directors, managers, officers
and employees, and each of their respective heirs, successors and assigns, in
each case in their capacity as such (collectively with the Company Parties,
the "Company Releasees") from any and all liabilities of any kind or nature
whatsoever, in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, known or unknown, arising on or prior to the Closing Date from
any claims relating to or arising out of such Company Unitholder's ownership
of the Company Units, the termination of such Company Unitholder's status as a
holder of Company Units and actions taken by the Company's officers,
directors, managers, members, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and
representatives in connection with the negotiation, authorization, approval
and recommendation of the terms of the Merger, and (b) each Company
Unitholder, for itself and the other Releasors, hereby irrevocably covenants
to refrain from, directly or indirectly,

87 

asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, distributing or causing to be
commenced, any action of any kind against any Company Releasees based on any
of the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing in this Section 10.15 will
waive, or preclude such Company Unitholder from exercising, any of such
Company Unitholder's rights, if any, (a) to receive and be paid its portion of
the Final Merger Consideration in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall
payable under, and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in,
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in respect of each Company Unit held
by such Company Unitholder immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Letter of Transmittal or any other
agreement entered into by such Company Unitholder (or with respect to which
such Company Unitholder is an express third-party beneficiary) in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c)
if such Company Unitholder is an employee of any member of the Company,
relating to such Company Unitholder's employment, including such Company
Unitholder's right to any compensation earned, such Company Unitholder's
benefits as an employee and any rights set forth under any employment
agreement, or (d) if such Company Unitholder's is a director, officer or
manager of any member of the Company Group, relating to such Company
Unitholder's right to exculpation, indemnification, advancement or
reimbursement of expenses and for any compensation or other fees earned.
