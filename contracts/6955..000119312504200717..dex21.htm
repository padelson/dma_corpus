RECITALS



WHEREAS, on the date of this Agreement, the Shareholders collectively own all
of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock of
the Company;



WHEREAS, immediately prior to the Closing Date, all of the outstanding
Preferred Stock of the Company shall be converted into Common Stock;



WHEREAS, prior to the Closing, all Stock Options and Exit Options shall have
been terminated; and



WHEREAS, on the Closing Date, the Purchaser desires to purchase all of the
issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (collectively, the " _Shares_ ")
from the Shareholders, and the Shareholders desire to sell the Shares to the
Purchaser, upon the terms and conditions herein set forth. 



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the respective
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:





ARTICLE I.



PURCHASE OF SHARES



1.1 _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Shareholders shall sell to the Purchaser
(or its designated Affiliate), and the Purchaser (or its designated Affiliate) shall purchase
from the Shareholders, all right, title and interest in and to all of the
Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances, which Shares will comprise all of
the issued and outstanding equity interests in the Company as of the Closing.
The aggregate purchase price payable by the Purchaser for all the Shares
pursuant to this Section 1.l shall be Three Hundred and Sixteen Million Seven
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($316,700,000) as adjusted pursuant to Sections 1.4
and 1.5 of this Agreement (the " _Purchase Price_ ").



1.2 _Payment of Option Debt_. Each Stock Option (other than an Exit Option),
whether or not vested or exercisable on the Closing Date, shall be cancelled
in exchange for a cash payment made by the Purchaser on the Closing Date to
the holder of such Stock Option in accordance with Section 1.4(f) of this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Option Holders_ ") in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the amount, if any, by which the Share Price exceeds the
Exercise Price of such Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares
subject to such Stock Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Exit Option
and any Stock Option that has an Exercise Price that equals or exceeds the
Share Price shall be cancelled as of the Closing Date without payment of any
consideration to the holder of such Exit Option or Stock Option. The
aggregate amount payable by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 1.2 with
respect to all Stock Options shall be hereinafter referred to as the " _Option
Debt_ ". For purposes of this Section 1.2, " _Share Price_ " shall be
calculated by dividing (i) the Closing Payment plus $20,000,000 by (ii) the
number of Shares.



1.3 _Change of Control Debt_. The Executive Employees are entitled to receive
payment upon the sale of the Shares on the Closing Date of an
aggregate amount calculated as set forth in the Sale Bonus Agreements entered
into by each of them with the Company (collectively, the " _Change of Control
Debt_ "). For purposes of this Section 1.3, the " _Executive Employees_ "
shall mean the following: Robert B. Kay, Keith McGowan, Ruzgar Barisik and
Albert W. Weggeman.



1.4 _Payments_. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Price in
the following manner:



(a) an amount equal to the Change of Control Debt will be deducted
pursuant to Section 1.4(h) and such amount less amounts required to be
withheld for tax purposes will be paid to the Executive Employees in
accordance with the amounts set forth on Schedule 1.3 to be delivered by the
Company not later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Change
of Control Debt Payments_ ");



(b) an amount (the " _Indebtedness Payments_ ") equal to the aggregate amount
required to satisfy (including any prepayment penalty or premium and accrued
interest) all Indebtedness of the Company (on a consolidated basis) as of the
Closing Date (other than the 10.5% Notes) shall reduce the amount of the
Closing Payment pursuant to subsection (h) below and the aggregate amounts of
the indebtedness described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition thereof
(the " _Debt Payments_ "), shall be paid to the holders of such Indebtedness.



 

\- 2 - (c) an amount equal to the principal and accrued interest on the 10.5% Notes
as of the Closing Date plus $1,600,000 (the " _Outstanding Note Balance_ ")
shall reduce the Purchase Price and the amount of the Closing Payment pursuant
to subsection (h) below;



(d) $20,000,000 (the " _Escrow Payment_ ") shall be deposited in an escrow
account pursuant to an Escrow Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit
A (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), to be executed and delivered at the Closing,
which escrow account shall be established for the purpose of satisfying the
Working Capital Adjustment and the Shareholders indemnification obligations
hereunder (the " _Escrow Account_ ");



(e) the amount of the Commissions will be paid as directed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule;



(f) an amount equal to the Option Debt, less amounts required to be
withheld for tax purposes, will be paid to the Option Holders;



(g) an amount equal to the fees and expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
unpaid as of the Closing as certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company in a certificate delivered not later than five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date (the " _Unpaid Transaction Fees_ ") shall reduce the Purchase
Price and shall be paid at the Closing; and



(h) an amount equal to the Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to
Section 1.5(a), but excluding adjustments in subsections (a) through (g)
above, less (i) the amount of the Change of Control Debt, (ii) the amount of
the Indebtedness Payments less the amount of cash of the Company (determined
in accordance with GAAP) as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the " _Closing Cash_ "), as estimated by the
Company in a certificate delivered to Purchaser not less than five (5) days
prior to the Closing, (iii) the amount of the Outstanding Note Balance, (iv)
the Escrow Payment, (v) the amount of the Option Debt, (vi) the amount of the
Unpaid Transaction Fees and (vii) the aggregate amount of the Commissions (the
" _Closing Payment_ ") shall be paid to the Shareholders in the relative
"Closing Payment Percentages" set forth next to the name of each Shareholder
on the written notice to be delivered pursuant to Section 4.10.



All payments under this Section 1.4 shall be made in U.S. Dollars and be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with
wiring instructions to be given to the Purchaser by written notice not less
than twenty-four hours prior to the time for payment specified herein.



1.5 _Working Capital Adjustment_.



(a) If, as of the Closing Date, there is a Working Capital Deficit based
on the Companys reasonable good faith estimate of the Working Capital to be
delivered not less than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, there shall
be a Purchase Price and Closing Payment adjustment in favor of the Purchaser
equal to the estimated Working Capital Deficit.



 

\- 3 - (b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to the Controlling Shareholders a balance sheet as of the Closing
Date prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently for all periods and
in accordance with the past accounting practices of the Company (the "
_Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement setting forth Purchasers
calculation of the Working Capital as of the Closing Date based on the Closing
Date Balance Sheet (the " _Working Capital Statement_ "). If the Controlling
Shareholders have any objections to the Closing Date Balance Sheet or Working
Capital Statement prepared by Purchaser, they will deliver a detailed
statement describing their objections to Purchaser within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Working Capital
Statement. If the Controlling Shareholders fail to deliver a notice of
objection within such thirty (30) day period, the Closing Date Balance Sheet
shall become final and binding on all parties. The Controlling
Shareholders and Purchaser will use reasonable best efforts to resolve any
such disputes, but if a final resolution is not obtained within thirty (30)
days after the Controlling Shareholders have submitted any objections, any
remaining matters which are in dispute will be resolved by the Chicago,
Illinois office of Deloitte and Touche LLP. Deloitte and Touche LLP will
prepare and deliver a written report to both parties and will submit a
proposed resolution of such unresolved disputes promptly, but in any event
within thirty (30) days after the dispute is submitted to such accounting
firm. Such accounting firms determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and Working Capital Statement will be final and binding upon all parties. If
such determination results in a Working Capital Deficit, then the entire
amount (after adjustment to reflect any purchase price adjustment previously
made under Section 1.5(a)) of the Working Capital Deficit shall be satisfied
out of the Escrow Account; it being understood between the Shareholders and
the Purchaser that Purchasers sole recourse for such Working Capital Deficit
is from the Escrow Account. The decision of Deloitte and Touche LLP shall be
final and not subject to appeal. The fees and expenses of Deloitte and Touche
LLP shall be equitably allocated by Deloitte and Touche LLP. Deloitte and
Touche LLP shall also verify the Closing Cash and any adjustment thereto shall
be either paid out of the Escrow Account or paid to the Shareholders (or set-
off against any Working Capital Deficit).

Subsidiaries has been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and has been issued without violation of any preemptive or
other right to purchase. Each outstanding share of or other equity interest in

of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such written notice shall set forth
in reasonable detail the nature and (to the extent then known) the amount of
the claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Partys right of
indemnification hereunder shall not be affected by its failure to give or by
its delay in giving such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, the
rights of the Indemnifying Party are materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure or delay.



(b) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume the defense of any
claim, suit, proceeding, action or assessment brought by any third
party (hereinafter " _Third Party Claim_ ") with counsel of his or its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party at any time within 15 days

of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to
preserve its rights in this regard; and _provided_ _further_ that the

into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior

damages by one or more of the Indemnifying Parties and does not impose an
injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party and (ii) the
Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld unreasonably).

however, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and consent to the

\- 32 - 6.8 _Limitations on Liability_.



(a) With respect to any claims for indemnification under Section 6.3(a) and
under Section 6.5 in respect of the Clyde Matter, the Binghamton Matter or

therefor until the aggregate of Shareholders indemnification obligations
thereunder, determined without regard to this Section 6.8 or
any indemnification obligation by Shareholders pursuant to Section 6.5 other
than with respect to the Clyde Matter, Binghamton Matter or the Lock Matter,
exceeds $1,000,000, and then only to the extent that such Losses exceed
$1,000,000 (the " _$1 Million Indemnity Deductible_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the $1 Million Indemnity Deductible shall not apply to claims by
Purchaser based on breaches of representations and warranties contained in
Sections 2.11 (Employee Benefit Matters), 2.12 (Taxes) and Section 2A.5
(Title).



(b) With respect to any claims for indemnification under Section 6.5 other
than in connection with the Clyde Matter, Binghamton Matter or the Lock
Matter, Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification until the aggregate
of Shareholders indemnification obligations thereunder (other than in
respect of the Clyde Matter, Binghamton Matter or the Lock Matter), determined
without regard to this Section 6.8, exceed $2,000,000, and then only to the
extent that such Environmental Liabilities exceed $2,000,000; _provided_
_that_ Purchaser shall be entitled to only 50% of the indemnification
otherwise available under Section 6.5 (other than in respect of the Clyde
Matter, Binghamton Matter or the Lock Matter) to the extent the Environmental
Liabilities exceed $2,000,000 up to $7,000,000; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
any such Environmental Liabilities exceeding $7,000,000 for which the
Purchaser is entitled to indemnification under Section 6.5 shall be the sole
obligation of the Shareholders.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this Agreement, the
aggregate liability of the Shareholders to the Purchaser pursuant to Article
VI and with respect to any Working Capital Deficit due to the Purchaser under
Section 1.5 (b) shall not exceed $20,000,000 (the " _Liability Cap_ ") and
the Purchasers sole recourse in respect of the Shareholders indemnification
obligations hereunder shall be the funds held pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Liability Cap shall not apply to
the claims for indemnification by reason of the Shareholders failure to
comply with its obligations under Section 4.9 (Exclusivity) or if this
Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) (the "
_Cap Exceptions_ ").



6.9 _Determination of Losses_. The Purchaser and the Shareholders shall make
appropriate adjustments for tax benefits and insurance coverage in determining
Losses for purposes of this Article VI. All indemnification payments under
this Article VI shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price.

foregoing indemnification provisions in this Article VI shall be
the exclusive remedy of the Purchaser following the Closing with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.10, the Purchaser understands and agrees that its right
to indemnification under Section 6.5 for breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 2.16 and for Environmental  



 

\- 33 -  Liabilities shall constitute its sole and exclusive remedy against the
Shareholders with respect to any environmental, health, or safety matter
relating to the past, current or future facilities, properties or operations
of the Company, its Subsidiaries, and all of their respective predecessors or
Affiliates, including without limitation any such matter arising under any
Environmental Laws. Aside from such right to indemnification, the Purchaser
hereby waives any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek
contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other recourse or remedy from the
Shareholders, and hereby releases the Shareholders from any claim, demand or
liability, with respect to any such environmental, health, or safety matter
(including without limitation any arising under any Environmental Laws and
including without limitation any arising under CERCLA, any analogous
state law, or the common law).
