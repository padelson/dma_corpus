Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds.



Section 1.07 Third-Party Consents. Subject to the terms of Article V, Buyer
and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain
all Consents of Governmental Bodies and other third parties required with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, all
Consents of Governmental Bodies and other third parties listed in Section 3.03
of the Disclosure Schedules, and Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy all conditions relating to such Consents of

letters of comfort, commitments, understandings, agreements and other
obligations related in any way to such Consents.

Agreement concerning Tax matters. Section 3.12 Employee Benefits.

(a) Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedules identifies each Employee
Benefit Plan. Section 3.12(a) further identifies each Employee Benefit Plan of
the Companies that will remain in effect after Closing until December 31, 2020
(and then cease at such date), and each Employee Benefit Plan that will cease
at Closing (subject to continued availability as provided in the Transition
Services Agreement). Each Employee Benefit Plan has been funded, maintained
and administered and complies, and since May 7, 2019 has complied, in form and
operation with its terms and all applicable Laws including, but not limited
to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, or any regulations or rules promulgated
thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the
Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act and any other applicable law have been timely made, in each
case, in all material respects. Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to
be tax-qualified has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or is entitled to rely upon the opinion
letter issued to any prototype or volume submitter plan which has been
adopted, and to Seller's Knowledge no event has occurred that could result in
the loss of tax-qualified status of such Employee Benefit Plan. Except as set

not made any commitment or taken any action to adopt or establish any
additional employee benefit plans or to materially increase the benefits under
any of the Employee Benefit Plans, and (ii) no action has been taken to

fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the
administration of or investment of the assets of any Employee Benefit Plan.

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedules, the
Companies do not, nor does any ERISA Affiliate of the Companies or any
predecessor thereof, sponsor, maintain, contribute to or have any Liability
with respect to, and has not in the past sponsored, maintained, contributed to
or had any Liability with respect to, any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA,
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, any multiemployer plan as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, any multiple employer plan as defined in
Section 413 of the Code, any multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined
in Section 3(40) of ERISA or any funded welfare plan as defined in Section 419
of the Code, any voluntary employees beneficiary association within the
meaning of Code Section 501(c)(9), or any plan that provides coverage either
(A) primarily for the benefit of employees who reside outside of the United
States or (B) for any persons who are not resident in the United States and
are not United States Citizens.

(c) Neither the Companies nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in any
transaction that would cause the Buyer to be subject to any Liability under
Section 4069 of ERISA. Except as set forth on Section 3.12(c) of the
Disclosure Schedules, neither the Companies nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred any Liability under Title IV of ERISA which could become a Liability
of the Buyer following the Closing and no event has occurred with respect to
any Employee Benefit Plan that could result in any such Liability to the
Buyer. The Companies have not engaged in any nonexempt "prohibited transaction" under Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code in connection with which the Buyer could be subject to any
Liability. There are no material pending or, to the Seller's Knowledge,
threatened claims or Action involving any Employee Benefit Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits) or any other litigation involving any Employee
Benefit Plan that could reasonably be expected to result in any such Liability
to the Buyer. To the Knowledge of Seller, except as set forth on Section
3.12(c) of the Disclosure Schedules, there is no pending investigation or
enforcement action by the PBGC, the Department of Labor or IRS or any other
governmental agency with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan. None of Seller
or the Companies or any ERISA Affiliate (a) has provided, or would reasonably
be expected to be required to provide, security to any Employee Benefit Plan
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, and (b) has taken any action, or
omitted to take any action, that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected
to result, in the imposition of a lien under Section 430(k) of the Code or
pursuant to ERISA. Each Employee Benefit Plan which is exempt from certain
disclosure requirements of ERISA as a "top hat" plan, has timely filed the
exemption letter required by the Department of Labor. No Employee Benefit Plan
that is subject to the minimum funding standards of ERISA or the Code has
failed to meet the minimum funding standard within the meaning of Sections
412, 430 or 436 of the Code or Sections 206(g), 302 or 303 of ERISA, whether
or not waived. All contributions required to have been made by the Companies
to any Employee Benefit Plan pursuant to Law (including ERISA and the Code) or
the terms of such Employee Benefit Plan or pursuant to any employee benefit
arrangements under any collective bargaining agreement to which any of the
Companies is a party on or before the date of this Agreement have been made
within the time prescribed by such Applicable Law or the terms of such
Employee Benefit Plan, and all benefits accrued under any unfunded Employee
Benefit Plan have been paid, accrued or otherwise adequately reserved in
accordance with GAAP, and each of Seller and the Companies have performed all
material obligations required to be performed under all Employee Benefit Plans
with respect to which any of the Companies or any ERISA Affiliate of any of
the Companies has an obligation to contribute. Insofar as the representation
made in the previous sentence applies to Sections 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title
IV of ERISA, it is made with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, program,
agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which the Companies,

prior to the Closing Date. All insurance premiums with respect to the Employee
Benefit Plans for all periods prior to the Closing Date have been timely paid
in full.

(d) Except as set forth on Section 3.12(d) of the Disclosure Schedules, no
Employee Benefit Plan provides benefits, and, to the Knowledge of Seller,
there has been no communication by Seller or the Companies employees that
would reasonably be expected to constitute a promise or guarantee by Seller or
the Companies to such employees regarding the availability of benefits,

insured), with respect to employees of the Companies beyond their retirement
or other termination of service, other than as required by COBRA or similar

benefit increases under any Employee Benefit Plan that may be or become
enforceable against the Buyer following the Closing Date.

of any right or interest for the benefit of, any present or former personnel
of the Companies which become payable as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether alone or in connection
with any other event. The execution, delivery of, and performance by Seller
and the Companies, or any of them, (or by Buyer or by reason of Buyer's
assumption of obligations of Seller or the Companies or any of them that exist
immediately prior to the Closing) of its obligations under the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent event) will not (i) except as disclosed on Section
3.12(g) of the Disclosure Schedule, result in any payment (whether of

vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits
with respect to any current, former or retired employees, officers,
consultants, independent contractors, agents or directors of Seller, the
Companies or any affiliate; (ii) result in the triggering or imposition of any
restrictions or limitations on the right of the Companies to amend or
terminate any Employee Benefit Plan; or (iii) except as disclosed on Section

within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code that would result in a
deduction disallowance under Code Section 280G(a) on the part of the Buyer,
the Companies or any of them. None of the Companies maintains any compensation
plans, programs, agreements or arrangements the payments under which would not
reasonably be expected to be deductible for federal income tax purposes for
calendar year 2020 as a result of the limitations under Section 162(m) of the
Code and the regulations issued thereunder. None of the Companies has any
obligation to pay any gross-up or reimbursement for taxes under Section 4999
of the Code with respect to this or any prior transaction. With respect to
each Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(as defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code), (i) such plan has been
operated and administered in compliance with Section 409A of the Code or (ii)
any payments under such plan have been earned and vested on or prior to
December 31, 2004, and such plans have not been materially modified other than
modifications to comply with Code Section 409A and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. None of the Companies has entered into or assumed any agreement or arrangement to, and do not otherwise have any obligation to,
indemnify or hold harmless any Person (or to provide any gross-up or
reimbursement of any penalty, interest or taxes to any Person) for any
material Liability that results from the failure to comply with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. None of the Companies has made any agreement, taken any action, or
omitted to take any action that would reasonably be expected to subject any of
the Companies to any obligation to report any amount or withhold any amount as

Representatives to hold, in confidence, all confidential documents and
information concerning the Companies furnished to Buyer or its Representatives
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the
manner specified in the Confidentiality Agreement between Seller and
[REDACTED] dated July 10, 2020 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").



Section 5.02 Conduct of the Business. Except for matters set forth in Section
5.02 of the Disclosure Schedules or matters otherwise permitted or required by
the terms of this Agreement or except for the Reorganization or except as
required by Applicable Law, from the date of this Agreement to the Closing
Date, Seller and the Companies shall conduct each Company's business in the
Ordinary Course. In addition (and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing), except as set forth in Section 5.02 of the Disclosure Schedules or
otherwise permitted or required by the terms of this Agreement or except as
required by Applicable Law, Seller shall not permit the Companies to do any of
the following without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed):

instruments;

(b) issue any equity interest in the Companies or any option, warrant or right
relating thereto or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any

action could have a material adverse impact on Buyer or the Companies after
the Closing; (g) acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the equity interests or assets of, or by any other manner, any
business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business

Section 5.03 Access to Books and Records. From the date of this Agreement
until the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer and its Representatives
with reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice
to the offices, properties, books and records of the Companies and, to the
extent pertaining to the transition of the ownership of the Companies and
their business to Buyer; provided that such access does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations of the Companies, Seller or any of its
Affiliates; provided further that all requests for such access shall be
directed to Seller or such other Person as Seller may designate in writing
from time to time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
except in connection with its disclosure obligations under Article III hereof,
Seller shall not be required to disclose any information to Buyer if such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to (a) jeopardize any attorney-client or
other legal privilege or (b) contravene any Applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date hereof. Seller makes no
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information (if any)
provided pursuant to this Section 5.03, and Buyer may not rely on the accuracy
of any such information, in each case other than as expressly set forth in the
representations and warranties contained in Article III. The information
provided pursuant to this Section 5.03 will be used solely for the purpose of
evaluating and effecting the transactions contemplated hereby and will be
governed by all the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause all of its Representatives, to abide by all
Governmental Bodies' and Seller's safety rules, regulations and operating
policies while conducting any due diligence evaluation at a site that is owned
or operated by Seller or its Affiliates. Except in connection with its
disclosure obligations under Article III hereof, nothing set forth in this
Agreement shall require Seller to (i) provide Buyer with access to or copies
of sensitive customer or supplier information which, in Seller's business
judgment, should not be provided to Buyer until the transactions contemplated
hereby have been consummated, (ii) provide any information in any other format
or otherwise to manipulate or reconfigure any data, (iii) allow Buyer to
conduct any invasive investigations of soil, groundwater or other media, or
(iv) provide Buyer with any information regarding Seller's or any of its
Affiliates' businesses, assets, financial performance or condition or
operations not involving the Companies or the Company Assets. In accordance with Section 8.03, Buyer agrees to indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless (including reasonable attorneys' fees) Seller
Indemnified Parties with respect to such activities conducted under this
Section 5.03.



Section 5.04 Efforts.

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each Party
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur on
or prior to the Termination Date, including taking all actions necessary to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it or any
of its Affiliates with respect to the Closing. Each Party shall not and shall
not permit any of its respective Affiliates to, take any actions that would,
or that could reasonably be expected to, result in any of the conditions set
forth in Article II not being satisfied. Without limiting the foregoing or the
provisions set forth in Section 5.02, each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur on or prior to the
Termination Date.

(b) Prior to the Closing, each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and to cooperate in
obtaining, all Consents from third parties necessary or appropriate to permit
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that neither Buyer, the Companies, Seller nor any other Subsidiary of
Seller shall be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any
obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any such Consent may be required
(other than nominal filing or application fees). The Parties acknowledge that
Seller will seek, as part of any Consent, the release of Seller from any and
all guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letters of comfort,
commitments, understandings, agreements and other obligations related in any
way to Contracts subject to such Consents. Nothing in this Section 5.04(b)
shall require Buyer or Seller to post any security or collateral or make any
payment in order to obtain any Consent. For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall be
solely responsible for obtaining the Consents set forth on Section 3.03 of the
Disclosure Schedules and for obtaining the release of Seller from any and all
guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letters of comfort, commitments,
understandings, agreements and other obligations related in any way to such
Consents, except as set forth in Sections 5.07(d) and 5.07(e). The Parties
acknowledge that certain Consents and waivers with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to the Contracts
and Company Leases listed in the Disclosure Schedules and that such Consents
and waivers may not be obtained prior to Closing. If a Consent is not
obtained, or if an attempted assignment of a Property or Contract would be
ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of Seller, any Company, or
any other Subsidiary of Seller such that the Companies or Buyer would not in
fact receive all such rights of the Property or Contract, the Parties will
cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement, to the extent reasonably
practicable, under which the Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume the
obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, including
independent sub-contracting, sub-licensing or sub-leasing to such Buyer which
Seller would enforce for the benefit of Buyer, with Buyer assuming Seller's
(or Seller's Affiliates') obligations, against a third party thereto. Other
than as expressly set forth in this Section 5.04(b) and Section 7.03, Seller
shall not have any Liability whatsoever to Buyer arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any Consents or waivers that may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because
of the termination of any Contract as a result thereof. Buyer acknowledges
that no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained herein shall
be breached or deemed to be inaccurate or breached as a result of the failure
to obtain any such Consent or waiver. This Section 5.04(b) does not relate to
Coal Sales Agreements, such items being the subject of Section 5.04(c).

(c) Prior to Closing, Seller shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all Consents required from third parties under the Coal Sales
Agreements set forth in Section 5.04(c) to the Disclosure Schedules that are
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(ii) subject to the following sentence, assign or otherwise transfer, or cause
to be assigned or otherwise transferred, to one or more of the Companies, all
of Seller's or its Affiliate's right, title, and interest in and to such Coal
Sales Agreements; provided, however, that neither Buyer nor Seller shall be
required to amend any Coal Sales Agreement or to pay or commit to pay any
amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any such
Consent may be required. The Parties acknowledge that as a result of the
impending sale of the Companies to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, Seller
shall not transfer any Coal Sales Agreement from an Affiliate of Seller to a
Company without first obtaining the written consent of the counterparty
thereto. Nothing in this Section 5.04(c) shall require Buyer to post any
security or collateral or make any payment in order to obtain an assignment of
any Coal Sales Agreements. [REDACTED] Buyer acknowledges that no
representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained herein shall be
breached or deemed inaccurate or breached as a result of the failure to obtain
any such Consent or waiver to a Coal Sales Agreement.



Section 5.05 Resignation of Managers. Unless otherwise requested in writing by
Buyer, Seller shall obtain the resignations, effective contemporaneously with
the Closing, of the managers of each Company.



Section 5.06 Tax Matters.

(a) Transaction Tax Treatment. The Parties agree that the sale of the Units by
Seller to Buyer hereunder shall be treated for United States federal income
Tax purposes (and any applicable state and local income Tax purposes to the
extent permissible under Applicable Laws) as the sale by Seller of the
equity/Units of the Companies to the Buyer in exchange for the Assumed
Liabilities of the Companies.

(b) Transfer Taxes. All sales (including bulk sales), use, value added,
documentary, stamp, gross receipts, registration, transfer, conveyance,
excise, recording, license, stock transfer stamps and other similar Taxes and
fees ("Transfer Taxes") arising out of or in connection with or attributable
to the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement, including any
Transfer Tax filings required for PA Land and the transactions required under
Section 5.08, shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent
(50%) by Buyer. Buyer shall timely prepare and file all Tax Returns required
to be filed with respect to Transfer Taxes and shall deliver a copy of any
such Tax Return, as filed, to Seller. (c) Apportionment of Property Taxes. Real property Taxes, personal property
Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes (collectively, "Property Taxes") levied
with respect to the Company Assets that relate to the Straddle Period shall be
apportioned between Pre-Closing Periods and Post-Closing Periods on a per diem
basis, and the Seller shall be responsible for and shall pay the portion of
such Property Taxes apportioned to the Pre-Closing Periods (and shall within
ten (10) Business Days reimburse the Buyer or the Companies, as applicable,
for such Property Taxes to the extent the Buyer or the Companies pay such
Property Taxes after the Closing), and the Buyer and the Companies, jointly
and severally, shall be responsible for and shall pay the portion of such
Property Taxes apportioned to the Post-Closing Periods and any portion of such
Property Taxes apportioned to the Pre-Closing Periods (and shall reimburse the
Seller for any such Property Taxes as provided herein to the extent that the
Seller or the Companies pay such Property Taxes at or before the Closing,
which amount will be set forth on Section 5.06(c) of the Disclosure Schedules
and updated on the Closing Date the "Buyer Property Tax Amount"). Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for such Buyer Property Tax Amount owed to Seller by paying
such amount in equal installments over a ten (10) month period beginning on
the 15th day of the month following the first full month after the Closing
Date, but the total amount of such Buyer Property Tax Amount shall be paid in
full no later than September 30, 2021. Buyer shall offset such Buyer Property
Tax Amount owed to Seller by any Liabilities that Buyer, with the mutual
agreement of Seller, agrees to assume that are in addition to the Assumed
Liabilities.

(d) Apportionment of Taxes other than Property Taxes. For purposes of
apportioning Taxes other than Property Taxes, the following provisions shall
govern:

(i) in the case of Taxes in the form of interest or penalties, all such Taxes
shall be treated as attributable to a Pre-Closing Period (or the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) to the extent relating to a
Tax for a Pre-Closing Period (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date) whether such items are incurred, accrued, assessed or similarly
charged on, before or after the Closing Date; and

(ii) in the case of all other Taxes for a Straddle Period (including, without
limitation, income Taxes, employment Taxes, and sales and use Taxes), the
amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined as if the Companies each filed a separate Tax
Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period
ending as of the end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the
books methodology." For purposes of this Section 5.06(d)(ii), any item
determined on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and
depreciation deductions and the effects of graduated rates), to the extent
that such item does not include current liabilities of the Companies, shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
determined by multiplying such item by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period. (e) Tax Cooperation. Subject to a right to reimbursement for all Property
Taxes that are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 5.06, and for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall pay or shall cause a
Company to pay all Taxes due and owing on or after the Closing Date. The
Parties shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any Action,
audit or other proceeding regarding Taxes with respect to the Companies. Such
cooperation shall include the retention (until the expiration of the
applicable limitation period, taking into account any extension thereof) of
and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and information
reasonably relevant to any such Action, audit or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

The Seller, at the sole cost and expense of the Seller, shall (i) prepare and
timely file all Tax Returns of the Companies due (after taking into account
all appropriate extensions) on or prior to the Closing Date ("Company Prepared
Returns") and (ii) timely pay all Taxes that are shown as payable with respect
to Company Prepared Returns. All Company Prepared Returns shall be prepared in
accordance with existing procedures, practices and accounting methods of the
Companies.

The Buyer shall cause each Company (at its expense) to prepare and timely file
all Tax Returns of such Company due after the Closing Date (the "Buyer
Prepared Returns").

(f) Amendments. Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall amend any Tax
Return of or with respect to the Companies (i) with respect to any Pre-Closing
Period or (ii) that materially and adversely affects or may materially and
adversely affect the Tax Liability of Seller or its Affiliates, in each case
without the prior consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

(g) Tax Contests.

(i) If any Taxing Authority issues to any Company (i) a written notice of its
intent to audit or conduct another Action with respect to Taxes of such
Company for any Pre-Closing Period or (ii) a written notice of deficiency for
Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period, the Buyer or the respective Company shall
notify the Seller of its receipt of such communication from the Taxing
Authority within fifteen (15) days of receipt. No failure or delay of the
Buyer or the respective Company in the performance of the foregoing shall
reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or Liabilities of the Seller
pursuant to this Agreement except to the extent the Seller is actually
prejudiced by such failure or delay, provided, however, that Buyer and the
Companies, jointly and severally, shall be responsible for and shall pay any
such Taxes in the form of interest and penalties that accrue as a result of
any failure or delay of the Buyer or the Companies in the performance of the
foregoing.

(ii) The Companies shall control any audit or other Action in respect of any
Taxes of the Companies (a "Tax Contest"); provided, however, if the Tax
Contest relates solely to a Pre-Closing Period, the Seller shall have the right to assume
control of such Tax Contest if within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of
the Tax Contest the Seller notifies the Buyer of its intent to take control of
such Tax Contest.

(iii) If the Seller does not control a Tax Contest for a Pre-Closing Period,
(i) the Seller shall have the right, at the sole cost and expense of the
Seller, to participate in such Tax Contest; and (ii) the Buyer shall not allow
the Companies to settle, resolve or abandon such Tax Contest if it would
result in the Seller paying any Indemnified Taxes hereunder without the prior
written permission of the Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

(iv) If the Seller controls a Tax Contest for a Pre-Closing Period, (i) the
Seller shall control the audit or Action in good faith; (ii) the Seller shall
bear all costs and expenses of the Seller and the Companies in connection with
such Tax Contest; and (iii) the Seller shall keep the Buyer reasonably
informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
have the sole right to control the conduct of any Tax audit, examination,
inquiry or assessment relating to income Taxes of the Seller or its
Affiliates.

(h) Income Tax Returns. SUBJECT TO THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT, BUYER AND
ITS ACCOUNTANTS SHALL HAVE ACCESS TO THE INCOME TAX RETURNS OR RELATED
WORKPAPERS OF SELLER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES AS REASONABLY REQUESTED BY BUYER
TO ASSIST IT IN THE PREPARATION OF ITS TAX RETURNS.

(i) Tax Refunds. Buyer or any Affiliate thereof shall promptly inform the
Seller of any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit received with respect to
Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Period and promptly pay to the Seller
the amount of such Tax refund, credit or similar benefit (the "Tax Refund").
Buyer shall pay to the Seller such Tax Refund within ten (10) days of receipt
of such Tax Refund (or, if the Tax Refund is a Tax credit or similar benefit,
the filing of any Tax Return utilizing such Tax Refund (in the form of a
credit or offset to Taxes otherwise payable)) and provide a reasonably
detailed description of the Tax Refund. The Parties hereto agree that Tax
Refunds for the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall
be determined using the methodologies set forth in Section 5.06(c) in the case
of Property Taxes and otherwise based on an interim closing of the books or
records of the Companies at the close of business on the day prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly take
all reasonable actions (including those actions reasonably requested by the
Seller) to file for and obtain any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit that
would give rise to a Tax Refund. Buyer shall, upon request, permit the Seller
to participate in the prosecution of any such Tax Refund claim and shall not
settle or otherwise resolve any such Tax Refund claim without the prior
written consent of the Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

(j) Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all existing Tax
sharing agreements (whether written or not) binding upon the Companies shall
be terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date none of the Companies shall have any further
rights or liabilities thereunder.

(k) Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of Section 5.06 shall survive for the full period of all applicable
statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension
thereof) plus sixty (60) days.



Section 5.07 Governmental Filings; Guarantees/Commitments.

(a) Governmental Filings. As soon as practicable and in no event more than ten
(10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall complete and
file all necessary documents and information as required by and in accordance
with Applicable Law and the appropriate Governmental Body with respect to the
change in ownership and control of the Companies contemplated hereby. The
Parties agree to fully cooperate with each other in all such filings,
including providing any additional information and the preparation and
execution of any additional documents that may be reasonably requested by all
applicable Governmental Bodies with respect to the change in ownership and
control of the Companies and any name change related to the same. Buyer shall
bear all fees and other direct costs (including consultant and engineering
fees) related to filings required in furtherance of this Transaction under all
Company Permits.

(b) Indemnified Guarantees. From and after the Closing, except for the
Excluded Liabilities and subject to the Seller indemnification obligations in
Article VIII, Buyer and the Companies, jointly and severally, shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates (and their respective
directors and officers) from and against all Damages which any such Person
shall incur, sustain or suffer and which relate to, or arise directly or
indirectly, out of or in connection with: (i) Seller or any of its Affiliates
issuing, making payment under, being required to pay or reimburse the issuer
of, or being a party to, any guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter of
credit, letter of comfort or other obligation relating to the business of the
Companies, including those listed in Section 5.07(b) of the Disclosure
Schedules (collectively, the "Indemnified Guarantees"); (ii) any claim or
demand for payment made on Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to any
given Indemnified Guarantees; or (iii) any Action, decision or proceeding by
any Person who is or claims to be entitled to the benefit of or claims to be
entitled to payment, reimbursement or indemnity with respect to any
Indemnified Guarantees.

(c) Company Permits. In the event that, as of the Closing, not all approvals
of all applicable Governmental Bodies have been obtained, if required by any
or all Governmental Bodies, with respect to the Company Permits (including, as
applicable, with respect to the transfer and/or reissuance of any such Company
Permits to Buyer and/or the Companies), to the extent that Buyer and/or the
Companies operate under any such Company Permits after the Closing pending the
receipt of such approvals, Buyer shall notify Seller immediately regarding any
notice of violation of, or failure to comply with, any such Company Permit,
and Seller shall be entitled to undertake, at Buyer's sole cost and expense,
any actions and measures that Seller believes are necessary and appropriate to
cure, remedy or abate such violations or failure to comply as soon as
practicable. In such event, Buyer and the Companies, as applicable, shall cease any conduct and activities giving rise to such violations or failure to
comply, and shall provide Seller with any and all access to the relevant
properties and facilities and information as may be requested or necessary in
connection with Seller's efforts to cure, remedy or abate such violations and
failure to comply. Buyer and the Companies shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller against any and all Liabilities and Damages arising from or
relating to the matters described in this Section 5.07(c).

(d) Substituted Guarantees. On or before Closing, Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause itself and the Companies to be
substituted in all respects for Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Companies) with respect to the period from and after the Closing, and for
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies) to be released in respect
of all obligations of Seller and any of its Affiliates (other than the
Companies) under each of the guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit,
letters of comfort, commitments, understandings, agreements and other
obligations of such Persons related to the Companies' business listed in
Section 5.07(d) of the Disclosure Schedules (collectively, the "Substituted
Guarantees"); provided, however, that in the event that such substitution and
release is not obtained for any Substituted Guarantees, then following the
Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates against, and reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for, any and all
amounts paid, including costs or expenses in connection with any such
Substituted Guarantee, including Seller's and its Affiliates' expenses in
maintaining any such Substituted Guarantee, whether or not any such
Substituted Guarantee is drawn upon or required to be performed, and shall in
any event promptly reimburse Seller to the extent any such Substituted
Guarantee is called upon and Seller or its Affiliates make any payment or are
obligated to reimburse the party issuing the Substituted Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after Closing, Buyer shall continue to
use all commercially reasonable efforts, at its sole expense, to cause itself
and the Companies to be substituted in all respects for Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Companies), and for Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Companies) to be released in respect of all obligations under
the Substituted Guarantees. After Closing, unless otherwise directed in
writing by Seller, Buyer shall not renew, extend, amend, or supplement any
loan, contract (including but not limited to any Coal Sales Agreement or
Contract) lease, or other obligation that is covered by a Substituted
Guarantee unless Seller's obligation thereunder has been fully released and
discharged for such renewal, extension, amended, or supplemental period.
Nothing in this Section 5.07(d) shall require Buyer to post any security or
collateral or make any payment in order to replace the Substituted Guarantees.

(e) [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. Within 180 calendar days of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, at its sole expense, cause Seller and its Affiliates to be
released in respect of all obligations of Seller and any of its Affiliates;
and, if required, cause Buyer and the Companies to be substituted in all
respects for Seller and any of its Affiliates under (i) that certain letter of
credit [REDACTED] in the amount of [REDACTED] and the associated adequate
assurance letter agreement [REDACTED] (together, the "[REDACTED]"); and (ii)
that certain Supply Bond [REDACTED] in the amount of [REDACTED] (the
"[REDACTED]" and together with the [REDACTED], the "[REDACTED]"). In the event
Buyer is unable to obtain a full release of all obligations of Seller and any
of its Affiliates under either or both of the [REDACTED] on or before Closing,
then following the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against, and reimburse Seller and its Affiliates
for, any and all amounts paid, including costs or expenses in connection with
any such [REDACTED], including Seller's and its Affiliates' expenses in
maintaining any such [REDACTED], whether or not any such [REDACTED] is drawn
upon or required to be performed, and shall in any event promptly reimburse
Seller to the extent any such [REDACTED] is called upon and Seller or its
Affiliates make any payment or are obligated to reimburse the party issuing
the [REDACTED]. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Buyer is unable to
obtain the full release of all obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates
under either or both of the [REDACTED] within 180 calendar days of the Closing
Date, Buyer shall post with Seller security (in a form reasonably satisfactory
to Seller) for the total amount Seller still has posted in [REDACTED] until
such time as Buyer obtains the full release of Seller required under this
Section 5.07(e).

(f) Replacement Bonds. Without limiting the generality of Section 5.07(d), and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, on the Closing Date and
subject to Seller's contemporaneous payment to Buyer's bonding company of the
Surety Bond Cash Collateral, Buyer shall, at Buyer's sole cost and expense,
secure and deliver, or cause to be secured and delivered, to the applicable
Governmental Bodies, replacement bonds and or replacement securities and
guarantees and/or other similar financial security sufficient to cause the
applicable Governmental Body to release Seller and any of its Affiliates under
each Company Bond and with respect to the Company Permits identified in
Section 3.19(a) of the Disclosure Schedules ("Replacement Bonds").

(g) Radioactive Materials License. Until such time as the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Radiation
Protection ("DEP") has given its consent in writing to the indirect transfer
of Radioactive Materials License No. PA-1579 (the "DEP License") pursuant to
25 Pa. Code § 215.1, as amended, incorporating by reference 10 C.F.R. §
30.34(b), Buyer agrees that it will refrain from exercising any of its rights
as a member of Cumberland in respect to Cumberland's DEP License, including
but not limited to, the following:

(i) Buyer shall not exercise any control over the activities and materials
governed by the DEP License;

(ii) Buyer shall not exercise any budgetary decision-making with respect to
the activities or materials governed by the DEP License, and specifically
shall not reduce funding for any activities undertaken by Cumberland to comply
with the DEP License;

(iii) Buyer shall not replace or remove Cumberland's current Radiation Safety
Officer; and

(iv) Buyer shall not undertake any other action that would interfere, directly
or indirectly, in whole or in part, with any health, safety, security, and
environmental protection matter related to or arising out of the DEP License,
or the activities and materials utilized thereunder. Until such time as the DEP has given its consent in writing to the indirect
transfer of the DEP License, it is the intent of the parties that this Section
5.07(g) be liberally construed to ensure that Cumberland shall retain full
power and authority over the DEP License.



Section 5.08 Interim Transactions. Prior to Closing, (i) Seller shall convey
or otherwise transfer, or cause to be conveyed or otherwise transferred to one
or more of the Companies, all of the Seller's or its Affiliates' right, title
and interest in and to the Company Owned Properties not currently owned by the
Companies, pursuant to Deeds substantially in the forms attached hereto as
Exhibit F (collectively, the "Company Owned Property Deeds"), (ii) Seller
shall assign, convey or otherwise transfer, or cause to be assigned, conveyed
or otherwise transferred to one or more of the Companies, all of Seller's or
its Affiliates' right, title and interest in and to the Company Leased

Companies shall assume, pay, satisfy, perform and discharge when due any and
all Assumed Liabilities (with respect to the Company Owned Properties and
Company Leased Properties) pursuant to the Lease Assignment and Assumption
Agreements, in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit G (collectively, the
"Company Lease Assignment and Assumption Agreements"), (iii) Seller may, at
its sole discretion at any time or times before, on or after the Closing Date,
(y) enter into a transaction to divest a Company or the Companies of any
rights in and to the Excluded Assets, and (z) terminate the rights of a
Company or the Companies under any Sourcing Contract that is not held
exclusively by a Company or the Companies, but is held jointly by any of the
Companies together with Seller or an Affiliate of Seller; provided, however,
that Seller shall provide Buyer with 5 days advance written notice of the
termination of any Sourcing Contract; and (iv) Seller shall assign or
otherwise transfer, or cause to be assigned or otherwise transferred to one or
more of the Companies, all of Seller's or its Affiliates' right, title and
interest in and to the Contracts set forth in Section 5.08 to the Disclosure
Schedules, which are not currently owned or held by the Companies, and the
Companies shall assume, pay, satisfy, perform and discharge when due any and
all Assumed Liabilities pursuant to the form of assignment attached hereto as
Exhibit H; provided, however, to the extent the foregoing would require the
assignment by Seller or any of its Affiliates of their rights and obligations
under any Contract, and such rights and obligations may not be so assigned
without the consent of another Person, and such consent is not obtained prior
to Closing, then (1) the Parties shall reasonably cooperate and enter into any
reasonable and lawful arrangements, at no additional cost to Buyer, designed
to provide Buyer or its designees the benefits under the applicable Contract
and to cause Buyer or its designees to perform the obligations under the
applicable Contract, and (2) in the event the Parties agree to enter into an
alternate arrangement pursuant to Section 5.08(iv)(1), the failure of Seller
or its Affiliates to assign such Contract shall not be taken into account for
purposes of the condition to Buyer's obligations set forth in Section 2.02.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.08 does not relate to Coal Sales
Agreements, such items being the subject of Section 5.04(c).



Section 5.09 Name Change. As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date,

make (or cause to be made) all filings (including assumed name filings)
required to reflect the change of names of the Companies required under
Section 5.09(i) in all applicable records of Governmental Bodies and any open Permit Proceedings and any pending Permit
Applications. Buyer shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks, trade
names or other similar rights belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.
Buyer shall provide copies of such filings to Seller and be solely responsible
for any direct or indirect costs or expenses resulting from the change in use
of name, and any resulting notification or approval requirements.



Section 5.10 Seller Retention Obligations. Within ten (10) Business Days
following Closing, Seller shall cause all outstanding amounts and payments due

or its post-Closing Affiliates or any of the Transferred Employees or (b)
induce or otherwise counsel, advise or encourage any employee, officer or
director of the Companies or its post-Closing Affiliates or any of the
Transferred Employees to leave the employment of the Companies and their post-
Closing Affiliates; provided, that this Section 5.12 shall not preclude the

filed by Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., et al. in or around 2016; (ii) the
legacy predecessors in interest to the Companies set forth in Section 5.13 of
the Disclosure Schedules remain in existence as of the date of this Agreement
and continue to hold certain legacy bonds related to roads (the "Legacy

Legacy Bonds before and/or after the Closing, and Buyer covenants and agrees
to cooperate in good faith with Seller in connection with any steps required
to be taken to secure the release of the Legacy Bonds. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer agrees to furnish such further information,
execute and deliver such other documents, and do such other acts and things,
all as Seller may reasonably request for the purpose of securing the release
of the Legacy Bonds.



Section 5.14 FBL and Workers' Compensation Claims. (a) Seller shall be responsible for and obligated to pay all Black Lung
Liabilities of the Companies related to Actions filed by any Transferred

(c) Buyer acknowledges that, upon the Closing Date, and except for as provided
in Section 5.14(a) and Section 5.14(b) above, the Companies shall be obligated

the Companies arising from or related to Actions filed by any Transferred
Employees or any dependents or other beneficiaries of any such individuals.



Section 5.15 Affiliate Contracts. Except for the Reorganization, including

any and all charges, dues, Taxes, fines, claims, Liabilities, losses, damages,
payments, deficiencies, awards, settlements, assessments, judgments, fees,

respect to any Damages otherwise payable under Section 8.01(i) unless the
aggregate amount of Damages with respect to all such Damages exceeds $[REDACTED] (the "Deductible") and then

representatives), from and against all Damages asserted against, resulting to,
imposed upon or incurred by Seller or its Affiliates (or their respective

jurisdiction).



Section 8.05 Procedures for Indemnification. If an indemnified party shall
desire to assert any claim for indemnification provided for under this Article
VIII other than a claim in respect of, arising out of or involving a Third-
Party Claim, such indemnified party (the "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt written notice to the party against whom indemnity is sought
(the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement
of any Action in respect of which indemnity may be sought and will provide
such Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request; provided, that the failure to give
such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided for hereunder
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially
prejudiced by such failure.



Section 8.06 Conditions of Indemnification with Respect to Third-Party Claims.
The obligations and Liabilities of the Parties with respect to Buyer Claims
and Seller Claims, respectively, which arise or result from claims for Damages
made by third parties ("Third-Party Claims") shall be subject to the following
terms and conditions:

(a) The Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of
any such Third-Party Claim, setting forth therein in reasonable detail the
basis for such Third-Party Claim (and will provide such Indemnifying Party
such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request), and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
undertake the defense thereof by counsel chosen by it and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided, that failure to provide such
prompt notice shall not affect the Indemnifying Party's obligations hereunder,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure; and provided, further, that the Indemnified Party will
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in defending such Third-Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes such defense, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall
control such defense.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time after notice of any
such Third-Party Claim, fails to defend the Indemnified Party against which
such Third-Party Claim has been asserted, the Indemnified Party shall (upon
further notice to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the
defense, compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim for the account
and risk of the Indemnifying Party; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall
not settle or compromise such Third-Party Claim without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; and

(c) Any provision in this Article VIII to the contrary notwithstanding, (A) if
(i) there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may materially
and adversely affect the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Third-Party claim
involves criminal Liability or (iii) the Third-Party Claim involves a dispute
with a Governmental Body, the Indemnified Party shall have the absolute right,
at its own cost and expense, to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party
Claim; provided, however, that if such Third-Party Claim is settled without
the Indemnifying Party's consent, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to
have waived all rights hereunder against the Indemnifying Party for Damages
arising out of such Third-Party Claim; and (B) the Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or
compromise any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which
(i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the
plaintiff to the Indemnified Party a release from all Liability in respect to
such Third-Party Claim or (ii) subjects the Indemnified Party to any
injunctive relief or other equitable remedy.



Section 8.07 Limitation on Damages.

(a) Any indemnification payable pursuant to this Article VIII shall be net of:

(i) any amounts actually received (after deducting related costs and expenses)
by the Indemnified Party for the Damages for which such indemnification
payment is made, under any warranty or indemnity from any third party and
under applicable insurance policies; and

(ii) any Tax benefits in excess of Tax detriments actually recognized by the
Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages
in the taxable year such Damage arises or the succeeding taxable year
(calculated on a with or without basis) to the extent such Tax benefits arise
from the deductibility of any such Damages. If the Indemnified Party actually
recognizes a Tax benefit arising from the incurrence or payment of any such
Damages in the taxable year of such Damage or the succeeding taxable year
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any such
indemnification payment made up to the amount received by the Indemnified
Party, net of any expenses (including Taxes) or Tax detriment reasonably
incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

(b) If the Indemnified Party determines not to pursue any such recovery, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly so notify the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnifying Party (in its name or in the name of the Indemnified Party) shall

relieve the assigning Party of any of its obligations hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing, Seller may assign this

representation and warranty, Buyer shall be entitled to rely only on the most
specific representation and warranty addressing such matter. The specification

required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the
Ordinary Course of Business for purposes of this Agreement. The information
contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits
hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party
hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of
law or breach of Contract).



Section 11.07 Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended or waived only in a

provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.



Section 11.08 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to
herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete
agreement between the Parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the Parties, written or oral,

HEREUNDER OR RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE FOREGOING MAY ONLY BE INSTITUTED IN
ALLEGHENY COUNTY COURT OF COMMON PLEAS (UNLESS SUCH COURT SHALL LACK SUBJECT
MATTER JURISDICTION, IN WHICH CASE, IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN
PENNSYLVANIA) AND EACH PARTY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH SUCH PARTY MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, AND IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY SUCH COURT IN
ANY SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS WITH RESPECT THERETO

Section 11.15 Enforcement of Agreement.

(a) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the Closing, the other
Party would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach
of this Agreement by Seller or Buyer could not be adequately compensated in
all cases by monetary Damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other
right or remedy to which any Party may be entitled at law or in equity, before
or after the Closing each Party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of
this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond
or other undertaking. Each of the Parties hereto further agrees that it shall
not object to, or take any position inconsistent with respect to, whether in a
court of law or otherwise, (i) the appropriateness of the specific performance
contemplated by this Section 11.15 and (ii) the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts set forth in Section 11.11 hereof with respect to any action brought
for any such remedy.

(b) Each Party further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this Section 11.15, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to such Party under this
Agreement or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 11.15
are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in
this Section 11.15 shall require any Party to institute any action for (or
limit any Party's right to institute any action for) specific performance
under this Section 11.15 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under Article VII, nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to
this Section 11.15 or anything set forth in this Section 11.15 restrict or
limit any such Party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Article VII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available then or thereafter.
