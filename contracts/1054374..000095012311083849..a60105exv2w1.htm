 (i) _Terminating Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested as of the Effective Time, and that (A) is held by any Person who is not as of immediately prior to the Effective Time an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and that has a per share exercise price less than the Merger Consideration (each such Company Option, a " _Non-Employee Option_ "), (B) is held by an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which employee is a permanent resident of the Peoples Republic of China (each such employee, a " _PRC Employee_ " and each such Company Option, a " _PRC Employee Option_ ")or (C) has a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, (each, an " _Out-of-the-Money Option_ " and together with the Non-Employee Options and the PRC Employee Options, the " _Terminating Options_ "), shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, terminate in its entirety at the Effective Time, and the holder of each Terminating Option shall be entitled to receive therefor an amount of cash, denominated in either United States dollars or with respect any PRC Employee, in the Companys discretion, Chinese yuan (rounded down to the nearest whole cent or fen, as applicable), if any, equal to the product of (X) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise in full of such Company Option _multiplied_ by (Y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such Company Option. For the avoidance of doubt, each Out-of-the-Money Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall terminate in its entirety at the Effective Time and the holder thereof shall not be entitled to receive any consideration pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (ii) _Assumption of Certain Employee Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than Terminating Options shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option denominated in Parent Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") having substantially similar terms and conditions as the Company Option (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "), except that (A) each such Assumed Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (X) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied_ by (Y) a fraction (such ratio, the " _Option Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is 

   ##### 

 

   

the volume weighted average price for a share of Parent Common Stock for the
five (5) trading days immediately prior to (and excluding) the Merger Closing
Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P., and rounding such product down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (B) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing (1) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which
such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (2) the Option Ratio, and rounding such quotient up to the nearest whole
cent. The Company will not take any action to accelerate the vesting of any
Company Options (other than to implement any existing agreements or
arrangements for such acceleration in effect as of the date of this
Agreement). As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent will use all reasonable
best efforts to issue to each Person who holds an Assumed Option a document
evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company Option by Parent. 

   

 (iii) _Terminating Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by any Person who is not as of immediately prior to the Effective Time an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each such Company RSU, a " _Terminating RSU_ ") shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, terminate in its entirety at the Effective Time, and the holder of each Terminating RSU shall be entitled to receive therefor an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (A) the unissued number of  shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied_ by (B) the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (iv) _PRC Employee RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a PRC Employee shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, terminate in its entirety at the Effective Time (" _Cancelled RSUs_ "). Promptly following the Effective Time, the Company shall grant to each PRC Employee a new restricted stock unit of the Company that is economically equivalent to the Cancelled RSUs held by each such PRC Employee. 

   

 (v) _Assumption of Employee RSUs_. At the Effective Time each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than Terminating RSUs and Cancelled RSUs shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into a restricted stock unit denominated in Parent Common Stock having substantially similar terms and conditions as the Company RSU (each, an " _Assumed RSU_ "), except that upon vesting, each such Company RSU will entitle the holder to that number of whole shares of the Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (X) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable with regard to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied_ by (Y) the Option Ratio, and rounding such product down to the nearest whole number of 

   ##### 

  

   

shares of Parent Common Stock. The Company will not take any action to
accelerate the vesting of any Company RSU (other than to implement
any existing agreements or arrangements for such acceleration in effect as of
the date of this Agreement). As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent will
issue to each Person who holds an assumed Company RSU a document evidencing
the foregoing assumption of such Company RSU by Parent.

 (f) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective Time be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. After the Effective Time, each certificate, if any, evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving Corporation or of a stockholder of Parent. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.7(a)_, if any holder of Company Shares who demands appraisal for such shares in accordance with Delaware Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, each of such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in _Section 1.6_, without interest thereon, subject to any withholding of Taxes required under applicable Law, upon surrender of the Certificate representing such shares or transfer of such Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. 

  

 (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal rights of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company which relate to any such demand for appraisal rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings which take place prior to the Effective Time with respect to demands for appraisal rights under Delaware Law.

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a national bank or trust company to act as the paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time represented by a stock certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each non-certificated share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time represented by book-entry (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each instance other than 

   ##### 

  

    

Dissenting Shares, in accordance with this _Article I_ and Parent shall
enter into a customary paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent. 

  

 (b) _Parent to Provide Cash_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Paying Agent for exchange, in accordance with this _Article I_, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the full amount of the cash payable pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_ as Merger Consideration in exchange for outstanding Company Shares. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". 

  

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall otherwise be in customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the cash payable pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_ as Merger Consideration. Upon (X) surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, or (Y) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of record of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, with respect to each Company Share surrendered by such holder, the cash constituting the Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered or Book-Entry Shares so transferred shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered or transferred, outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, respectively, will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which each Company Share represented thereby shall have been so converted. No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares under this Agreement. 

  

 (d) _Required Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, to any holder or former holder of Company Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs or otherwise, such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other provision or under any provision of state, local or non-United States Tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. 

  

 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 1.8_, neither the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar federal, state,

Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Law_ "). 

  

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this _Article I_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this  _Article I_ shall promptly be paid to Parent. 

  

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares six (6) months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of Parent, be delivered to Parent, and any Person entitled to payment in accordance with this _Article I_ shall be entitled to look only to Parent solely as general creditors for any cash (which shall not accrue interest) payable to such Person pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_ as Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Shares held by such Person.

 1.11 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of the Merger.

   ##### 

  

   

 (v) cause the preliminary and definitive Proxy Statements, on each relevant filing date, on the date of mailing to the Companys stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no responsibility with
respect to any information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. Parent and its counsel

prior written consent of Parent other than in the case and to the extent to
which the Company is required to allow additional time to ensure that

if as of the time for which the Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled
(as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such Stockholders Meeting.
Unless this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, pursuant to _Article VII_, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to ensure that any Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof) is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and

The 

   ##### 

  

    

Company agrees that it shall promptly (and in any event within twelve (12)
hours) (i) provide Parent with oral and written notice setting forth all such
information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent currently informed in
all material respects of the status and material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including any negotiations

in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (iii)

 (d) _Permitted Response to Acquisition Proposals_.

 (i) the Company complies with all of the terms of this _Section 5.3_; 

   

 (ii) prior to furnishing or making available any nonpublic information or entering into any negotiations or discussions with such third Person, (1) such third Person is bound to an executed confidentiality agreement with the Company no less restrictive to such third Person with respect to the use or disclosure of nonpublic information than the Confidentiality Agreement is with respect to Parent (including with respect to "non-solicitation" provisions) and (2) contemporaneously with furnishing or making available any such nonpublic information to such third Person, to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished or made available to Parent, copies of such nonpublic information; and 

   

 (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to provide such information or enter into such discussion or negotiations would result in a breach of the Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. 

  

 (e) _Superior Offers_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section 5.3(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, solely in response to the receipt of an unsolicited Superior Offer, the Board of Directors of the Company may (i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ in order to concurrently enter into a definitive binding Acquisition Agreement accepting such Superior Offer or (ii) effect a Change of Recommendation, in the case of clauses (i) or (ii) if all of the following conditions in clauses (A) through (F) are met:

 (D) after delivering the Superior Offer Notice, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement during such three (3)-Business Day period, and negotiate (and shall cause the Companys financial and legal advisors to negotiate) in good faith with respect thereto during such three (3)-Business Day period, to make such changes in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other agreements that may be offered in writing by Parent during the applicable notice period so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Offer or that the cause for the Change of Recommendation ceases to exist, as applicable (it being agreed that any material amendment or modification to the terms of the Superior Offer (including any amendment to any price term thereof), shall require a new Superior Offer Notice and again require compliance with the terms of this _Section 5.3(e)_, except that the additional advance notice period shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days with respect to any such new Superior Offer Notice; 

   

 (E) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, any amendment to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including any increase in the Merger Consideration) and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may be offered in writing by Parent during the applicable notice period and shall have determined (1) after 

   ##### 

  

   

consultation with its financial advisor, that the terms of the Superior Offer
are more favorable to the stockholders of the Company (in their capacities as
stockholders) than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking
into account as it may be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (D) above) and (2)
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take the
applicable action set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of this _Section 5.3(e)_
would result in a breach of the Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; and 

   

 (F) the Company shall not have breached any of the provisions set forth in _Section 5.2_ or this _Section 5.3_ in any material respect in connection with such Superior Offer. 

  

 (f) _Intervening Event Change of Recommendation_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response to an Intervening Event, effect a Change of Recommendation; _provided_ that all of the following conditions in clauses (A) through (D) are met: 

   

 (A) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that such Intervening Event has occurred; 

   

 (B) the Company shall have delivered to Parent prior written notice (an " _Intervening Event Notice_ ") at least four (4) Business Days in advance of its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event which notice shall include information describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail and state expressly (1) that an Intervening Event has occurred and (2) that the Company intends to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event (and provided that any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event shall require a new Intervening Event Notice and again require compliance with the terms of this _Section 5.3(f)_ , except that the additional advance notice period shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days with respect to any such new Intervening Event Notice); 

   

 (C) after delivering the Intervening Event Notice, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement during such four (4)-Business Day period, and negotiate (and shall cause the Companys financial and legal advisors to negotiate) in good faith with respect thereto during 

   ##### 

  

   

such four (4)-Business Day period, to make such changes in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the other agreements that may be offered in
writing by Parent during the notice period so that the cause for the Change
of Recommendation ceases to exist; and 

   

 (D) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, any amendment to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including any increase in the Merger Consideration) and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may be offered in writing by Parent during the applicable notice period and shall have determined after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would result in a breach of the Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law (taking into account any such offered amendments to this Agreement and such other agreements). 

  

 (g) _State Takeover Statute_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not, in connection with any Change of Recommendation, take any action to change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state Law to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.

Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the consummation of the Merger Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Merger Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, its Subsidiaries or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be.

   ##### 

  

    

pocket limitations, to amounts paid during the plan year that included the
Effective Time by such Continuing Employees with respect to similar plans
maintained by Company and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (d) The Company will be responsible for all requisite notices, payments and employee transfers required under any works councils agreements and necessary to consummate the transaction, or as any such actions are requested by Parent.

participant in any Company Employee Plan or any participant in any Parent
Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or

Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions with respect to exculpation, indemnification and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not, except as required by applicable Law, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of Indemnified Parties or any other person who, prior to the Effective Time, was a director or officer of the Company, 

  

 (b) _Insurance_.

   ##### 

  

    

Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the date
hereof and (iv) to the extent the annual premium therefor would not exceed
two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such coverage; _provided_ that if such policy is
not available on such terms, for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain
directors and officers liability insurance with one or more reputable
unaffiliated third Person insurers covering those directors and officers who
are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof for actions and omissions of
such officers and directors (in their capacities as such) occurring prior to
the Effective Time of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to the insured
than those of the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in
effect as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in no event will the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in any one year in excess of two hundred
and fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company
for such coverage (and to the extent annual premium would exceed two hundred
and fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company
for such coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall use all reasonable best
efforts to cause to be maintained the maximum amount of coverage as
is available for such two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of such annual
premium).

On and after the Merger Closing, the obligations of Parent under this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party under this _Section 5.9_ without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party.

Other than with respect to termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_, any termination of this Agreement under _Section 7.1_ above will be effective immediately upon the delivery of a valid written notice of the terminating party to the other party hereto. Any termination of this Agreement under _Section 7.1(g)_ will be effective upon the later of delivery of a valid written notice of the Company to Parent and payment of the Termination Fee described in, and in accordance with _Section 7.3(b)_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect, except (i) as set forth in _Section 5.4(a)_, this  _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII_, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud (each, a " _Covered Breach_ ").

 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_. 

  

 (a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 7.3_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated; _provided_ that Parent and the Company shall share equally the filing fee for the Notification and Report Forms filed with the FTC and DOJ under the HSR Act and for similar initial premerger notification and report forms filed under similar applicable Laws of other jurisdictions, in each case pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_. 

  

 (b) _Company Payment_. 

   

 (i) _Termination Fee_. Other than as set forth below, the Company shall promptly, but (except in the case of clause (B) below) in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of termination pursuant to the sections of this Agreement as set forth below, pay Parent a fee equal to One Hundred Twenty-Seven Million Dollars ($127,000,000) (the " _Termination Fee_ ") in the event that this Agreement is (A) terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_; (B) terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_, _provided_ that in the case of termination under _Section 7.1(g)_, payment of the Termination Fee by the Company shall be made concurrently with such termination, or (C) terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section 7.1(f)_ or _Section 7.1(i)_; _provided_ that in the case of termination pursuant to  _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section 7.1(f)_ (on account of a knowing and intentional breach of one or more covenants and agreements other than _Section 5.2_ or _Section 5.3_) or _Section 7.1(i)_ such payment (1) shall be made only if after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination, there has been disclosure publicly of an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company and within twelve (12) months following 

   ##### 

  

   

the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition of the Company is
consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement with a third
Person with respect to an Acquisition of the Company and (2) shall be made no
later than the earlier of (x) the consummation of such Acquisition of the
Company and (y) twelve (12) months following the termination of
this Agreement; _provided further_ that the Company shall not be excused of
its obligation to pay the Termination Fee by reason of the termination or
abandonment of any such definitive agreement with respect to the Acquisition.
Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 7.3(b)(i)_, no Termination
Fee shall be payable with respect to any termination pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)_ under circumstances where (x) Parents or Merger Subs breach of this
Agreement was the principal cause of the failure of the Merger Closing Date
to occur on or before the End Date, or (y) the condition set forth in
_Section 6.1(c)_ has not been satisfied prior to termination and the
Companys breach of this Agreement was not the principal cause of the failure
of the satisfaction of, _Section 6.1(c)_ on or before the End Date. 

   

 (ii) _Interest and Costs; Other Remedies_. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.3(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this _Section 7.3(b)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in this _Section 7.3(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the reasonable costs and expenses of Parent (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) at the rate two percent (2%) per annum over the United States bank prime rate of interest published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such payment was required (or, if such date is not a publication date, the most recent preceding publication date) from the date such payment was required to be made (or such lesser percentage as is the maximum permitted under applicable Law). Any and all such payment of fees and expenses described in this _Section 7.3(b)_ shall be made by the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent. Payment of the fees and expenses described in this _Section 7.3(b)_ shall not be in lieu of, but shall be credited against, damages incurred in the event of a Covered Breach. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_ shall limit the 

   ##### 

  

   

rights of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company under  _Section 8.8_ (or
otherwise with respect to injunctive or similar relief) or the rights of
Parent or Merger Sub to seek damages under _Section 7.2_ for any Covered
Breach. 

   

 (iii) _Certain Definitions_. For the purposes of this  _Section 7.3(b)_ only, " _Acquisition_ ," with respect to the Company, means a transaction of the type described in the definition of Acquisition Proposal, except that for this purpose each reference to "fifteen percent (15%)" therein shall be deemed to be a reference to "forty percent (40%)". 

  

 7.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after obtaining Stockholder Approval; _provided_ that no such amendment shall be made after the Stockholder Approval which by Delaware Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such further stockholder approval; _provided further_ that this Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. 

  

 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time either party hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed: (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder, including pursuant to  _Section 7.1_, shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such waiver is in writing and is signed by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ that that no such waiver shall be made after the Stockholder Approval which by Delaware Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such further stockholder approval.

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the Merger Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement and

In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.8 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the parties may be entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and covenants not to assert or plead any objection it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 

  

 8.10 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

  

 8.11 _Assignment_. No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties, except that Parent may transfer or assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries at any time; _provided_ that Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ( _provided_ that such assignment shall not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement). No transfer or assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment in violation of this _Section 8.11_ shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
