best interests of Sims and its shareholders. The board of directors of MMI has determined that such
a business combination is advisable and consistent with the long-term business strategies of MMI
and is in the best interests of MMI and its stockholders. The respective boards of directors of
Sims and MMI accordingly have each duly adopted resolutions approving this Agreement and the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Each share of MMI&#146;s Common Stock, par value US$.01 per share (&#147;<U>MMI Common
Stock</U>&#148;), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of MMI Common Stock held in the treasury of MMI, held by any Subsidiary of MMI or
held by Sims or any Subsidiary of Sims) will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive upon the surrender
of the certificate formerly representing such share 2.05 (the &#147;<U>Exchange Ratio</U>&#148;)
American Depositary Shares (&#147;<U>Sims ADSs</U>&#148;), each representing one Ordinary Share of
Sims (a &#147;<U>Sims Ordinary Share</U>&#148;), issued in accordance with a depositary agreement to
be entered into between and among Sims, Bank of New York or other appropriate depositary
selected by Sims, as depositary, and the registered holders from time to time of Sims ADSs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding Sims Ordinary Shares or shares of MMI Common Stock are
changed into a different number of shares or a different class as a result of a stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange,
recapitalization or similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted appropriately.

issued pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of fractional Sims ADSs, cash
payments in United States dollars will be made to the former holders of MMI Common Stock
with respect to any fractional Sims ADS that would otherwise be issuable pursuant to the
Merger in an amount equal to such fractional part of a Sims ADS multiplied by the United
States dollar equivalent of the closing price of one Sims Ordinary Share on the Australian
Stock Exchange (&#147;<U>ASX</U>&#148;) on the last trading day preceding the Closing Date. The
calculation of the United States dollar equivalent of such closing price will be based on
the arithmetic mean of the buy and sell spot rates of exchange for Australian dollars and
United States dollars on the London market at 11:00&nbsp;a.m., London time, on the last trading
day in London preceding the Closing Date. No such holder will be entitled to dividends,
voting rights or any other shareholder right with respect to any fractional Sims ADSs that
such holder, but for the provisions of this Section&nbsp;1.8(c), would be entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;1.8(c), shares held of record by a
particular stockholder of MMI and represented by two or more share certificates may be
aggregated in order to reduce the fractional Sims ADSs issuable to such stockholder.

determines that the issue of Sims ADSs in the jurisdiction of a relevant proposed recipient
of Sims ADSs (other than recipients resident in the United States or any jurisdiction to
which Sims ADSs may be issued pursuant to exemptions from the registration and prospectus
delivery requirements applicable to public offerings of securities to persons in such
jurisdictions) is either prohibited or unduly onerous or impracticable (each such proposed
recipient, an &#147;<U>Ineligible Overseas Stockholder</U>&#148;), Sims will procure that the Sale
Agent will be issued such number of Sims ADSs as are attributable to the Ineligible Overseas
Stockholders as Merger Consideration and will further procure that such Sims ADSs are sold

practicable after the Effective Time. The term &#147;<U>Sale Agent</U>&#148; as used in this

Option</U>&#148;) granted under the Amended and Restated MMI 2002 Incentive Stock Plan or any
other current or former stock option plan, program, agreement or arrangement of MMI or any

Effective Time into an option to purchase Sims ADSs in accordance with a procedure which
satisfies the requirements under Section 424(a) of the Code; provided that to the extent
consistent with satisfying such requirements, each MMI Stock Option will be converted into
an option to purchase that whole number of Sims ADSs that could have been obtained upon the
exercise of such MMI Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and the conversion
and exchange of the shares of MMI Common Stock issued upon such exercise for Sims ADSs as
provided in Section&nbsp;1.8, and the exercise price per share applicable to each such MMI Stock
Option will be adjusted at the Effective Time as appropriate so as to preserve with respect

MMI Common Stock was issued or any other agreement between MMI and the holder thereof, will
upon conversion thereof into a Sims ADS pursuant to the Merger continue to be subject to the
same transfer limitations and vesting provisions, except as specifically provided in the MMI
