AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of September 24, 2007, between and among Sims Group Limited, a corporation organized under the laws of Victoria, Australia (" _Sims_ "), MMI Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sims (the " _Acquisition Corporation_ "), and Metal Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _MMI_ "). 

  

 The board of directors of Sims has determined that a business combination with MMI, to be effected through Simss acquisition by merger of all of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of MMI, is advisable and consistent with the long-term business strategies of Sims and is in the best interests of Sims and its shareholders. The board of directors of MMI has determined that such a business combination is advisable and consistent with the long-term business strategies of MMI and is in the best interests of MMI and its stockholders. The respective boards of directors of Sims and MMI accordingly have each duly adopted resolutions approving this Agreement and the business combination contemplated hereby. 

  

 It is intended that the merger provided for in this Agreement will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the value, receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time the Acquisition Corporation will be merged (the " _Merger_ ") with and into MMI in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Act_ "). Following the Merger, MMI will continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and the separate corporate existence of the Acquisition Corporation will cease. 

  

 Section 1.2 _The Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Baker and McKenzie LLP, One Prudential Plaza, 130 East Randolph Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the second Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7, or at such other date, time or place as Sims and MMI may agree. " _Business Day_ " means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day that is a legal holiday under the laws of the State of New York or the State of New South Wales, or is a day on which banking institutions located in either such state are authorized or required by law or other governmental action to close. The date upon which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger will be consummated by the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the Delaware Act. The Merger will become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware or at such later time as Sims and MMI mutually agree and specify in the certificate of merger. The time the Merger becomes effective in accordance with Sections 103 and 251 of the Delaware Act is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_." 

  

 Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the Delaware Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Effective Time, all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of MMI and the Acquisition Corporation will vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of MMI and the Acquisition Corporation will become debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will be amended in its entirety to read as set forth in  _Exhibit A_ and, as so amended, will be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, unless and until thereafter changed or amended in accordance with the Delaware Act. The bylaws of the Acquisition Corporation will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of the Acquisition Corporation at the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by law. Sims and MMI will agree prior to the Effective Time as to the composition of the board of directors of the Acquisition Corporation as of the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Acquisition Corporation at the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by law. Sims and MMI will agree prior to the Effective Time as to the initial officers of the Acquisition Corporation as of the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 1.8 _Conversion of MMI Common Stock_. 

   

 (a) Each share of MMIs Common Stock, par value US$.01 per share (" _MMI Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of MMI Common Stock held in the treasury of MMI, held by any Subsidiary of MMI or held by Sims or any Subsidiary of Sims) will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive upon the surrender of the certificate formerly representing such share 2.05 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") American Depositary Shares (" _Sims ADSs_ "), each representing one Ordinary Share of Sims (a " _Sims Ordinary Share_ "), issued in accordance with a depositary agreement to be entered into between and among Sims, Bank of New York or other appropriate depositary selected by Sims, as depositary, and the registered holders from time to time of Sims ADSs. 

   

 (b) In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding Sims Ordinary Shares or shares of MMI Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares or a different class as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange, recapitalization or similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted appropriately. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.8(a), no fractional Sims ADSs will be issued pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of fractional Sims ADSs, cash payments in United States dollars will be made to the former holders of MMI Common Stock with respect to any fractional Sims ADS that would otherwise be issuable pursuant to the Merger in an amount equal to such fractional part of a Sims ADS multiplied by the United States dollar equivalent of the closing price of one Sims Ordinary Share on the Australian Stock Exchange (" _ASX_ ") on the last trading day preceding the Closing Date. The calculation of the United States dollar equivalent of such closing price will be based on the arithmetic mean of the buy and sell spot rates of exchange for Australian dollars and United States dollars on the London market at 11:00 a.m., London time, on the last trading day in London preceding the Closing Date. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other shareholder right with respect to any fractional Sims ADSs that such holder, but for the provisions of this Section 1.8(c), would be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger. For purposes of this Section 1.8(c), shares held of record by a particular stockholder of MMI and represented by two or more share certificates may be aggregated in order to reduce the fractional Sims ADSs issuable to such stockholder. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (d) Each share of MMI Common Stock held in the treasury of MMI, held by any Subsidiary of MMI or held by Sims or any Subsidiary of Sims immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled and retired and will cease to exist. For purposes of this Section 1.8(d), shares of MMI Common Stock owned beneficially or held of record by any plan, program or arrangement sponsored or maintained for the benefit of any current or former director, officer or employee of MMI, Sims or any of their respective Subsidiaries will not be deemed to be held by MMI, Sims or any such Subsidiary, regardless of whether MMI, Sims or any such Subsidiary has the power, directly or indirectly, to vote or control the disposition of such shares. 

   

 (e) The Sims ADSs to be issued upon the conversion of shares of MMI Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.8(a) and the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional Sims ADSs pursuant to Section 1.8(c) are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the " _Merger Consideration_." 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 1.8, where Sims reasonably determines that the issue of Sims ADSs in the jurisdiction of a relevant proposed recipient of Sims ADSs (other than recipients resident in the United States or any jurisdiction to which Sims ADSs may be issued pursuant to exemptions from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements applicable to public offerings of securities to persons in such jurisdictions) is either prohibited or unduly onerous or impracticable (each such proposed recipient, an " _Ineligible Overseas Stockholder_ "), Sims will procure that the Sale Agent will be issued such number of Sims ADSs as are attributable to the Ineligible Overseas Stockholders as Merger Consideration and will further procure that such Sims ADSs are sold and the proceeds of sale paid to the Ineligible Overseas Stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time. The term " _Sale Agent_ " as used in this Agreement means the person nominated by Sims to sell the Sims ADSs that are attributable to the Ineligible Overseas Stockholders under the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (g) The term " _Subsidiary_ " as used in this Agreement means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business entity more than 50% of the outstanding voting equity securities of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by MMI or Sims, as applicable. 

  

 Section 1.9 _MMI Stock Options and Warrants_. 

   

 (a) MMI will use reasonable best efforts (including obtaining all necessary consents of current and former directors, officers and employees of MMI and its Subsidiaries) to permit each outstanding stock option to acquire shares of MMI Common Stock (each, a " _MMI Stock Option_ ") granted under the Amended and Restated MMI 2002 Incentive Stock Plan or any other current or former stock option plan, program, agreement or arrangement of MMI or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _MMI Stock Plans_ ") to be converted at the Effective Time into an option to purchase Sims ADSs in accordance with a procedure which satisfies the requirements under Section 424(a) of the Code; provided that to the extent consistent with satisfying such requirements, each MMI Stock Option will be converted into an option to purchase that whole number of Sims ADSs that could have been obtained upon the exercise of such MMI Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and the conversion and exchange of the shares of MMI Common Stock issued upon such exercise for Sims ADSs as provided in Section 1.8, and the exercise price per share applicable to each such MMI Stock Option will be adjusted at the Effective Time as appropriate so as to preserve with respect to each option to purchase Sims ADSs the excess of the fair market value of each share of MMI Common Stock subject to the corresponding MMI Stock Option immediately before the Effective Time over the option price for such share of MMI Common Stock. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, each share of MMI Common Stock, if any, issued pursuant to any MMI Stock Plan that is subject to transfer limitations or vesting provisions under the terms of such MMI Stock Plan, or under any individual grant agreement pursuant to which such MMI Common Stock was issued or any other agreement between MMI and the holder thereof, will upon conversion thereof into a Sims ADS pursuant to the Merger continue to be subject to the same transfer limitations and vesting provisions, except as specifically provided in the MMI Stock Plans or any MMI restricted stock certificate. 

   ##### 

  

    

Any cash which would have been payable under Section 1.8(c) will be paid to
the holder of such MMI Common Stock without regard to any such transfer
limitations or vesting provisions. 

   

 (c) MMI will use reasonable best efforts (including obtaining all necessary consents of current and former directors, officers and employees of MMI and its Subsidiaries) to permit MMI, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, to cancel each outstanding stock purchase warrant and other right to purchase or otherwise acquire shares of MMI Common Stock (each, a " _MMI Warrant_ ") granted under the MMI Equity Incentive Plan or any other current or former plan, program, agreement or arrangement of MMI or any of its Subsidiaries providing for the issuance of stock purchase warrants or similar rights (collectively, the " _MMI Warrant Plans_ ") (i) in exchange for the issuance to the holders of MMI Warrants of shares of MMI Common Stock, the number of which with respect to each MMI Warrant will be determined by dividing the (A) the excess of (1) the fair market value of the total number of shares of MMI Common Stock for which such MMI Warrant is then exercisable, determined based on the closing price of a share of MMI Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, over (2) the aggregate exercise price of such MMI Warrant by (B) the closing price of a share of MMI Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date or (ii) if MMI is unable to obtain any such consent from any current or former director, officer or employee of MMI or its Subsidiaries, then in exchange for the issuance of warrants to purchase Sims ADSs to such holder of MMI Warrants and such exchange will be effected in accordance with a procedure that will result in the exchange being exempt from taxation under Section 409A of the Code. 

   

 (d) The board of directors or compensation committee of MMI will grant all approvals and take all other actions reasonably required pursuant to Rule 16b-3(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") thereunder, the " _Securities Exchange Act_ "), to cause the disposition in the Merger of MMI Common Stock, MMI Stock Options and MMI Warrants held by affiliates of MMI to be exempt from the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act. 

   

 (e) No additional MMI Stock Options or MMI Warrants will be granted or issued pursuant to the MMI Stock Plans or MMI Warrant Plans after the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 1.10 _Conversion of Acquisition Corporation Common Stock_. Each share of the Common Stock, par value US$.01 per share, of the Acquisition Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into one share of the Common Stock, par value US$.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

All premiums or other payments for all periods ending on or before the Effective Time have been paid with respect to each such MMI Plan; 

   

 (iv) each MMI Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or to receive favorable tax or other treatment under applicable law has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service that it is qualified under Code Section 401(a) and that its related trust is exempt from federal income tax under Code Section 501(a) or has received proper evidence from the appropriate governmental entity to the effect that such plan will receive such favorable tax or other treatment under applicable law. To MMIs knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that will or could give rise to disqualification or loss of tax-exempt status of any such MMI Plan or trust or which would result in the loss of any other such favorable tax or other treatment under applicable law; 

   

 (v) the market value of assets under each such MMI Plan which is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan (other than any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ")) and a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) equals or exceeds the value of all vested and nonvested liabilities thereunder determined in accordance with Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation methods, factors and assumptions applicable to an employee pension benefit plan terminating on the date for determination; 

   

 (vi) MMI has made available to Sims accurate and complete copies of all actuarial reports, appraisals and other documents in its possession relating to the funding of such MMI Plans;

 (c) With respect to each Employee Welfare Benefit Plan or Employee Pension Benefit Plan that MMI or any of its Subsidiaries maintains or ever has maintained, or to which any of them contributes, ever has contributed or ever has been required to contribute, and except for matters which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a MMI Material Adverse Effect: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) MMI has no liability with respect to any such Employee Pension Benefit Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan) which is a defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) and has been terminated;

None of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will trigger any withdrawal or termination liability under any Multiemployer Plan or Other Collective Bargained Plan set forth in the MMI Disclosure Letter. To MMIs knowledge, the withdrawal liability under all Multiemployer Plans and Other Collectively Bargained Plans to which MMI or any of its Subsidiaries contributes would not produce a MMI Material Adverse Effect if triggered simultaneously as of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) Neither MMI nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or ever has maintained, or contributes, ever has contributed or ever has been required to contribute to any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan providing medical, health, life insurance or other welfare benefits for current or future retired or terminated employees, their spouses or their dependents (other than in accordance with Section 4980B of the Code). 

   

 (f) No MMI Plan contains any provision that would prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, would give rise to any severance, termination or other payments as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or together with the occurrence of any other event), or would cause any payment, acceleration or increase in benefits provided by any MMI Plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or together with the occurrence of any other event).

 _ARTICLE 6_  

   

 The corporation shall have perpetual existence. 

  

 _ARTICLE 7_  

   

 In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of the corporation; provided, however, that such authorization shall not divest the stockholders of the power or limit the power of the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of the corporation. 

  

 _ARTICLE 8_  

   

 Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware, as the bylaws of the corporation may provide. The books of the corporation may be kept outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the board of directors or in the bylaws of the corporation. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the bylaws of the corporation so provide. 

  

 _ARTICLE 9_  

   

 (a) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, has no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, has reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 

  

 (b) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.  ##### 

 

 

-4-  

 (c) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. 

  

 (d) Any indemnification under subparagraphs (a) and (b) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subparagraphs (a) and (b). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders. 

  

 (e) Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article 9. 

  

 (f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subparagraphs of this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. 

  

 (g) The Corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article 9. 

  

 (h) For purposes of this Article 9, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article 9 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. 

  

 (i) For purposes of this Article 9, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to  #####

have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation"
as referred to in this Article 9. 

  

 (j) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article 9 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 

  

 _ARTICLE 10_  

   

 A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. 

  

 Any repeal or modification of this Article 10 shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.
