Article 1 
DEFINITIONS AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION

 



 

Definitions

 

. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the respective
meanings assigned thereto in Exhibit C attached hereto and incorporated herein
for all purposes of this Agreement (such definitions to be equally applicable

All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant thereto unless
otherwise defined therein. Unless otherwise specified, all references herein
to "Articles," "Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" or "Schedules" are to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits, Annexes or Schedules of this Agreement. The
words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by
the phrase "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereunder"
and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be
construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The word "or" will have the inclusive meaning
represented by the phrase "and/or." "Shall" and "will" mean "must," and shall
and will have equal force and effect and express an obligation. "Writing,"

not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

dollars. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. Each Party acknowledges that this Agreement was jointly negotiated
and drafted by the Parties with the benefit of representation by legal
counsel, and any rule of construction or interpretation otherwise requiring
this Agreement to be construed or interpreted against any Party shall not
apply to any construction or interpretation hereof. References in this

The Merger

 

. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in
accordance with the DGCL and, to the extent applicable, the CCC, at the

until the Closing, but the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction or, if
permissible, waiver of those conditions), or at such other place or in such
other manner or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually
agree in writing. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date." Concurrently with the Closing,

incorporation shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 

(b)The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at
the Effective Time to read the same as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that all references therein to
the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to the name "Spinal
Kinetics, Inc."), and, as so amended and restated, such bylaws shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided in such bylaws or in the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation or by applicable Law.

 

3

until the earlier of his or her resignation, removal or death or until his or
her successor is duly elected and qualified, as the case may be, in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
and applicable Law. The officers of Merger Sub shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation and each such initial officer shall hold office

portion of the Closing Merger Consideration as set forth on the Payout
Schedule, and (y) a contingent right to receive (without interest and subject
to applicable Tax withholding) the applicable portion of the Contingent
Consideration as set forth on the Payout Schedule, as the same may be updated
from time to time in accordance with Section 6.15(d), with such contingent
right to receive such applicable portion of the Contingent Consideration being
subject to, and with such applicable portion of the Contingent Consideration

to and in accordance with Section 4.3(b) of such VLL Warrant), (ii) the MS
Warrant, if then outstanding and unexercised (in whole or in part), shall be
deemed exercised as to all shares of Series C Preferred Stock subject thereto

(iii) the SVB Warrant, if then outstanding and unexercised (in whole or in
part), shall expire (without any consideration therefor) in accordance with

right to purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation (or to otherwise receive any

redeemed or repaid (as the case may be) on the Closing Date pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms thereof (including, in the case of any 2016 Bridge
Note, Section 1(d) thereof, or, in the case of the De Novo Standalone Note,
Section 3 thereof) and Section 3.11(a), or (ii) be converted, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, into shares of Series C Preferred Stock at the
applicable conversion price specified in such Convertible Note pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms thereof (including, in the case of any 2016
Bridge Note, Section 3(b) thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, (A) any shares
of Series C Preferred Stock issued upon conversion of a Convertible Note
pursuant to clause (ii) of the foregoing sentence shall, for all purposes
hereunder, be issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and shall be subject to cancellation, extinguishment and conversion at the
Effective Time pursuant to and in accordance with Section 3.1 (and the holder
of such shares shall constitute a Stockholder for all purposes hereunder), and
(B) without limiting the foregoing, no Convertible Note shall be converted
into a right to a receive, or otherwise entitle the holder of such Convertible
Note to receive, any portion of the Merger Consideration.

provisions in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Equityholders, each Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and not exercised, whether or not then exercisable or vested,
shall, by virtue of this Agreement and the applicable Company Equity Plan and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled,
extinguished and terminated and converted into and become (i) a right

portion, if any, for the avoidance of doubt, shall consist of the portion of
the Closing Merger Consideration that would be payable in respect of the
shares of Common Stock for which such Stock Option is exercisable as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, net of the applicable aggregate
exercise price with respect to such Stock Option), and (ii) a

 

5  

contingent right following the Effective Time to receive (without interest and
subject to applicable Tax withholding) the applicable portion of the
Contingent Consideration, if any, as set forth on the Payout Schedule, as the
same may be updated from time to time in accordance with Section 6.15(d)
(which applicable portion, if any, for the avoidance of doubt, shall consist
of the portion of such Contingent Consideration that would be payable in
respect of the shares of Common Stock for which such Stock Option is
exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, net of any
remaining portion of the applicable aggregate exercise price with respect to
such Stock Option, after taking into account prior netting in the
determination of Closing Merger Consideration or Contingent Consideration
payable in respect of such Stock Option), with such contingent right to
receive such applicable portion of the Contingent Consideration being subject
to, and with such applicable portion of the Contingent Consideration being
payable in accordance with, the provisions of this Article 3, Article 9 and
the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, (A) each Stock Option with an applicable aggregate exercise price that
is equal to or in excess of the portion of the Merger Consideration that would
be payable in respect of the shares of Common Stock for which such Stock
Option is exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled, extinguished and terminated at the Effective Time for no
consideration; and (B) Parent will not assume any Stock Options. As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all action that may be necessary or required
(under any Company Equity Plan, any applicable Law, the applicable stock
option award agreements or otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 3.2(d) and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, each
holder of an outstanding Stock Option cancelled, extinguished and terminated
as provided in this Section 3.2(d) shall have no rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the consideration specified in this Section
3.2(d), if any.

of Series D Preferred Stock held by such Series D Holder, (iii) terminate each
Warrant as of the Effective Time and ensure that from and after the Effective
Time no holder thereof shall have any Warrants or other rights to purchase
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or any other equity interest in the
Company, (iv) ensure that from and after the Effective Time no Convertible
Note shall remain outstanding and no holder of any Convertible Note shall have
any right to acquire or otherwise receive shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock or any other equity interest in the Company (subject to Parent's
compliance with its obligations under Section 3.11(a) with respect to such
Convertible Note, if any), and (v) terminate each Company Equity Plan and each
Warrant as of the Effective Time and ensure that from and after the Effective
Time no employee or other service provider of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any participant under the Company Equity Plans or otherwise
shall have any Stock Options or other rights to purchase shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock or any other equity interest in the Company (in each
case of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), without the
creation of any additional Liability of the Company).

 

Capital Stock of Merger Sub

 

.

 

 At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of
Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01, of the

 

6  

Surviving Corporation (the "Surviving Corporation Common Stock"), and shall
thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate representing
shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall continue after the Effective Time to
represent shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

 

Parent to Provide Closing Merger Consideration; Surrender and Exchange of
Certificates; Escrow Amount

 

.

 

(a)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Closing,
in no event shall the aggregate consideration payable or allocable to holders
of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Warrants or Stock Options by Parent or
Merger Sub exceed the Closing Merger Consideration.

 

(b)Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate Acquiom Financial LLC,
a Colorado limited liability company, or such other bank or trust company
designated by Parent that is reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as
the payments administrator in the Merger (the "Payments Administrator")
pursuant to the terms of the Payments Agreement.

 

(c)On the Closing Date, promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Payments Administrator cash in the amount necessary to pay to
each Stockholder (other than any holder of Dissenting Shares) the applicable
portion of the Closing Merger Consideration payable to such Stockholder in
respect of its shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, as set forth in the
Payout Schedule. At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time, all cash deposited with the Payments Administrator pursuant to this
Section 3.4(c) that remains undistributed to Stockholders shall be delivered
to Parent upon demand, and thereafter such Stockholders shall be entitled to
look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for payment, upon due surrender of
their Certificates, with respect to the applicable portion of the Closing
Merger Consideration payable to such Stockholders in respect of their shares
of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, as set forth in the Payout Schedule. Any portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed immediately prior to the
date on which it would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(d)Promptly following the Effective Time, the Payments Administrator shall
mail or deliver (or cause to be mailed or delivered) a letter of transmittal
(the "Transmittal Letter") to each holder of record of a stock certificate or
certificates (the "Certificates") that represented outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock or Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any such holder that held only Redeemed Series D Shares). The
Transmittal Letter shall specify that delivery of shares of Common Stock and
Preferred Stock shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Payments Administrator and shall contain instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the payment of the applicable
portion of the Closing Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares
of Common Stock or Preferred Stock represented thereby, as set forth in the
Payout Schedule. The Transmittal Letter shall also include a consent to the
appointment and authority of the Equityholders' Representative as set forth
herein. Promptly upon the later of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the
surrender to the Payments Administrator of a Certificate, together with a

 

7  

Transmittal Letter, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
the instructions thereto (collectively, the "Exchange Documents"), the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive (and Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Payments Administrator to distribute to such
holder) in exchange therefor payment by Automated Clearing House (ACH)
transfer (or, at the election of such holder and for a processing fee not to
exceed twenty-five dollars ($25) per check or per wire transfer to be deducted
from such payment, by check or by wire transfer of immediately available
funds) of the cash amount equal to the applicable portion of the Closing
Merger Consideration payable to such Stockholder in respect of its shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate, as set forth
in the Payout Schedule, after giving effect to any required withholding Taxes,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so
surrendered, after the Effective Time (except as otherwise provided in Section
3.7 with respect to Dissenting Shares), each Certificate shall be deemed, for
all corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive the
consideration provided for in this Article 3. No portion of the Merger
Consideration shall be paid to any Stockholder until the holder of record of a
Certificate has surrendered such Certificate and delivered the Exchange
Documents pursuant hereto.

 

(e)Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall disburse to the Surviving
Corporation the amount necessary to pay to each Optionholder the applicable
portion of the Closing Merger Consideration payable to such Optionholder in
respect of its Stock Options pursuant to Section 3.2, as set forth in the
Payout Schedule. Promptly thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to
be disbursed (i) to each Optionholder with respect to which the Company has a
Tax withholding obligation, through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system
the amount equal to the applicable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration
payable to such Optionholder in respect of his or her Stock Options, as set
forth in the Payout Schedule, after giving effect to any required withholding
Taxes and (ii) to each Optionholder with respect to which the Company has no
Tax withholding obligation, the amount equal to the applicable portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration payable to such Optionholder in respect of his or
her Stock Options, as set forth in the Payout Schedule.

 

(f)Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Payments Administrator shall be
entitled to rely entirely on the information contained in the Payout Schedule,
any Updated Payout Schedule and any Exchange Documents delivered hereunder for
purposes of satisfying Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's respective
obligations to deliver any and all portions of the Merger Consideration
payable hereunder.

 

(g)On the Closing Date, promptly after the Effective Time, and subject to and
in accordance with the provisions of Article 9, Parent shall pay to (i) the
Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount to be deposited into an escrow fund (the
"Escrow Fund") and (ii) the Equityholders' Representative the Expense Amount
to be held by the Equityholders' Representative in a segregated account (the
"Expense Fund") in accordance with the terms of Section 9.5(d). The Escrow
Fund shall be held in escrow and, as provided in Article 9, shall be available
to compensate Parent Indemnified Persons and shall otherwise be distributed
pursuant to Section 9.4 to the Equityholders. The Escrow Fund shall be
reduced from time to time in accordance with Section 3.8, Section 6.11,
Article 9 and Section 10.2, and shall be increased from time to time by the
amount of any interest, dividends, earnings and other income received in
respect of the amounts therein in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The
Parties agree that payments from the Escrow Fund to Stockholders will be
treated for tax purposes as deferred payments of purchase price, except to the
extent treated as payments of interest pursuant to Section 483 or Section 1274
of the Code.

 

8  

(h)If any portion of the cash payment pursuant to Section 3.1 is to be paid to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition to such payment that
(i) the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer, (ii) the signatures on such Certificate or any
related stock power shall be properly guaranteed, and (iii) the Person
requesting such exchange will have (A) paid any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of such payment in a name other than the registered holder
of the Certificate surrendered or (B) established to the satisfaction of
Parent, or any agent designated by Parent, that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. 

 

(i)The Parties understand and agree that (i) the contingent rights to receive
any Contingent Consideration will not be represented by any form of
certificate, are not transferable, except by operation of Laws relating to
descent and distribution, divorce and community property, and do not
constitute an equity or ownership interest in Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, (ii) no Equityholder shall have any rights as a security holder
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent as a result of such Equityholder's
contingent right to receive any Contingent Consideration hereunder and (iii)
no interest is payable with respect to any Contingent Consideration.

 

(j)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Payments Administrator, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation (or
any Affiliate thereof) shall be liable to a holder of a Certificate for any
amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. 

 

(k)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any of Parent,
the Payments Administrator or the Surviving Corporation (pursuant to Parent's
request) will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Equityholder such amounts
as Parent, the Payments Administrator or the Surviving Corporation shall
determine in good faith are required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of federal,
state, local or foreign Laws relating to Taxes. Such deducted and withheld
amounts remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Equityholders in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Payments Administrator or the Surviving Corporation.

 

Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock

 

.

 

 The applicable consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article 3 (including the
contingent right to receive payment of the Contingent Consideration, if any)
shall be in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Preferred Stock and
Common Stock (including any rights to receive accumulated but undeclared
dividends, if any). At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock outstanding prior to
the Effective Time on the records of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing ownership
of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock outstanding prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as applicable (including any rights to
receive accumulated but undeclared dividends, if any), except as otherwise
specifically provided for herein. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate
thereof) for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article 3.

 

9  

Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates

 

.

 



 

In the event any Certificates representing Preferred Stock or Common Stock
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payments Administrator shall
pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an acceptable affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and the
delivery of such other documents reasonably requested by the Payments
Administrator, the applicable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration
payable to such holder in respect of the shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock represented by such Certificate, as set forth in the Payout Schedule;
provided, however, that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to (a) execute and deliver an indemnity agreement with
respect to such Certificate in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and (b)
post a bond in such reasonable amount and on such customary terms as Parent
may direct as indemnity against any Claim that may be made against Parent or
the Payments Administrator with respect to such Certificate.

 

Dissenting Shares

 

.

 

 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Preferred Stock or Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are held by any Stockholder (a) who has not voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing, (b) who is otherwise
entitled to, and who has perfected, appraisal rights for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such rights, "Appraisal Rights") or,
if applicable, dissenters' rights for such shares in accordance with Chapter
13 of the CCC (such rights, "Dissenters' Rights"; and Section 262 of the DGCL
and Chapter 13 of the CCC, collectively, the "Appraisal Rights Statutes"), and
(c) who has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such Appraisal Rights or
Dissenters' Rights, shall not be converted in accordance with this Article 3
into the right to receive the consideration specified in Section 3.1, but
rather the holders of such shares ("Dissenting Shares") shall be entitled only
to such rights as may be granted to such holders in the Appraisal Rights
Statutes; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw, or lose the right to appraisal under the
applicable Appraisal Rights Statutes, or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by the
applicable Appraisal Rights Statutes, then the rights of such holder pursuant
to the applicable Appraisal Rights Statutes shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to represent only the right to receive, the consideration specified in
this Article 3 (without interest thereon), subject in all respects to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Company
shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any demand for appraisal received by
the Company, any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of any such demand, and
any other notice, instrument, or document delivered to the Company pursuant to
the DGCL or CCC relating to appraisal of any shares of Preferred Stock or
Common Stock, which notice shall include a copy of such demand, withdraw, or
other notice, instrument or document. The Company shall provide Parent with
the opportunity to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL or the CCC, and shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, no Redeemed Series D Share shall
be entitled to Appraisal Rights or Dissenters' Rights, as such shares will be
redeemed at or prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 8 of the
Charter and will not be subject to conversion in the Merger. 

 

Purchase Price Adjustment

 

.

 

(a)Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company will deliver to Parent (i) an unaudited balance sheet reasonably
acceptable to Parent prepared by the

 

10  

Company in a manner consistent with the preparation of the balance sheets
included in the most recent Financial Statements, reflecting a good faith
estimate of the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date (the "Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet"), and (ii) based on the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet, a written statement reasonably acceptable to Parent (the "Estimated
Closing Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail the Company's good
faith estimate of the following as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing
Date, accompanied by any supporting documentation relevant to such
calculation: (A) Working Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital"), (B) Debt
Pay-Off Amount (the "Estimated Debt Pay-Off Amount"), (C) unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Company Transaction Expenses"), and (D)
Cash (the "Estimated Cash"). The Estimated Working Capital and other items
set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance
with the Accounting Rules. The items set forth on the Estimated Closing
Statement shall be used to calculate the Closing Merger Consideration.

 

(b)Promptly following the Closing Date, but in no event later than ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, Parent will prepare and submit to the
Equityholders' Representative a written statement (the "Closing Date
Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail Parent's calculation of the
following as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date, accompanied by
any supporting documentation relevant to such calculation: (i) Working Capital
(the "Proposed Final Working Capital"), (ii) Debt Pay-Off Amount (the
"Proposed Final Debt Pay-Off Amount"), (iii) unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses (the "Proposed Final Company Transaction Expenses"), and (iv) Cash
(the "Proposed Final Cash"). The Proposed Final Working Capital, Proposed
Final Debt Pay-Off Amount, Proposed Final Company Transaction Expenses and
Proposed Final Cash set forth on the Closing Date Statement shall be prepared
in accordance with the Accounting Rules. If the Equityholders' Representative
disputes or objects to the calculation of the Proposed Final Working Capital,
Proposed Final Debt Pay-Off Amount, Proposed Final Company Transaction
Expenses, or Proposed Final Cash set forth on the Closing Date Statement, the
Equityholders' Representative will notify Parent in writing (such written
notification being the "Objection Notice") of its disputes or objections no
later than thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Date Statement and
will set forth, in reasonable detail in the Objection Notice, the reasons for
the Equityholders' Representative's objections. If the Equityholders'
Representative fails to deliver an Objection Notice within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Closing Date Statement, the Equityholders will be deemed
to have accepted the Proposed Final Working Capital, Proposed Final Debt Pay-
Off Amount, Proposed Final Company Transaction Expenses and Proposed Final
Cash as set forth on the Closing Date Statement, and such amounts shall be
deemed to be the Final Working Capital, Final Debt Pay-Off Amount, Final
Company Transaction Expenses and Final Cash (respectively) for all purposes
hereunder. If the Equityholders' Representative delivers an Objection Notice
within such thirty (30) day period, the Equityholders' Representative and
Parent will endeavor in good faith to resolve any disputed matters no later
than fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by Parent of the Equityholders'
Representative's Objection Notice. If the Equityholders' Representative and
Parent are unable to resolve the disputed matters in accordance with the
preceding sentence, the Equityholders' Representative and Parent will appoint
the Neutral Auditor to resolve the remaining matters in dispute in accordance
with Section 3.8(c). The fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor shall be
allocated between Parent and the Equityholders' Representative (on behalf of
the Equityholders) based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to each of Parent and the Equityholders' Representative,
respectively, bears to the total contested amount actually submitted to the
Neutral Auditor for resolution pursuant to this Section 3.8(b). The Working
Capital, Debt Pay-Off Amount, the Company Transaction Expenses and Cash as of
12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date, as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 3.8(b) or Section 3.8(c), are

 

11  

referred to herein as the "Final Working Capital", "Final Debt Pay-Off
Amount", "Final Company Transaction Expenses", and "Final Cash" respectively.

 

(c)If the disputed matters referenced in Section 3.8(b) are submitted to the
Neutral Auditor in accordance with Section 3.8(b), the provisions of this
Section 3.8(c) shall apply. Each Party agrees to promptly execute a
reasonable engagement letter, if requested to do so by the Neutral Auditor.
The Neutral Auditor shall be provided with such information and records, which
may include on-site access and access to personnel, relating to such dispute
as it may reasonably request, and Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative, and their respective representatives, shall cooperate fully
with the Neutral Auditor; provided that neither Parent nor the Equityholders'
Representative will meet separately with the Neutral Auditor with respect to
such disputed matters or any other matters contemplated by this Agreement.
The Neutral Auditor shall have the rights, powers and privileges of an
arbitrator and shall resolve only such items that are in dispute and determine
the values to be ascribed thereto, and using those values (together with other
items not in dispute) determine the Working Capital, Debt Pay-Off Amount,
Company Transaction Expenses and Cash as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the
Closing Date only (prepared in accordance with the Accounting Rules). Parent
and the Equityholders' Representative hereby agree that the Neutral Auditor
shall only decide the specific disputed items, the values ascribed thereto and
using those values (together with the other items included in the Closing Date
Statement) determine the Working Capital, Debt Pay-Off Amount, Company
Transaction Expenses and Cash as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing
Date, and the Neutral Auditor's decision with respect to such disputed items
and values must be within the range of values assigned to each such item in
the applicable Closing Date Statement and the Objection Notice, respectively.
The Neutral Auditor shall be directed to resolve such disputes, determine such
values, calculate the Working Capital, Debt Pay-Off Amount, Company
Transaction Expenses and Cash as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing
Date (in accordance with this Section 3.8(c)) and deliver a written
determination of the Working Capital, Debt Pay-Off Amount, Company Transaction
Expenses and Cash as of the Closing Date within thirty (30) days after being
retained as provided in this Section 3.8(c), which determination will be
final, binding and conclusive on the Equityholders' Representative, the
Equityholders and Parent, and their respective Affiliates, representatives,
successors and assigns for all purposes of this Agreement. The Neutral
Auditor's written determination of the Working Capital, Debt Pay-Off Amount,
Company Transaction Expenses and Cash as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the
Closing Date shall include a schedule setting forth all material calculations
used in arriving at such determination and shall be based solely on
information provided to the Neutral Auditor by Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative in accordance herewith. 

 

(d)If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative number and the
absolute value of the Final Closing Adjustment Amount exceeds Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000), then an amount equal to the amount by which the absolute
value of the Final Closing Adjustment Amount exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars
($50,000) shall be paid to Parent from the Escrow Fund. Any amounts payable
to Parent pursuant to this Section 3.8(d) will be made not later than ten (10)
Business Days after the determination of the Final Working Capital, Final Debt
Pay-Off Amount, Final Company Transaction Expenses and Final Cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in advance in
writing by Parent. If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive

(b)In the event that the Merger is consummated, as additional consideration

Corporation pursuant to Section 3.10(f) and Article 9 hereof, after the
Effective Time the Equityholders shall be entitled to receive Earnout
Consideration when and if required to be paid in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 3.9 and Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.10. The Earnout
Consideration shall not bear interest. For the avoidance of doubt, each of
the FDA Milestone Consideration, the First Revenue Milestone Consideration,
and the Second Revenue Milestone Consideration shall be payable only once upon
the first achievement of the corresponding FDA Milestone, First Revenue
Milestone, and Second Revenue Milestone, respectively, and no amounts shall be
due or payable for subsequent or repeated achievement of the FDA Milestone,
First Revenue Milestone or Second Revenue Milestone

 

(c)Each of Parent, the Company and the Equityholders' Representative hereby
acknowledges that the achievement of the First Revenue Milestone, the Second
Revenue Milestone Consideration and the FDA Milestone is uncertain and that
the Surviving Corporation may not achieve results requiring the payment of any
First Revenue Milestone Consideration, Second Revenue Milestone Consideration
or FDA Milestone Consideration at all, and it is therefore not assured that
Parent will be required to pay any First Revenue Milestone Consideration,
Second Revenue Milestone Consideration or FDA Milestone Consideration at all.

 

(d)Subject to the terms of this Section 3.9(d), Parent, as the sole
stockholder of the Surviving Corporation, and the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Corporation, shall have sole discretion over all matters relating to
the Surviving Corporation and the Specified Products after the Effective Time,
including any research, development, regulatory, marketing, manufacturing,
distribution and sales decisions. Although Parent has a present intention to
continue the operations of the Surviving Corporation during the Earnout Period
(including the development, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and sale of
the Specified Products and efforts to seek the FDA M6-C Approval), the Parties
acknowledge that Parent has no obligation to operate the Surviving Corporation
(or to operate its own business, or cause its Affiliates to operate their
respective businesses) in order to cause the achievement of the First Revenue
Milestone, Second Revenue

 

15  

Milestone or FDA Milestone or to maximize the Earnout Consideration or any
element thereof; provided, however, that Parent hereby agrees that during the
Earnout Period (i) it shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to achieve the
Milestones, (ii) it shall not take any actions in bad faith concerning the
operations of the Surviving Corporation with the intention of avoiding
Parent's obligations to make payment of any Earnout Consideration hereunder,
and (iii) it shall not discontinue the marketing, manufacturing, distribution
or sales of any of the Specified Products, or withdraw Premarket Approval
Application, P170036, for the M6-C Disc, during the Earnout Period if it does
not possess a valid commercial reason or legal reason for doing so (which
reason may not be solely to avoid payment of the Earnout Consideration). The
Parties acknowledge that circumstances may exist that (A) prevent or delay the
achievement of the FDA Milestone, thereby eliminating, or reducing the amount
of, the FDA Milestone Consideration, (B) prevent the achievement of financial
results requiring payment of the First Revenue Milestone Consideration or the
Second Revenue Milestone Consideration, or (C) limit, reduce or otherwise
negatively impact Product Revenue during the Earnout Period and each Trailing
Twelve Month Period, thereby eliminating the First Revenue Milestone
Consideration or the Second Revenue Milestone Consideration. Accordingly,
except as expressly provided in Section 3.9(d)(i) above, nothing herein shall
be deemed to be an agreement on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation to (I) obtain, or otherwise cause the issuance of, the
FDA M6-C Approval during the Earnout Period (or by any particular date), or at
all, or (II) achieve financial results or Product Revenue requiring the
payment of the First Revenue Milestone Consideration or the Second Revenue
Milestone Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, and in consideration of
the Closing Merger Consideration to be paid to the Equityholders promptly
after the Effective Time, except as expressly provided in Section 3.9(d)(i)
above, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to use any level of effort (including commercially reasonable
efforts, reasonable efforts, best efforts, diligent efforts or reasonable best
efforts) to (x) obtain, or otherwise cause the issuance of, the FDA M6-C
Approval during the Earnout Period (or by any particular date), or at all, or
(y) achieve financial results or Product Revenue requiring the payment of the
First Revenue Milestone Consideration or the Second Revenue Milestone
Consideration.

 

(e)From the Effective Time until the earlier to occur of the Earnout Period
End Date or the date on which all Earnout Consideration has become due and
payable (subject to any reduction thereof as a result of the exercise of any
right of set off pursuant to Section 3.10(f)), neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall sell, assign or transfer all or substantially all
of the rights to develop or commercialize the Specified Products unless, as a
condition to such sale, assignment or transfer, the purchaser, assignee or
transferee (as applicable) assumes in writing all obligations of Parent set
forth in this Section 3.9 and Section 3.10 with respect to the Specified
Products (subject to all limitations and qualifications included in this
Agreement with respect to such obligations), including the obligation to pay,
upon the achievement of any Milestone that has not, prior to the date of such
sale, assignment or transfer, been achieved in accordance with this Section
3.9 and Section 3.10, the applicable Earnout Consideration payable with
respect to such Milestone in accordance with the terms hereof (and such
purchaser, assignee or transferee shall thereafter be deemed to be a Selling
Party for all purposes hereunder); provided that Parent shall remain liable
(subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in this Agreement)
for, and such purchaser, assignee or transferee shall not be required to
assume, any obligation to pay any Earnout Consideration payable with respect
to any Milestone achieved prior to the date of such sale, assignment or
transfer.

 

16  

Achievement of Applicable Milestones; Payment of Earnout Consideration

 

. 

 



 

(a)Within ten (10) Business Days after the achievement of the FDA Milestone,
Parent shall provide notice to the Equityholders' Representative that such FDA
Milestone has been achieved. From and after the date hereof and until
achievement of such FDA Milestone (or, if the FDA Milestone is not achieved,
until the Earnout Period End Date), (i) Parent shall provide the
Equityholders' Representative, on a semi-annual basis, a written update
covering in reasonable detail the status of activities with respect to the
issuance of the FDA M6-C Approval (each such report, an "Update Report"), and
(ii) upon reasonable request to Parent by the Equityholders' Representative
within thirty (30) days after receipt of any such Update Report, Parent shall
meet with the Equityholders' Representative at Parent's offices or via
telephone to provide verbal updates and respond to reasonable inquiries
regarding the status of (A) activities with respect to the issuance of the FDA
M6-C Approval and (B) the development, commercialization and other activities
of Parent Group Entities with respect to each Specified Product (as such
activities relate to the achievement of any Milestone that has not, as of the
date of such meeting, been achieved hereunder). 

 

(b)Beginning with the first fiscal quarter that ends on or after the last day
of the first Trailing Twelve Month Period, and ending once each of the First
Revenue Milestone and the Second Revenue Milestone have been achieved, or are
no longer capable of being achieved, no later than forty-five (45) days after
the end of each completed fiscal quarter, Parent shall provide the
Equityholders' Representative with a report (including reasonable supporting
information upon request) calculating Product Revenue with respect to the
Trailing Twelve Month Periods ending during such completed fiscal quarter. If
Parent determines that either or both of the First Revenue Milestone and the
Second Revenue Milestone has been achieved during any fiscal quarter, within
forty-five (45) days following the end of such fiscal quarter, Parent shall
provide notice to the Equityholders' Representative that the First Revenue
Milestone or the Second Revenue Milestone, as applicable, has been achieved.
Until the achievement of the Second Revenue Milestone (or, if the Second
Revenue Milestone is not achieved, until the Earnout Period End Date), and for
two (2) years thereafter, Parent shall keep (and shall cause its Affiliates,
including the Surviving Corporation, to keep) books and records pertaining to
Product Revenue with respect to applicable Trailing Twelve Month Periods, in
sufficient detail to permit the Equityholders' Representative to evaluate the
calculation of Product Revenue for purposes of determining whether the First
Revenue Milestone and the Second Revenue Milestone have been achieved. During
the period in which such books and records must be maintained, the
Equityholders' Representative may, upon written request, cause the Neutral
Auditor to audit the relevant records of Parent and its Affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation) to verify calculations of Product Revenue for
applicable Trailing Twelve Month Periods. Before beginning its audit, the
Neutral Auditor shall execute a confidentiality agreement reasonably
acceptable to Parent and its Affiliates by which the Neutral Auditor agrees to
keep confidential all information received during the audit. The Neutral
Auditor shall have the right to disclose to the Equityholders' Representative
only its conclusions regarding any payments owed under this Agreement. Parent
shall make (and shall cause its Affiliates, including the Surviving
Corporation, to make) such books and records available for inspection by the
Neutral Auditor during regular business hours at such place or places where
such records are customarily kept, upon receipt of reasonable advance notice
from the Equityholders' Representative. Such audit right shall not be
exercised more than once in any calendar year and not more frequently than
once with respect to books and records covering any specific period of time.
The Neutral Auditor shall provide its audit report and its basis for any
determination to Parent at the time such report is provided to the
Equityholders' Representative. The Equityholders' Representative (on behalf of
the Equityholders)

 

17  

will bear the full cost of such audit, unless such audit discloses that the
First Revenue Milestone or the Second Revenue Milestone was achieved but not
reported by Parent, in which case, Parent shall bear the full cost of the
Neutral Auditor for such audit. The Neutral Auditor's calculation of Product
Revenue shall be final and binding on the Parties.

 

(c)In the event that Parent determines at any time during the Earnout Period
that it is no longer possible for a particular Milestone to be achieved,
Parent shall promptly notify the Equityholders' Representative in writing of
such determination (any such notice, a "Milestone Non-Achievement Notice").
The Milestone Non-Achievement Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
rationale for such determination. Upon reasonable request to Parent by the
Equityholders' Representative within thirty (30) days after receipt of any
such Milestone Non-Achievement Notice, Parent shall make available a Parent
Representative with direct, overall responsibility for the development and
commercialization of each of the Specified Products and such other Parent
Representatives as Parent may reasonably deem appropriate at Parent's offices
or via telephone to respond to reasonable inquiries regarding such Milestone
Non-Achievement Notice.

 

(d)The Equityholders' Representative agrees to hold in strict confidence all
information received and all information learned in the course of any
procedures contemplated by clauses (a), (b) or (c) above, except to the extent
necessary to enforce its rights under this Agreement or to the extent required
to comply with any applicable Law; provided that the foregoing shall not limit
the Equityholders' Representative ability to disclose (i) to Stockholders
whether the FDA Milestone, the First Revenue Milestone, and the Second Revenue
Milestone have been achieved or whether it remains possible for any such
Milestone to be achieved, or (ii) such information on a need-to-know basis to
(A) its advisors and representatives that are subject to confidentiality
restrictions with respect to such information that are at least as restrictive
as the confidentiality restrictions applicable to the Equityholders'
Representative with respect thereto, and (B) those Equityholders that comprise
the "Advisory Committee" established under the Equityholders' Representative's
engagement letter, provided that each such Equityholder has executed a
confidentiality agreement with respect such information in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

 

(e)Within thirty (30) days after the delivery by Parent of written notice (or
in the case of the First Revenue Milestone and the Second Revenue Milestone,
delivery by the Neutral Auditor of an audit report containing a final
determination by the Neutral Auditor, if applicable) that any of the FDA
Milestone, the First Revenue Milestone or the Second Revenue Milestone has
been achieved, the applicable Earnout Consideration payable with respect
thereto (less the amount of any Company Transaction Expenses that become
payable as a result of such Earnout Consideration, which shall be paid by
Parent to the account or accounts specified in the Applicable Updated Payout
Schedule) shall be deposited by Parent with the Payments Administrator for
distribution, in accordance with the Applicable Updated Payout Schedule, to
(i) the Stockholders who have duly surrendered their Certificates and
delivered duly completed and validly executed Transmittal Letters and (ii) the
Optionholders, after giving effect to any required withholding Taxes. All
distributions made to Equityholders under this Section 3.10(e) shall be made
in accordance with the Applicable Updated Payout Schedule and their respective
Transmittal Letters and other Exchange Documents, or other appropriate
documentation, and shall be subject to Section 3.10(f) and Article 9.

 

(f)Subject to the express limitations and procedures set forth in Article 9
hereof, the obligation of Parent to pay any Earnout Consideration shall be
qualified by the right of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to reduce the
amount of any one or more of the First Revenue Milestone

 

18  

Consideration, Second Revenue Milestone Consideration or FDA Milestone
Consideration by (i) the amount of any Losses actually incurred or suffered by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation for which Parent or the Surviving
Corporation is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article 9 and (ii) the
amount that would be necessary to satisfy in full any then pending and
unsatisfied or unresolved Claims for indemnification timely asserted by Parent
or any other Parent Indemnified Person in accordance with Article 9 as if such
Claims were resolved in favor of Parent or such Parent Indemnified Person. In
the event that (A) Parent sets off the amount of any Earnout Consideration by
the amount of any Losses that have not been, at the time payment of such
Earnout Consideration is made, incurred by Parent or another Parent
Indemnified Person, and it is later finally determined that the full amount of
such Losses will not be incurred by the applicable Parent Indemnified Person,
or (B) Parent sets off the amount of any Earnout Consideration by the amount
that would be necessary to satisfy in full any pending and unsatisfied or
unresolved Claim for indemnification to which the Equityholders'
Representative objects in accordance with Section 9.6(b) (such necessary
amount, "Disputed Claim Losses"), and it is later finally determined that the
applicable Parent Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Article 9 with respect to any portion of such Disputed Claim
Losses, then, in each case of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), promptly
after such determination, the amount of the prior reduction attributable to
such Losses that will not be incurred by the applicable Parent Indemnified
Person (in the case of the foregoing clause (A)), or attributable to the
portion of such Disputed Claim Losses for which the applicable Parent
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification (in the case of the
foregoing clause (B)), shall be deposited (without interest) by Parent with
the Payments Administrator as additional Earnout Consideration for
distribution, in accordance with the Applicable Updated Payout Schedule, to
(x) the Stockholders who have duly surrendered their Certificates and
delivered duly completed and validly executed Transmittal Letters and (y) the
Optionholders, after giving effect to any required withholding Taxes. All
distributions made to Equityholders under this Section 3.10(f) shall be made
in accordance with the Applicable Updated Payout Schedule and their respective
Transmittal Letters and other Exchange Documents, or other appropriate
documentation.

 

(g)The Parties understand and agree that (i) the contingent rights to receive
any Earnout Consideration will not be represented by any form of certificate,
are not transferable, except by operation of Laws relating to descent and
distribution, divorce and community property, and do not constitute an equity
or ownership interest in Parent or the Surviving Corporation, (ii) no
Equityholder shall have any rights as a security holder of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent as a result of such Equityholder's contingent right to
receive any Earnout Consideration hereunder and (iii) no interest is payable
with respect to any Earnout Consideration.

 

(h)The Earnout Consideration provided for pursuant to this Article 3 is
provided as a result of bona fide difficulties in determining the present
value of the Company. The Earnout Consideration represents (and shall be
reported by Parent as) additional consideration for the Preferred Stock
(excluding any Redeemed Series D Shares), the Common Stock, and the Stock
Options and is not intended to be a royalty payment. Parent agrees that
Earnout Consideration paid to Stockholders will be reported by Parent as
deferred payments subject to installment sale treatment under Section 453 of
the Code (and will be reported by Parent in part as payments of interest
pursuant to Section 483 or Section 1274 of the Code).

 



 



 



 

19

Surviving Corporation's payroll system).

. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub, then the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause their respective
directors and officers to take all such lawful and necessary action, so long
as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

respects with the group health plan continuation coverage requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA ("COBRA
Coverage") and similar state laws, Section 4980D of the Code and Sections 701

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their dependents following such
current or former employee's, director's, manager's, managing director's or

and is demonstrated by signs and/or symptoms (e.g., numbness, weakness,
pathologic reflexes, mild gait disturbances, etc.) of disc herniation and/or
osteophyte formation and is confirmed by patient history and radiographic
studies. Surgery is recommended when all of the following are present:
cervical root compression visualized on MRI, concordant symptoms and signs of
cervical root-related dysfunction, pain or both; and persistence of pain
despite conservative management for at least 6 weeks. The M6-C is implanted

Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such listed Regulatory Permits are the
only permits (including licenses, registrations, certificates, orders,
clearances or approvals) issued

 

53  

under the FDandC Act and foreign equivalent Law that are required for the
Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses as
currently conducted. The Company and its Subsidiaries have been and are in
material compliance with the terms of each such Regulatory Permit. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no revocation, suspension, cancellation or material
adverse modification of any such Regulatory Permit is threatened and there is
no basis for believing that such Regulatory Permit will not be renewable upon
expiration. To the Knowledge of the Company, all material applications
required to have been filed for the renewal of the Regulatory Permits have
been duly filed with the appropriate Governmental Authority, and all other
material filings required to have been made with respect to the Regulatory

suspension of a clinical trial or clinical hold as a result of the design,
manufacture, ownership, possession, clinical development, clinical
investigation, clinical evaluation, distribution, marketing promotion, sale,
provision, implanting or other use of any Products or any services performed,
nor are there any pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
withdrawals, removals, recalls, field safety corrective actions, suspensions
of clinical trials, clinical holds or claims with respect to any Products or
any services performed for which the Company or any its Subsidiaries has or
may have a continuing Liability. No seizures have been made and no adverse
regulatory actions have been taken, and there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened seizures or regulatory actions, by the
FDA or any other Governmental Authority with respect to any of the Products,
including with respect to any facilities where any of the Products are
manufactured, processed, packaged or stored. Except as set forth in Section
4.28(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of the Company,
there are no facts that would reasonably be expected to cause the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to withdraw, remove, recall, correct or suspend any
Products from the market, to issue a field safety notice, to suspend any
clinical trial or to change the marketing classification of any Products.

Employee Benefits

(a)Parent shall give, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Affiliates to give, each current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
determined as of the Closing Date (collectively, the "Employees"), full credit
for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting under the employee
benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent or its U.S. Affiliates in
which such Employee participates following the Closing Date for such
Employee's

 

68  

service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent recognized
by comparable Employee Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date, provided
that no such credit shall result in duplication of benefits or retroactive
application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any welfare
benefit plans maintained by Parent or its U.S. Affiliates for the benefit of
Employees on and after the Closing Date, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility
requirements or pre-existing condition limitations, to the same extent waived
under comparable Employee Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to amounts paid by such Employee in the year of the Closing Date
with respect to similar Employee Plans, in each case of (i) and (ii) except to
the extent otherwise required by an insurance policy providing such welfare
benefits.

 

(b)For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (or until an
Employee's earlier termination of employment), Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates to, provide each Employee
with substantially comparable types and levels of compensation and employee
benefits, in the aggregate, as those provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent; provided that, for this purpose, the employee benefits generally
provided to Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed to be substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent, it being understood that the Employees
may commence participation in the employee benefit plans maintained by Parent
or any of its Affiliates at such times as are determined by Parent.

 

(c)At the written request of Parent provided no later than five (5) days prior
to Closing, the Company shall take all action necessary to cease contributions
to and terminate each plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Code (the
"Company 401(k) Plan"), and to adopt written resolutions, the form and
substance of which shall be subject to Parent's prior review and approval, to
terminate such Company 401(k) Plan and to one hundred percent (100%) vest all
participants under the Company 401(k) Plan, such termination and vesting to be
effective no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing; provided,
however, that such Company 401(k) Plan termination may be made contingent upon
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent
reserves the right to suspend the distribution of benefits from the Company
401(k) Plan until the later of the receipt of a favorable determination letter
from the IRS with respect to the termination of (or termination of
participation in) such plan and the completion of final testing and record
keeping for such plan. The expenses incurred in connection with the
termination of the Company 401(k) Plan shall constitute Company Transaction
Expenses for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(d)Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) constitute or be deemed to be
an amendment to any Employee Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan,
program or arrangement of the Company, Parent, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) prevent the amendment or termination of any
Employee Plan or interfere with the right or obligation of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to make such changes as are necessary to conform with
applicable Law, or (iii) otherwise operate to require Parent to duplicate any
payments or benefits payable pursuant to any Employee Plan or other
compensation or benefits plan, policy, program, agreement or other arrangement
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(e)The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 6.5 are included for the sole benefit of the Parties, and that nothing
in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third party
beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other

 

69  

Person, including any employees or former employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) to continued employment or service following the Closing
Date.

complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the

otherwise affecting such Party that relates to this Agreement or the

(c)The Company shall promptly notify Parent of (i) any Claim that is
threatened, brought, asserted or commenced against the Company or any of its

inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in Section 4.12 if such Claim
had arisen prior to the date hereof, (ii) any actual, suspected or potential
Material Compliance Violation, (iii) any Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) any
event that would have been required to be listed in Section 4.7(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or would have otherwise resulted in a breach or
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in Section 4.7(d) if such
event had occurred prior to the date hereof, in each case of the foregoing of
clauses (i) through (iv), of which the Company has Knowledge; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6(c) shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent or
any Parent Indemnified Person, including the right to or scope of
indemnification.

 

(d)In the event an actual, suspected, or potential Material Compliance
Violation occurs or is discovered prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
agree, at the request of Parent, jointly, cooperatively and transparently to
take reasonable and customary steps to investigate with Parent the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such actual, suspected, or potential Material

the exercise of any right of set off pursuant to Section 3.10(f).

 

(e)The Equityholders' Representative and Parent shall cooperate with each
other to the extent reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of
each Updated Payout Schedule by the Equityholders' Representative. The
Equityholders' Representative shall also provide Parent and the Payments
Administrator with such information as Parent and the Payments Administrator
may reasonably request to verify the calculations and other information
reflected in any Updated Payout Schedule; provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing shall not be construed to mean that any Updated Payout
Schedule is subject to Parent's or the Payment Administrator's approval (or
that the Equityholders' Representative is required to furnish a draft of any
Updated Payout Schedule to Parent or the Payment Administrator for review in
advance of delivery of such Updated Payout Schedule pursuant to Section

(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no delay by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payments Administrator in
distributing, paying, releasing or otherwise delivering any funds to any
Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a breach of this
Agreement to the extent such delay results from the failure of the
Equityholders' Representative to timely deliver an Updated Payout Schedule in
accordance with Section 6.15(d) (or from the omission of required information,
or inclusion of erroneous information, in the Payout Schedule or any Updated
Payout Schedule).

Treatment of Series D Preferred Stock, Stock Options, Warrants and Convertible
Notes.

 



 

(a)As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall provide notice of the Merger and other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to all holders of Series D Preferred Stock, Stock Options,
Warrants and Convertible Notes. The Company shall provide to Parent as
promptly as practicable copies of all notices or other correspondence to or
from holders of Series D Preferred Stock, Stock Options, Warrants or
Convertible Notes in connection with the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereunder (including any notice delivered pursuant to this
Section 6.16) and, in the case of notices or other correspondence to holders
of Series D Preferred Stock, Stock Options, Warrants or Convertible Notes,
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
all such documentation prior to its dissemination to holders of Series D
Preferred Stock, Stock Options, Warrants or Convertible Notes. 

 

(b)Any exercise of Stock Options between the date hereof and immediately prior

and effectiveness of the Merger at the Effective Time.

 

Section 6.17Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

 

(a)For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, subject to
Section 6.17(b), the Surviving Corporation agrees to honor provisions
regarding indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, Covered Persons
that are no less favorable to the Covered Persons than the provisions
contained (i) in the Charter and Bylaws or in the equivalent organizational
documents of each Subsidiary of the Company listed on Section 4.1(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, in each case as in effect on the
date hereof, and (ii) in any indemnification agreement between such Covered
Person and the Company (or any Subsidiary thereof) that is listed in Section
6.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and has been made available to Parent
prior to the date hereof, as in effect on the date hereof (without giving
effect to any amendments or modifications thereto, unless such amendments or
modifications are specifically referenced in Section 6.17 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and were made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof). For purposes of this Section 6.17, "Covered Person" shall mean any
person who is serving (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) or has
previously served as a director, manager, managing director or officer of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company listed on Section 4.1(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b)At or before the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase for the benefit
of the Covered Persons a directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance "tail" or "run-off" policy of at least the same
coverage and amounts as, and containing terms and conditions that are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured than, the Company's current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance, with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time and which covers a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time. 

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes of
the calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration, the aggregate amount of
the premium paid to purchase the above-referenced "tail" or "run-off" policy
shall be the responsibility of the Company (and treated as a Company
Transaction Expense hereunder). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing

 

76  

contained in this Section 6.17 shall operate to release or otherwise limit any
obligations of the Equityholders arising under this Agreement, including the
indemnification obligations in Article 9.

 

280G Approval.

 

 If required to avoid the imposition of Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code
or the loss of deduction under Section 280G of the Code with respect to any
payment or benefit in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, in a
manner that complies with Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder ("Section 280G"), the Company shall seek
approval by its stockholders, to the extent entitled to vote under Section
280G, of the right of any "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G) to receive or retain any and all payments that might otherwise
constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G. Prior to
seeking such approval, the Company shall obtain waivers from each disqualified
individual such that, unless such payments are approved by the Company's
stockholders, to the extent required by and in the manner that complies with
Section 280G, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make such
payments and the disqualified individual shall have no right or entitlement
with respect thereto. The form and substance of (a) all stockholder approval
documents contemplated by this Section 6.18, including any disclosure
statement or written consent, (b) waivers contemplated by this Section 6.18,
and (c) any mathematical analysis of the Section 280G payments, in each case
shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent. The Company
shall provide such documentation and information to Parent for its review and
approval (provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld by
Parent) prior to soliciting waivers from the disqualified individuals, and the
Company shall implement all reasonable and timely comments from Parent
thereon. No payment of any such waived payment shall be made unless (i) such
requisite Section 280G approval has been obtained and (ii) prior to payment,
the Company has delivered to Parent evidence of such approval.

 

Cayman Subsidiary.

 



 

(a)As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than fifteen
(15) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date), the Company shall cause the
Cayman Subsidiary to file with the IRS a valid election on Form 8832 to be
classified as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (such
election on Form 8832, the "Cayman Subsidiary Tax Election"), with such
election to be effective on or before the date of such filing; provided that
such filing shall be subject to prior review and approval by Parent.

 

(b)From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Intellectual

by or licensed to the Cayman Subsidiary) to be validly and effectively
transferred to the Company, so that, as of the Effective Time, (x) all such
Intellectual Property shall be owned by (or, in the case of Intellectual
Property that the Cayman Subsidiary currently licenses from a Person that is
not an Affiliate of the Cayman Subsidiary, otherwise held by) the Company and
(y) the Cayman Subsidiary shall have ceased to hold any rights therein;

expected to give rise (before or after the Effective Time) to any material
Liability of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their

 

77  

respective Affiliates, (C) would not reasonably be expected to impair (before
or after the Effective Time), in any material respect, such Intellectual
Property (or the value thereof to, or use thereof by, the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates) or the business,
operations or assets of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Affiliates, and (D) is otherwise reasonably satisfactory
to Parent;

 

(ii)all Contracts and other instruments governing, effecting or memorializing
such transfers (and all filings with, or notices or other submissions to, any
Governmental Authority or other third party with respect to such transfers)
shall be subject to prior review and approval by Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); and

 

(iii)no such transfer shall be effected, and no Contract or other instrument
governing, effecting or memorializing any such transfer shall be executed or
otherwise entered into (and no filing shall be made with, and no notice or
other submission shall be provided to, any Governmental Authority or other
third party with respect to any such transfer), before the Cayman Subsidiary
Tax Election has been filed with the IRS and become effective.

 

Further Assurances.

 

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall (at
its own cost and expense, subject, in the case of the Equityholders'

9.5(d) and paragraph (c) of Exhibit M) at any time and from time to time, upon
reasonable request, (a) do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, and cause to be
done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, all such further acts, transfers

apply to the Equityholders' Representative), and (b) take such other actions
as may be reasonably required in order to carry out the intent of this
Agreement; provided that in no event shall any Party be required to take any
action which (i) increases in any way the Liabilities or obligations of such
Party, (ii) in the opinion of its counsel, is unlawful or would or could
constitute a violation of any applicable Law or require the approval of any

Effect of Termination; Termination Fee

 

.

 

(a)In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1
(which termination will be effective immediately upon the delivery of written
notice of the terminating Party to the other Parties), this Agreement (other
than this Section 8.2, Sections 6.3(c), 6.8 and 11.1 through 11.12, and
paragraph (c) of Exhibit M, and any related definitions, which shall survive
such termination) will forthwith become void and be of no further force and
effect, and there will be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company or any of their respective

 

84  

officers or directors to the other and all rights and obligations of any Party
hereto will cease, except that nothing herein will relieve any Party from
liability for any breach, prior to termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement.

 

(b)In the event of a termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee equal to
Parent's documented out of pocket charges and expenses (including attorneys'
fees) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, within
seven (7) Business Days after such termination, and, if the Company enters
into a definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal within twelve
(12) months of such termination, then the Company shall pay Parent an
additional termination fee of One Million Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,050,000)
(such additional termination fee to be paid prior to the time of execution of
such definitive agreement).

 

(c)In the event of a termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(d), if, within twelve (12) months following such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal
providing for consideration to the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock
of greater economic value, taken as a whole, than that which would have been
provided pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
then the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of Two Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000), such fee to be paid prior to the time
of execution of such definitive agreement.

 

(d)All payments under this Section 8.2 shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

 

(e)The Parties acknowledge that (i) the fees and the other provisions of this
Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) the fees payable pursuant to this Section 8.2 are not a
penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent and Merger Sub for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(iii) without the agreements set forth in this Section 8.2, Parent and Merger
Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to
pay any fee specified in Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.1(c) when due, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Claim that results in a
judgment against the Company for such fee, the Company shall pay to Parent,
together with such fee, (A) interest on such fee from the date such fee was
due hereunder at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate and (B) Parent's
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with
such Claim.

 

Amendment

 

. This Agreement may be amended to the fullest extent permitted by Law by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company by action taken by or on behalf of their
respective Board of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after approval of this Agreement by their respective stockholders,
but after any such stockholder approval (including the Stockholder Approval),
no amendment shall be made which by Law requires the further approval of
stockholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may be
amended to the fullest extent permitted by Law by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Equityholders' Representative at any time after the
Effective Time, but no amendment shall be made which by Law requires the
further approval of the Stockholders without obtaining such further approval.

Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Equityholders' Representative.

hand, and the Company, on the other, may, to the extent permitted by Law,
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
required by the other Party hereunder, waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such Party and contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby. The waiver of any
condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, or the waiver of
the fulfillment of any such condition, shall not affect the right to
indemnification under Article 9 or other remedy based on such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation.

(ii)for the avoidance of doubt (and without limiting Section 9.2(c)(i)(A) or
the right of any Parent Indemnified Person to recover from the Escrow Fund or
by offset against Earnout Consideration), no amounts payable to Parent
Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall be recoverable directly
from any Equityholder other than the Consenting Equityholders;

Person to recover from the Escrow Fund or by offset against Earnout
Consideration.

(including the word "material"), Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualifiers.

 

(b)The Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to any breach, untruth

Losses until the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the Parent
Indemnified Persons with respect thereto exceeds Four Hundred Fifty Thousand

Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to indemnification for all Losses
incurred by such Parent Indemnified Persons in excess of the Threshold Amount,

Claim is among a series of Claims that arise from the same or substantially
similar facts or circumstances, with respect to such series of Claims) exceeds
Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) (the "Individual Claim Threshold"), in
which case the Parent Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to indemnification
for all Losses incurred by such Parent Indemnified Persons with respect to
such Claim regardless of the Individual Claim Threshold.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of
calculating or determining the amount of Losses indemnifiable under Section
9.2(a), (i) no Parent Indemnified Person shall be entitled to double recovery
under this Agreement for any such indemnifiable Losses, even though such
Losses may have resulted from the breach of more than one of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement, or
been indemnifiable under more than one subsection of Section 9.2(a), and (ii)
if and solely to the extent that such indemnifiable Losses were taken into
account in the calculation of the Final Working Capital, Final Debt Pay-Off
Amount or Final Company Transaction Expenses, the same amount of such Losses
may not be recovered under Section 9.2(a).

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Parent Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to make any claim for Losses pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to Taxes allocable to any Tax period (or portion of a
Tax period) occurring subsequent to the date of the

 

91  

Effective Time to the extent related to or arising from (i) the amount, value
or condition of any Tax asset or attribute (e.g. net operating loss
carryforward or Tax credit carryforward) of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, or (ii) the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates to utilize such Tax asset or attribute in any Tax period
or portion thereof beginning on or after the Closing Date.

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the amount of
any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article 9 shall be
reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds actually recovered by the
applicable Parent Indemnified Person with respect to such Losses (net of
actual out-of-pocket and reasonable costs of enforcement, deductibles, premium
increases and retro-premium adjustments related to such Losses), and Parent
and the applicable Parent Indemnified Person shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to realize such proceeds; provided, that the
foregoing shall not require any Parent Indemnified Person to file suit or
initiate litigation, mediation or other proceedings against any Person.

 

Escrow Fund

thereon) to constitute the Escrow Fund and to be governed by the terms set
forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b)Within three (3) Business Days following the date that is twenty-four (24)
months after the Closing Date, Parent and the Equityholders' Representative
shall, by delivery of a joint release certificate to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to

Applicable Updated Payout Schedule, to (i) the Stockholders who have duly

less amounts that would be necessary to satisfy fully any then pending and
unsatisfied or unresolved Claims for indemnification timely asserted by any
Parent Indemnified Person in accordance with this Article 9 and the Escrow
Agreement as if such Claims were resolved in favor of Parent or such other
Parent Indemnified Person. Amounts not distributed under the foregoing in
respect of pending and unsatisfied or unresolved Claims shall remain in the
Escrow Fund until the related Claims have been resolved or until any such
portion of such amounts is determined pursuant to Section 9.6 to be no longer
necessary to satisfy such Claims. As soon as all such Claims have been
resolved or any such portion of such amounts is determined pursuant to Section
9.6 to be no longer necessary to satisfy such Claims, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver to the Payments Administrator (for distribution, in accordance with
the Applicable Updated Payout Schedule, to (A) the Stockholders who have duly
surrendered their Certificates and delivered duly completed and validly
executed Transmittal Letters and (B) the Optionholders, after giving effect to
any required withholding Taxes) the remaining portion of such undistributed
amount, if any, not required to satisfy such Claims. All payments made to

respective Transmittal Letters and other Exchange Documents, or other
appropriate documentation.

93  

Equityholder shall be deemed to have irrevocably transferred and assigned to
the Equityholders' Representative any ownership right that such Equityholder
otherwise may now have or may in the future have in any such interest,
dividends, earnings or other income). The Equityholders' Representative shall
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Amount other than as a
result of its gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. The
Equityholders' Representative shall hold the Expense Amount (or any remaining
portion thereof) separate from its corporate funds, shall not use the Expense
Amount (or any remaining portion thereof) for its operating expenses or any
other corporate purposes and shall not voluntarily make the Expense Amount (or
any remaining portion thereof) available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion of the
Equityholders' Representative's responsibilities, the Equityholders'
Representative shall deliver any remaining balance of the Expense Fund to the
Payments Administrator (for distribution, in accordance with the Applicable
Updated Payout Schedule, to (i) the Stockholders who have duly surrendered
their Certificates and delivered duly completed and validly executed
Transmittal Letters and (ii) the Optionholders, after giving effect to any
required withholding Taxes). The Parties agree that amounts distributed to
Stockholders from the Expense Fund will be treated for tax purposes as
deferred payments of purchase price, except to the extent treated as payments
of interest pursuant to Section 483 or Section 1274 of the Code.

 

Indemnification Claims

 

.

 

(a)In the event a Claim is made by a Parent Indemnified Person entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Person"), such
Indemnified Person (or a representative thereof) must give written notice (the
"Claim Notice") of such Claim to the Indemnifying Person. The Claim Notice
shall (i) state that an indemnification Claim (or indemnification Claims)
pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or any other provision of this Agreement is being
made, (ii) describe the basis for such Claim with reasonable specificity and
(iii) set forth in reasonable detail the Losses (or reasonably anticipated
Losses) in respect of such Claim (provided that the Indemnified Person shall
not be bound by any estimate of Losses contained in such Claim Notice);
provided that the Claim Notice need only specify such information to the
knowledge of such Indemnified Person (or such representative thereof) as of
the date thereof, shall not limit any of the rights or remedies of any
Indemnified Person, and may be updated and amended from time to time by the
Indemnified Person by delivering an updated or amended Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Person; provided further, no Indemnified Person's rights or
remedies shall be prejudiced as a result of limitations on disclosure in such
Claim Notice, where such limitations are made in good faith to preserve the
attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine, or any other privileges.
The Claim Notice shall be provided to the Indemnifying Person as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Indemnified Person becomes aware that it has
incurred or suffered a Loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to
Section 9.1, any failure to provide the Indemnifying Person with a Claim
Notice, or any failure to provide a Claim Notice in a timely manner as
aforesaid (or to include in such Claim Notice the information required above),
shall not relieve any Indemnifying Person from any liability that it may have
to the Indemnified Person under this Section 9.6 except to the extent, if at
all, that the ability of such Indemnifying Person to defend such Claim is
materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Person's failure to give such Claim
Notice. If the Claim Notice relates to a Third Party Claim, the procedures
set forth in Section 9.7 will be applicable.

 

(b)If the Claim Notice does not relate to a Third Party Claim, within thirty
(30) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Indemnifying Person shall
provide a written notice to Parent, indicating whether the Indemnifying Person
objects to the indemnification Claim and describing the basis for any
objection with reasonable specificity. If no such objection notice is

 

94  

received by Parent within such thirty (30) Business Day period, the
Indemnifying Person shall be deemed to be entirely liable for indemnification
of the indemnification Claim pursuant to this Agreement (subject to the
limitations set forth in Sections 9.2(d) and 9.2(e)). If such notice of
objection is provided within such period, the Indemnifying Person and the
Indemnified Person or its representative(s) shall then attempt in good faith
for twenty-five (25) Business Days to agree upon a resolution of such
indemnification Claim. If no such resolution can be reached after good faith
negotiation during such twenty-five (25) Business Day period, unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person,
the Indemnified Person may institute proceedings in a court of competent
jurisdiction (in accordance with Section 11.8) to resolve any such dispute,
and the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall seek to resolve
such dispute in as expeditious a manner as practicable. In the case of any
such proceeding, the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall each
be responsible for the payment of its own fees and expenses.

 

Third Party Claims

 

. The following additional provisions shall apply with respect to any Claims
or demands by third parties as to which any Indemnified Person seeks
indemnification hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"). 

 

(a)Unless such Indemnified Person affirmatively elects not to control the
defense of such Third Party Claim by delivering a written notice (such notice,
a "Non-Defense Election") to the Indemnifying Person within thirty (30)
Business Days after giving the Indemnifying Person the applicable Claim Notice
in respect of such Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Person shall defend,
contest, negotiate or settle each such Third Party Claim through counsel of
its own selection (who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying
Person), at the expense and for the account of the Indemnifying Person (and
the Indemnifying Person shall cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance
to any such Indemnified Person in the defense of such Claim or demand);
provided, however, that

 

(i)the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to receive copies of such
pleadings, notices and communications with respect to any Third Party Claim as
the Indemnifying Person may reasonably request and participate in such
defense, at its own expense, with counsel of its choosing, and such
Indemnified Person and its counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Person in doing so, and

 

(ii)such Indemnified Person will not settle, compromise, or offer to settle or
compromise any such Third Party Claim unless (A) the Indemnifying Person
provides prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, or (B) no indemnification under this Article
9 is sought by any Indemnified Person in connection with the Third Party Claim
covered by the settlement.

 

(b)If, within thirty (30) Business Days after the Indemnified Person (or its
representative) gives the Indemnifying Person the applicable Claim Notice in
respect of such Third Party Claim, both (i) the Indemnifying Person delivers a
written notice to the Indemnified Person stating that, subject to delivery of
a Non-Defense Election by the Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying Person
elects to control the defense of such Third Party Claim, and (ii) the
Indemnified Person delivers a Non-Defense Election to the Indemnifying Person,
then, subject to Section 9.7(d), the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to
defend, contest, negotiate or settle such Third Party Claim, at the expense
and for the account of the Indemnifying Person, through counsel of its own
selection (who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Person).

 

95  

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.7, in the event
and for so long as a Third Party Claim (i) relates solely to the payment of
monetary damages in an aggregate amount that does not exceed the amount then
available under the Escrow Fund (excluding amounts in the Escrow Fund that are
otherwise the subject of pending indemnification claims under this Article 9),
which amount must remain in escrow pending final resolution of such Third
Party Claim, (ii) does not relate to criminal conduct or the payment of Taxes,
(iii) was not instituted by a Governmental Authority, and (iv) does not seek
equitable, injunctive or other non-monetary relief, subject to Section 9.7(d),
the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to defend, contest, negotiate or
settle such Third Party Claim, at the expense and for the account of the
Indemnifying Person, through counsel of its own selection (who shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Person), if the Indemnifying Person
provides written notice of its election to assume such defense pursuant to
this Section 9.7(c) within thirty (30) Business Days after the Indemnified
Person first delivers the applicable Claim Notice in respect of such Third
Party Claim to the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnifying Person
acknowledges in such written notice that any Losses that may be asserted
against the Indemnified Person in such Third Party Claim constitute Losses for
which the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article 9. 

 

(d)In the event that the Indemnifying Person has assumed the defense of any
Third Party Claim pursuant to either Section 9.7(b) or (c), in each case all
of the following shall apply:

 

(i)The Indemnified Person shall cooperate with and provide reasonable
assistance to the Indemnifying Person in the defense of such Third Party
Claim;

 

(ii)the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices and communications with respect to such Third Party Claim
as the Indemnified Person may reasonably request and participate in such
defense, at its own expense, with counsel of its choosing, and such
Indemnifying Person and its counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnified
Person in doing so;

 

(iii)the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to immediately assume control of
the defense, contest, negotiation and settlement of such Third Party Claim in
the event any of the conditions in clauses (i) through (iv) of Section 9.7(c)
are not satisfied with respect to such Third Party Claim, or if the
Indemnifying Person fails to diligently defend such Third Party Claim, in
which case such costs and expenses associated with such defense by the
Indemnified Person may be sought in a claim for indemnification hereunder; and

 

(iv)the Indemnifying Person shall not be entitled to settle, compromise, or
offer to settle or compromise such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Person, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed so long as (A) the conditions in clauses (i)
through (iv) of Section 9.7(c) are satisfied with respect to such Third Party
Claim, (B) such settlement or compromise includes only the payment of monetary
damages (which are fully paid at the time of such settlement or compromise by
the Indemnifying Person), and (C) such settlement or compromise releases the
Indemnified Person completely in connection with such Third Party Claim, with
no statement as to or an admission of fault by or on behalf of the Indemnified
Person or any of its Affiliates and no monetary or nonmonetary relief granted
by or imposed upon the Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates. The
Indemnifying Person shall notify the Indemnified Person in writing prior to
effecting any settlement or compromise

 

96  

pursuant to this Section 9.7(d)(iv) and shall make available a copy of the
settlement agreement for the Indemnified Person's review prior to execution
thereof. 

 

Payment

 

. Upon a determination of liability under this Article 9, (a) with respect to
any amounts payable to a Parent Indemnified Person that are to be recovered
from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 9.2(c), Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative shall promptly deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release such funds to Parent from the
Escrow Fund, and (b) with respect to any amounts payable to an Indemnified
Person that are to be recovered directly from the Indemnifying Person pursuant
to Section 9.2(c)(i)(B), the Indemnifying Person shall pay or cause to be paid
to the Indemnified Person the amount so determined within ten (10) Business
Days after the date of such determination. If there should be a dispute as to
the amount or manner of determination of any indemnity obligation owed under
this Agreement, any portion of such amount that is not subject to dispute
shall nevertheless be paid as set forth above.

 

Remedy

 

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the existence of this
Article 9 and of the rights, limitations and restrictions set forth herein do
not limit any legal or other remedy with respect to Claims based on fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct.

 

Article 10 
TAX

 



 

Tax Allocation.

 

 In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that
begins before the date of the Effective Time and ends after the date of the
Effective Time, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion
of the period ending on the date of the Effective Time shall be:

 

(a)in the case of Taxes that are either (i) based upon or related to income,
receipts, payroll or other compensation for services or (ii) imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible), deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the taxable year ended at the end of the date of the Effective Time
(except that, solely for purposes of determining the marginal tax rate
applicable to income or receipts during such period in a jurisdiction in which
such tax rate depends upon the level of income or receipts, annualized income
or receipts may be taken into account if appropriate for an equitable sharing
of such Taxes); and

 

(b)in the case of Taxes not described in Section 10.1(a) that are imposed on a
periodic basis and measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount
of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined
on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the period ending on the date of the Effective Time and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

 

Section 10.2Returns and Payments. 

 

(a)The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, prepare and file in
a timely manner all Tax Returns relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that are due on or before the date of the Effective Time. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, pay in

 

97  

a timely manner all Taxes that are due on or before the date of the Effective
Time. Such Tax Returns shall be true, correct and complete and, except as
otherwise required by a change in applicable Law, (i) shall be prepared, and
each item thereon treated, in a manner consistent with past practices employed
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) shall utilize
accounting methods, elections and conventions that do not have the effect of
distorting the allocation of income or expense between the Tax periods covered
by such Tax Returns and subsequent Tax periods. Parent shall have the right
to review such Tax Returns for thirty (30) days prior to the filing of such
Tax Returns that are income Tax Returns and a reasonable period prior to the
filing of such Tax Returns that are not income Tax Returns, and the Company
agrees to discuss with Parent in good faith the items reflected on such Tax
Returns and any adjustments reasonably requested by Parent.

 

(b)The Surviving Corporation shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
and filed, in a timely manner all Tax Returns relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are due after the date of the Effective Time with respect to
Tax periods ending on or before the date of the Effective Time and Straddle
Periods. Except as otherwise required by a change of applicable Law, (i) such
Tax Returns shall be prepared, and each item thereon treated, in a manner
consistent with past practices employed with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (except to the extent counsel for the Surviving Corporation
determines there is no reasonable basis in Law therefor or determines that a
Tax Return cannot be so prepared and filed or an item so reported without
being subject to penalties) and (ii) shall utilize accounting methods,
elections and conventions that do not have the effect of distorting the
allocation of income or expense between the Tax periods covered by such Tax
Returns and subsequent Tax periods. The Equityholders' Representative shall
have the right to review such Tax Returns for thirty (30) days prior to the
filing of such Tax Returns that are income Tax Returns and a reasonable period
prior to the filing of such Tax Returns that are not income Tax Returns, and
the Surviving Corporation shall discuss in good faith the items reflected on
such Tax Returns and any adjustments reasonably requested by the
Equityholders' Representative. The Surviving Corporation shall be reimbursed
promptly out of amounts on deposit in the Escrow Fund for (A) Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Returns that relate to Tax periods that end on or before
the date of the Effective Time, and (B) Taxes due with respect to Tax Returns
that relate to Tax periods that end after the date of the Effective Time to
the extent that such Taxes are allocable (pursuant to the provisions of
Section 10.1) to the portion of such Tax periods ending on the date of the
Effective Time; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
reimbursed for such a Tax to the extent that such Tax has been taken into
account as a reduction in Working Capital for purposes of Section 3.8.

 

(c)For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have
the sole right to prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax
Returns relating to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries with
respect to Tax periods beginning on or after the date of the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent or any of its Affiliates shall
(i) amend any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any Tax periods ending on or before the date of the Effective Time
or enter into any voluntary disclosure agreement, engage in any voluntary
compliance procedures or make any other similar voluntary contact with any
Governmental Authority with respect to any Tax Return of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for such Tax periods, (ii) consent to the extension or waiver
of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Tax periods ending
on or before the date of the Effective Time, or (iii) make any Tax election
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has effect for any
Tax periods ending on or before the date of the Effective Time, in each case
without the prior written consent of the Equityholders' Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

98  

Section 10.3Contests.

 

(a)After the date of the Effective Time, Parent shall promptly notify the
Equityholders' Representative in writing of any written notice of a proposed
adjustment or Claim in an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
involving Parent or the Company or its Subsidiaries which, if determined
adversely to the taxpayer, would be grounds for indemnification under Article
9; provided, however, that a failure to give such notice will not affect
Parent's right to indemnification thereunder except to the extent, if any,
that, but for such failure, the Equityholders would have avoided the Tax
Liability in question.

 

(b)The procedures set forth in Section 9.7 shall control in the case of Third
Party Claims relating to Taxes or an audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding that relates solely to taxable periods ending on or before the date
of the Effective Time.

 

Cooperation and Exchange of Information.

 

 The Equityholders' Representative, the Company and Parent will each provide
the others with such cooperation and information as any of them reasonably may
request of the others in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim
for refund, determining a Liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes,
participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes or making representations to or furnishing information to parties
subsequently desiring to acquire either of the Surviving Corporation or a part
of the business acquired from the Company by Parent. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions
thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax authorities. The
Equityholders' Representative and Parent shall (and Parent after the Effective
Time will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, if any, to)
retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents
in their possession relating to Tax matters of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, if any, for the taxable period that includes the date of the
Effective Time and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (a) the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such
Tax Returns and other documents relate, or (b) six (6) years following the due
date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. Any information obtained under
this Section 10.4 shall be kept confidential except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or
in conducting an audit or other proceeding; provided, however, the foregoing
shall not prohibit the Equityholders' Representative from disclosing such
information on a need-to-know basis to (i) its advisors and representatives
that are subject to confidentiality restrictions with respect to such
information that are at least as restrictive as the confidentiality
restrictions applicable to the Equityholders' Representative with respect
thereto, and (ii) those Equityholders that comprise the "Advisory Committee"
established under the Equityholders' Representative's engagement letter,
provided that each such Equityholder has executed a confidentiality agreement
with respect such information in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent.

 

Characterization of Payments.

 

 Parent and the Equityholders agree to treat all payments made by any of them
to or for the benefit of the others (including any payments to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) under Article 9 or other indemnity provisions of this
Agreement and for any misrepresentations or breach of warranties or covenants
as adjustments to the purchase price or as capital contributions for Tax
purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to
the extent that the Laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise, in
which case such payments shall be made in an amount sufficient to indemnify
the relevant party on an after-Tax basis. 

 

99  

Transfer Taxes.

 

 All transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and any other such Taxes
and related fees (including any penalties, interest and additions to Tax)
("Transfer Taxes") arising out of or incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be borne one-half by Parent and one-half by the Equityholders.
The Person that is legally required to file a Tax Return relating to Transfer
Taxes shall be responsible for preparing and timely filing such Tax Return and
Parent and the Equityholders shall each be responsible for reimbursing the
other for any portion of such Transfer Taxes that the other has paid in excess
of its 50% share (as determined pursuant to the foregoing sentence) within ten
(10) days after receiving notice that the other has paid such Transfer Taxes
(provided that, if Parent has paid more than its 50% share of any Transfer
Taxes, Parent shall be reimbursed for the Equityholders' portion of such
Transfer Taxes promptly out of amounts on deposit in the Escrow Fund). The
Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other to minimize any liability
relating to Transfer Taxes, including in preparing any filings or elections
with any Governmental Authority, as applicable.

 

Tax Records.

 

 Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent (a) a
notice setting forth the name and contact information of each third party
provider of tax services that has been engaged by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time within the four (4) years preceding the Closing Date,
and (b) copies of all books and records of, and all other documents and
materials in the possession or control of, the Company and its Subsidiaries
that contain information required for the preparation of any Tax Returns
(other than Tax Returns that have been filed prior to the Effective Time)
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to (i) Tax periods
ending on or before the date of the Effective Time or (ii) Straddle Periods.

Severability.

 

 If any term or other provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, is invalid, illegal, void or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law, or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal, void or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good

 

101  

faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Entire Agreement.

 

 This Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (including all exhibits, annexes and
schedules hereto and thereto), the Equityholders' Representative's engagement
letter and the other documents and instruments delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto constitute the entire agreement among, and supersede all prior
representations, agreements, understandings and undertakings (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement), both written and oral, among, the Parties (or any
of them) with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and no Party is
relying on any prior oral or written representations, agreements,
understandings or undertakings (other than the Confidentiality Agreement) with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

Assignment.

 

 This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise,
except that (a) Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights
hereunder to any Affiliate (provided that no such assignment shall relieve the
assigning Party of its obligations hereunder), and (b) without limiting
Section 3.9(e), from and after the Effective Time, Parent may assign all of
its rights and obligations hereunder to a Person that directly or indirectly
acquires all of the capital stock, substantially all of the assets, or all or
part of the business, of the Surviving Corporation, so long as such Person
assumes this Agreement, in writing, and agrees to be bound by and to comply
with all of the terms and conditions hereof. 

 

Parties in Interest.

 

 Subject to Section 11.5 hereof, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of the Equityholders and each Party and each of
their respective permitted successors and assigns, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person (other than the Indemnified Persons, who shall be third party
beneficiaries hereof to the extent set forth in Article 9) any right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.

 

 No failure or delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right
hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

 

Section 11.8Governing Law; Jurisdiction. 

 

(a)This Agreement and all disputes, controversies, or claims relating to,
arising out of or under, or in connection with this Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including the negotiation or execution
hereof and performance hereunder, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of choice of law or
conflicts of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction). Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
submits to the sole and exclusive personal jurisdiction of (i) the state
courts of the State of Delaware, and (ii) the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware (and appropriate appellate courts therefrom), for the
purposes of any dispute, claim, controversy, suit, action, or other proceeding
relating to, arising out of or under, or in connection with this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each
of the Parties

 

102  

further agrees and covenants (A) to commence any such action, suit or
proceeding either in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware or, if such suit, action or other proceeding may not be brought in
such court for jurisdictional reasons, in any state court located in the State
of Delaware and (B) to not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court.
Notwithstanding clause (A) of the foregoing sentence, each of the Parties
further agrees and covenants that if subject matter jurisdiction over any
action, suit, or proceeding in connection with any dispute, Claim, or
controversy relating to, arising out of or under, or in connection with this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby exists in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by reason of
Section 111 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or if there otherwise
exists a good faith basis for concluding that the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware would have subject matter jurisdiction in connection with

M-1

Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

 

(ii)engage counsel, and such accountants and other advisors on behalf and for
the benefit of the Equityholders and incur such other expenses on behalf of
any of the Equityholders in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby as the
Equityholders' Representative may in its sole discretion deem necessary,
appropriate and advisable;

 

(iii)take such other action as the Equityholders' Representative or any of the
Equityholders is authorized to take under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement;

 

(iv)receive all documents or certificates and make all determinations, on
behalf of any of the Equityholders, required or permitted under this Agreement

(vi)take all such action as may be necessary to carry out any of the

(vii)take all such action as the Equityholders' Representative may in its sole
discretion deem necessary or appropriate in connection with any waiver of any
obligation of Parent or the Surviving Corporation;

 

(viii)take all such action as the Equityholders' Representative may in its
sole discretion deem necessary or appropriate in respect of any post-Closing
adjustment of the Working Capital, Debt Pay-Off Amount, Company Transaction
Expenses or Cash pursuant to Section 3.8; and

 

(ix)take all such action as the Equityholders' Representative may in its sole
discretion deem necessary or appropriate in respect of any Claims for which
indemnification is sought pursuant to Article 9 (including contesting,
disputing or settling any such Claims, or defending (or participating in the
defense of) any Third Party Claims).

 

All actions, decisions and instructions of the Equityholders' Representative
that are within the scope of the authority of the Equityholders'
Representative, as set forth in Section 9.5 and this Exhibit M, shall be
conclusive and binding upon all of the Equityholders.

 

(c)Exculpation and Indemnification of Equityholders' Representative. The
Equityholders' Representative will incur no liability of any kind to any
Equityholder with respect to any action or omission by the Equityholders'
Representative in connection with the Equityholders' Representative's services
pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto (including the
Escrow Agreement), except in the event of liability directly resulting from
the Equityholders' Representative's fraud or willful misconduct. The
Equityholders' Representative shall not be liable to any Equityholder for any
action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Equityholders shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Equityholders' Representative from and
against any

 

M-2  

and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel
and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication
and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in
connection with the Equityholders' Representative's execution and performance
of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided that in the event that
any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the fraud or willful misconduct of the Equityholders'
Representative, the Equityholders' Representative will reimburse the
Equityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent
attributable to such fraud or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Equityholders' Representative by the Equityholders, any such Representative
Losses may be recovered by the Equityholders' Representative from the funds in
the Expense Fund; provided that while this section allows the Equityholders'
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned source of funds, this does
not relieve the Equityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Equityholders' Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at
law or otherwise. In no event will the Equityholders' Representative be
required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Equityholders or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of the
Equityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provided to the Equityholders' Representative in
this paragraph. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Equityholders' Representative or the termination
of this Agreement.

 

(d)Reasonable Reliance. In the performance of its, his or her duties
hereunder, the Equityholders' Representative shall be entitled to rely upon
any document or instrument reasonably believed by the Equityholders'
Representative to be genuine, accurate as to content and signed by any
Equityholder or by Parent or the Escrow Agent. The Equityholders'
Representative may assume that any Person purporting to give any notice in
accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so.

 

(e)Attorney-in-Fact. 

 

(i)The Equityholders' Representative is hereby appointed and constituted the
true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent of each Equityholder, with full
power in his, her or its name and on his, her or its behalf to act on his, her
or its behalf in connection with this Agreement and the agreements ancillary
hereto (including the Escrow Agreement) in the absolute discretion of the
Equityholders' Representative, and in general to do all things and to perform
all acts including executing and delivering the Escrow Agreement and any other
agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, notices or instruments
contemplated by or deemed advisable in connection with this Agreement and the
agreements ancillary hereto (including the Escrow Agreement).

 

(ii)This power of attorney and all authority hereby conferred is granted and
shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any
Equityholder or by operation of Law, whether by such Equityholder's death,
disability, protective supervision or any other event. Without limitation to
the foregoing, this power of attorney is to ensure the performance of a
special obligation and, accordingly, each Equityholder hereby renounces its,
his or her right to renounce this power of attorney unilaterally.

 

(iii)Each Equityholder hereby waives any and all defenses which may be
available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Equityholders'
Representative taken in good

 

M-3  

faith under this Agreement or any agreement ancillary hereto (including the
Escrow Agreement) pursuant to the authority granted in this Exhibit M.

 

(iv)Notwithstanding the power of attorney granted in this Exhibit M, no
agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or document shall be
ineffective by reason only of the Equityholders constituting a Majority in
Interest having signed or given such directly instead of the Equityholders'
Representative. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Majority in
Interest" shall mean Equityholders representing a majority in interest of the
consideration payable under this Agreement.

 

(f)Removal of Equityholders' Representative; Authority of Successor
Equityholders' Representative. Equityholders who in the aggregate constitute
at least a Majority in Interest shall have the right, upon not less than ten
(10) days' written notice, at any time during the period prior to the
Escrow/Set-Off Remedy End Date to remove the then acting Equityholders'
Representative and to appoint a successor Equityholders' Representative;
provided, however, that neither such removal of the then acting Equityholders'
Representative nor such appointment of a successor Equityholders'
Representative shall be effective until the delivery to the Escrow Agent (so
long as the Escrow Fund remains) of executed counterparts of a writing signed
by each such Equityholder constituting a Majority in Interest with respect to
such removal and appointment, together with an acknowledgment signed by the
successor Equityholders' Representative appointed in such writing that he or
she accepts the responsibility of successor Equityholders' Representative and
agrees to perform and be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement
applicable to the Equityholders' Representative. Each successor
Equityholders' Representative shall have all of the power, authority, rights
and privileges conferred by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement upon the
original Equityholders' Representative, and the term "Equityholders'
Representative" as used herein and in the Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to
include any interim or successor Equityholders' Representative.

 

(g)Resignation of Equityholders' Representative. The Person acting as
Equityholders' Representative may resign at any time upon no less than twenty
(20) days' notice to (i) Parent in accordance with Section 11.2 hereof, (ii)
the Equityholders at their respective last known addresses, as reflected in
the records of the Payments Administrator and (iii) if the Escrow Agreement
then remains in effect, the Escrow Agent at the address set forth in the
Escrow Agreement. If the Equityholders' Representative shall give notice of
its, his or her intent to resign, or is unable to or ceases to act as the
Equityholders' Representative for any reason, the holders of twenty-five
percent (25%) or more, in aggregate, of the shares of Preferred Stock and
Common Stock (excluding shares of Series D Preferred Stock) outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with each share of Common Stock
entitled to one vote per share and with each share of Preferred Stock entitled
to the number of votes equal to the largest number of whole shares of Common
Stock into which such share of Preferred Stock could be converted at the
Effective Time) may appoint a successor Equityholders' Representative by
written notice to (A) Parent in accordance with Section 11.2 hereof, (B) each
other former holder of shares of Preferred Stock and Common Stock (other than
any such holders who held only shares of Series D Preferred Stock) at such
former holder's last known address, as reflected in the records of the
Payments Administrator and (C) if the Escrow Agreement then remains in effect,
the Escrow Agent at the address set forth in the Escrow Agreement; provided,
however, that if more than one successor Equityholders' Representative shall
be proposed on or before the date that is twenty (20) days after the
Equityholders' Representative shall give notice of intent to resign, or is
unable to or ceases to act as Equityholders' Representative, by holders of
twenty-five percent (25%) or more, in aggregate, of the shares of Preferred
Stock and

 

M-4  

Common Stock (excluding shares of Series D Preferred Stock) outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with each share of Common Stock
entitled to one vote per share and with each share of Preferred Stock entitled
to the number of votes equal to the largest number of whole shares of Common
Stock into which such share of Preferred Stock could be converted at the
Effective Time), the successor proposed by holders of the largest number of
such shares outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
serve as the successor Equityholders' Representative. After the
Equityholders' Representative's resignation or removal hereunder, the
provisions of this Exhibit M shall continue in effect with respect to the
Equityholders' Representative who resigned or was removed in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by Equityholders' Representative while
he, she or it was acting as Equityholders' Representative.

 

(h)Actions of Equityholders' Representative. Any action taken by the
Equityholders' Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this
Exhibit M shall be effective and absolutely binding on each Equityholder
notwithstanding any contrary action of, or direction from, any Equityholder,
except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct by the Equityholders'
Representative.
