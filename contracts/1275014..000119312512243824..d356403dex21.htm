ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

 

Section 2.01. _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be
merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware
Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving company (the "Surviving Company").

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of Article 11, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 1600
El Camino Real, Menlo Park, California, 94025 as soon as possible, but in any
event no later than two Business Days after the date the conditions set forth
in Article 11 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible,
waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the
extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of
such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other
date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree (the "Closing Date"). The
Closing shall be deemed to have occurred effective as of 11:59 p.m. on the
Closing Date.

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such
later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

(c) At Closing, AIT shall pay in full, or cause to be paid in full with a
portion of the Merger Consideration, the Debt Pay-Off Amount in accordance
with the Pay-Off Letters.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall possess all
the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 



12 Section 2.02. _Conversion of Company Interest_. At the Effective Time:

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Membership
Interests held by AIT outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
which comprise all of the outstanding Membership Interests in the Company,
shall be converted into the right to receive (i) the Stock Consideration plus
(ii) the Cash Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all
Membership Interests shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in
lieu of any fractional share of Parent Stock pursuant to Section 2.05, in
each case to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without
interest.

(b) The membership interests of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become 100% of the
membership interests in the Surviving Company with the same rights, powers
and privileges as the membership interests so converted and which membership
interests shall constitute the only membership interests of the Surviving
Company. In accordance with Section 18-301(b)(3) of Delaware Law, the member
of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall hereby be
admitted to the Surviving Company as the sole member of the Surviving Company
upon the Effective Time, and upon the Effective Time the member of Merger
Subsidiary shall be the holder of 100% of the membership interests of the
Surviving Company. Concurrently therewith, AIT shall cease to be a member of
the Company and shall not be deemed a member of the Surviving Company, and the
Company shall continue as the Surviving Company without dissolution.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that an
amount equal to the Escrow Cash Holdback plus the Closing Adjustment Holdback
shall be deducted from the Cash Consideration payable to AIT pursuant to this
Article 2, and a number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the Escrow Stock
Holdback shall be deducted from the Stock Consideration payable to AIT
pursuant to this Article 2. The Escrow Holdback and the Closing Adjustment
Holdback shall be payable only (x) upon release from the Escrow Account in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and (y) to the extent
not reduced by adjustments pursuant to Section 2.09 and indemnification
payments pursuant to Article 12.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that AIT may direct
Parent to pay all or a portion of the Cash Consideration to one or more
lenders or creditors of the Outstanding Debt by wire transfer on the Closing
Date and any such amount so paid shall nevertheless be deemed paid to AIT for
all purposes of this Agreement.

 



13 Section 2.03. _Payment_.

 

(a) Subject to the foregoing, Parent shall deliver, at Closing, the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Membership Interests, as follows:

(i) a certificate (the "Parent Stock Certificate"), registered in the name of
AIT, representing the number of whole shares of Parent Stock that AIT has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(i) (less the Escrow Stock
Holdback, the certificate for which Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent,
pursuant to Section 2.10); and

(ii) the aggregate Cash Consideration that AIT has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(ii), as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.07 (less
the Escrow Cash Holdback and the Closing Adjustment Holdback, which Parent
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.10, less any amounts
deducted and paid to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 11.02(a) hereof).

Until Closing, such Membership Interests shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

Section 2.04. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Membership
Interests in the Company or the capital stock of Parent shall occur, including
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that results
from any exercise of options to purchase shares of Parents common
stock granted under Parents stock option or compensation plans or
arrangements, or any public offering of common stock or convertible securities
by Parent for cash proceeds, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately and correspondingly
adjusted.

Section 2.05. _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall
be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock that AIT would
otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated
and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, AIT shall
be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest
determined by multiplying the closing sale price of a share of Parent Stock on
Nasdaq on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time by the
fraction of a share of Parent Stock to which AIT would otherwise have been
entitled.

Section 2.06. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Surviving Company, Parent and the

 



14  Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the
Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts and duly
pays over such amounts to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Membership Interests in respect of which the Surviving Company or
Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

Section 2.07. _Initial Purchase Price Adjustments_. The Company will cause to
be delivered to Parent, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, (i) an estimated statement setting forth the Companys good faith
estimate of the Closing Adjustment (the "Estimated Closing Adjustment"), and
(ii) a certificate as to the preparation of the Estimated Closing Adjustment
executed by the principal financial officer of the Company.

(a) The Cash Consideration shall be adjusted as follows:

(i) if the Estimated Closing Adjustment is less than $0, the
Cash Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Estimated
Closing Adjustment (subject to the potential true up set forth in Section 2.09
below); and

 

(ii) if the Estimated Closing Adjustment is greater than $0, the Cash
Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the Estimated Closing
Adjustment (subject to the potential true up set forth in Section 2.09 below).

Section 2.08.  _Closing Balance Sheet_.

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Closing
Date, Parent will cause to be prepared, in a manner consistent with the
Companys accounting policies and practices as applied in the preparation of
the Company Financial Statements, and delivered to AIT the Closing Balance
Sheet, and a certificate based on such Closing Balance Sheet setting forth
Parents calculation of the Closing Adjustment, executed by the principal
financial officer of the Parent (the "Parent Closing Adjustment Certificate").

 

(b) If AIT disagrees with Parents calculation of the Closing Adjustment set
forth in the Parent Closing Adjustment Certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 2.08(a), AIT may, within 30 days after receipt of the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Parent Closing Adjustment Certificate, deliver a notice to
Parent disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth AITs calculation
of the Closing Adjustment (the "Dispute Notice"). The Dispute Notice shall
specify those items or amounts as to which AIT disagrees and the basis for
such

 



15  disagreement, and AIT shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items
and amounts contained in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Parent Closing
Adjustment Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.08(a).

(c) If a Dispute Notice shall be delivered pursuant to Section 2.08(b), Parent
and AIT shall, during the 30 days following such delivery, use all reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine, as may be required, the amount of the Final Closing Adjustment,
which amount shall not be less than the amount set forth in the Parent
Closing Adjustment Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.08(a) or more
than the amount set forth in the Dispute Notice delivered pursuant to Section
2.08(b). If, during such period, Parent and AIT are unable to reach such
agreement, they shall promptly thereafter (and not later than 15 days
thereafter) retain a firm of independent accountants of nationally recognized
standing reasonably satisfactory to Parent and AIT (who shall not have
any material relationship with Parent, AIT or the AIT Members) (the
"Designated Accounting Firm"), promptly to review and resolve the disputed
items and amounts of Closing Adjustment. In connection with the resolution of
any such dispute by the Designated Accounting Firm: (i) the Designated
Accounting Firm shall determine the Closing Adjustment in a manner consistent
with the Companys accounting policies and practices as applied in the
preparation of the Company Financial Statements, within 30 days of the
referral of the dispute to the Designated Accounting Firm; (ii) the Designated
Accounting Firm shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing
Balance Sheet or the Parent Closing Adjustment Certificate as to which AIT
has disagreed; (iii) each of Parent and AIT shall have a reasonable
opportunity to confer or meet with the Designated Accounting Firm to provide
its views as to any disputed issues with respect to the calculation of the
Closing Adjustment; _provided_ , that no meetings, discussions or
communications shall occur with the Designated Accounting Firm except in the
presence of both Parent and AIT; (iv) copies of all documents and information
provided to, and correspondence with, the Designated Accounting Firm by
either Parent or AIT shall be provided simultaneously to the other party; (v)
upon making its final determination of the Closing Adjustment, the Designated
Accounting Firm shall deliver a copy of its calculations to Parent and AIT;
and (vi) the determination of the Closing Adjustment made by the Designated
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on Parent and AIT for all purposes,
absent fraud or manifest error. The costs of the Designated Accounting Firm
shall be borne by Parent if the difference between the Final Closing
Adjustment and Parents calculation of the Closing Adjustment delivered
pursuant to Section 2.08(a) is greater than the difference between the Final
Closing Adjustment and AITs calculation of the Closing Adjustment delivered
pursuant to Section 2.08(b), and by AIT if the first such difference is less
than the second such difference and otherwise equally by Parent and AIT.

(d) Parent and the Company agree that they will, and agree to direct their
respective independent accountants to, cooperate and assist in the

 



16  preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing
Adjustment and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section 2.08,
including without limitation, the making available to the extent necessary of
books, records, work papers and personnel.

Section 2.09. _Adjustment of Merger Consideration_.

(a) "Final Closing Adjustment" means the Closing Adjustment if no Dispute
Notice is duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.08(b); or if a Dispute Notice
is duly delivered, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.08(c);
_provided_ that, in no event shall the Final Closing Adjustment be less than
Parents calculation of the Closing Adjustment set forth in the Parent
Closing Adjustment Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.08(a) or more
than AITs calculation of the Closing Adjustment set forth in the Dispute
Notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.08(b).

(b) If the Final Closing Adjustment is greater than the Estimated Closing
Adjustment, Parent shall owe to AIT an amount equal to the excess of the
Final Closing Adjustment over the Estimated Closing Adjustment. If the Final
Closing Adjustment is less than the Estimated Closing Adjustment, AIT shall
owe Parent an amount equal to the excess of the Estimated Closing Adjustment
over the Final Closing Adjustment (such amount described in this Section
2.09(b), the "Final Closing Adjustment Payment").

 

(i) If Parent owes the Final Closing Adjustment Payment to AIT, then AIT shall
be entitled to withdraw from the Escrow Account an amount in cash equal to
the Closing Adjustment Holdback and Parent shall pay to AIT an amount in cash
equal to the Final Closing Adjustment Payment within five (5) Business Days of
the determination of the Final Closing Adjustment Payment.

(ii) If AIT owes the Final Closing Adjustment Payment to Parent, then:

 

(A) if the Final Closing Adjustment Payment is equal to or less than the
Closing Adjustment Holdback, Parent shall withdraw from the Escrow Account an
amount in cash equal to the Final Closing Adjustment Payment, and the excess
of the Closing Adjustment Holdback, if any, over the Final Closing Adjustment
Payment shall be distributed from the Escrow Account to AIT; and

(B) if the Final Closing Adjustment Payment exceeds the Closing Adjustment
Holdback (such excess, the "Shortfall"), then Parent shall be entitled to, at
its option and if not previously paid by AIT: (1) withdraw from the Escrow
Account an amount in cash equal to the Closing Adjustment Holdback; (2) at
Parents 

 



17  option, withdraw from the Escrow Account an amount in cash equal to all or
any portion of the Escrow Cash Holdback, up to the Shortfall, and (3) require
AIT to, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of notice of the
determination of the Final Closing Adjustment Payment, (A) pay to Parent an
amount in cash equal to the Shortfall, if any, that is not satisfied from the
Escrow Account, and (B) deposit into the Escrow Account an amount in cash
equal to the Shortfall, if any, that was satisfied by release to Parent of the
Escrow Cash Holdback. Such amounts paid by AIT to replenish the Escrow Cash
Holdback shall be treated as Escrow Cash Holdback for all purposes under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

With respect to any payment to Parent or AIT in connection with adjustments
to the Escrow Account pursuant to this Section 2.09, AIT and Parent shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent, within two (2) Business Days following the
determination of the Final Closing Adjustment Payment, a written notice
executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to make such payment to
Parent or AIT, as the case may be, from the Escrow Amount.

Section 2.10.  _Escrow_.

(a) Prior to or simultaneously with the Effective Time, AIT and Parent shall
enter into an escrow agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA (the "Escrow
Agent") substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Escrow
Agreement"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall withhold from the Merger
Consideration and deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount in cash equal to
the Escrow Cash Holdback plus the Closing Adjustment Holdback and one or more
certificates representing the Escrow Stock Holdback (together, the "Escrow
Fund"), to be held in an account (the "Escrow Account") governed by the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and managed by the
Escrow Agent.

(b) The Escrow Fund shall constitute security solely for (i) adjustments to
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.09 and (ii) the indemnification
obligations of AIT pursuant to Article 12, and shall be held in and
distributed from the Escrow Account in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agreement shall provide that
any amount of the Closing Adjustment Holdback remaining in the Escrow Account
following either (i) the payment to Parent of the Final Closing Adjustment
Payment pursuant to Section 2.09, or (ii) the final determination pursuant to
Section 2.09 that no such Final Closing Adjustment Payment is owed to Parent,
shall be released to AIT subject to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
The Escrow Agreement shall also provide that any amount of the Escrow Holdback
remaining in the Escrow Account, and not the subject of a 

 



18  claim duly and timely made in accordance with Article 12 hereof, on the date
that is fifteen (15) months following the Closing shall be released to AIT
subject to this Agreement, including Section 12.01 hereof, and the Escrow
Agreement.

Subject to Section 14.04, except as set forth in the Company Disclosure

company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware and has all requisite limited liability company

consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted.
The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would

(l) The Company or its Subsidiaries filed IRS Form 1099s and any comparable
state, local or non-U.S. Tax Returns with respect to the two individuals
referenced in Item 1 of Schedule 4.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedules for
the tax periods between the date the Company acquired Integrated Flow Systems
LLC and December 31, 2011.

Section 4.19. _Employee Benefit Plans._ (a) Section 4.19 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list identifying each
"employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, each employment,
severance or similar contract, plan, arrangement or policy and each other
plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing for compensation, bonuses,
profit-sharing, loans, stock option or other stock related rights or other
forms of incentive or deferred compensation, vacation benefits, insurance
(including any self-insured arrangements), health or medical benefits,
employee assistance program, disability or sick leave benefits, workers
compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and post-
employment or retirement benefits (including compensation, pension, health,
medical or life insurance benefits) which is maintained, administered or
contributed to by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate and covers any employee
or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
(collectively, the "Employee Plans"). Copies of the Employee Plans (and, if
applicable, related trust or funding agreements or insurance policies) and
all amendments thereto and written interpretations thereof

 



31  have been furnished to Parent together with the most recent annual report
(Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto) and tax return (Form
990) prepared in connection with any such plan or trust. Section 4.19 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule separately identifies each Employee Plan that is
an International Plan.

(b) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any predecessor thereof
participates in or contributes to, or has in the past participated in or
contributed to, any multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA
(a "Multiemployer Plan").

(c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any predecessor thereof
sponsors, maintains or contributes to, or has in the past sponsored,
maintained or contributed to, any Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA
or any International Plan that is a defined benefit plan.

 

(d) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter, or has pending or
has time remaining in which to file, an application for such determination
from the Internal Revenue Service, and the Company is not aware of any reason
why any such determination letter should be revoked or not be reissued. The
Company has made available to Parent copies of the most recent Internal
Revenue Service determination letters with respect to each such Employee Plan.

(e) Each Employee Plan has been maintained in material compliance with its
terms and all Applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, which are
applicable to such Employee Plan.

 

(f) No material events have occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that
could result in payment or assessment by or against the Company of any excise
taxes. With respect to any Employee Plan covered by Subtitle B, Part 4 of
Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, no non-exempt prohibited
transaction has occurred that has caused or would reasonably be expected
to cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any material
liability under ERISA or the Code.

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (either alone or together with any other event) entitle any employee or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance
pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any Employee Plan. There is no contract, plan or arrangement
(written or otherwise) covering any employee or former employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, would entitle
any employee or former employee to any severance or other payment solely as
a 

 



32  result of the transactions contemplated hereby, or could give rise to the
payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of
Section 280G of the Code.

 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in
respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries except
as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code or other
Applicable Law.

 

(i) No Employee Plan is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse
any current or former service provider for any tax incurred by such service
provider under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code. 

(j) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to,
or change in employee participation or coverage under, an Employee Plan which
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan above
the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the year ended
December 31, 2011.

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject
to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any
collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding with a
labor union or similar organization.

(l) All contributions, premiums and payments that are due have been made for
each Employee Plan within the time periods prescribed by the terms of such
plan and Applicable Law, and all contributions, premiums and payments for any
period ending on or before the Closing Date that are not due are properly
accrued to the extent required to be accrued under applicable accounting
principles.

 

(m) There is no action, suit, investigation, audit or proceeding (other than
routine claims for benefits) pending against or involving or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or involving, any Employee Plan
before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority.

Section 4.20. _Labor Matters_. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
material compliance with all Applicable Laws relating to labor and employment,
including those relating to labor management relations, wages, hours,

33  under group health plans, wage payment and the payment and withholding of
taxes. There is no labor strike, slowdown, stoppage, picketing, interruption
of work or lockout pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The consent or
consultation of, or the rendering of formal advice by, any labor or trade
union, works council or other employee representative body is not required
for the Company to enter into this Agreement or to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.21. _Inventories_. The inventories set forth in the Company Balance
Sheet were properly stated therein at the lesser of cost or fair market value
determined in accordance with GAAP consistently maintained and applied by the
Company. Since the Company Balance Sheet Date, the inventories of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been maintained in the ordinary course of business.
All such inventories are owned free and clear of all Liens, except for
Permitted Encumbrances. All of the inventories recorded on the Company Balance

taken as a whole, in any material respect. As of the Applicable Time, the
Company has not received any written notice of an intention to terminate any

distribution thereof. AIT understands, and AIT will ensure that each AIT
Member understands, that the issuance of the shares of Parent Stock pursuant
to this Agreement has not been, and will not be, registered under the 1933 Act

such Persons representations as expressed herein.

of, the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 Act which
permit limited resale of shares purchased in a private placement subject to
the satisfaction of certain conditions.

Section 5.04.  _Restrictions on Transfer; Restrictive Legends_. AIT
acknowledges, on behalf of itself and AIT Members, that the transfer of the
shares of Parent Stock is restricted by applicable state and federal

business as now conducted. AIT is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such

so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have individually or in the
aggregate a Material Adverse Effect on AIT. AIT is not in violation of any of
the provisions of its limited liability company agreement.

Section 5.06. _Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by AIT
of this Agreement and the consummation by AIT of the transactions contemplated
hereby are within AITs requisite powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of such party. Assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of AIT enforceable against AIT in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditors rights generally and general principles of equity, regardless of
whether such enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

Section 5.07. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by AIT of this Agreement and the consummation by AIT of the
transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority other than: compliance with
any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, and any other
applicable state or federal securities laws; compliance with any applicable
requirements of the HSR Act and of laws analogous to the HSR Act existing in
foreign jurisdictions; and any actions or filings the absence of which would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on AIT.

Section 5.08. _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
AIT of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby do not and will not (a) contravene, conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of formation, limited
liability company agreement or other organizational documents of AIT, (b) )
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.07, contravene,
conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any

(c) require any consent or other action by any Person under, or constitute a
default under, any provision of any material agreement or other material
instrument binding upon AIT which would adversely affect AIT in any material

superseded by a filing before the date of this Agreement, then on the date of
such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements
of Parent included or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Filings
fairly present in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject to normal year end audit
adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial statements) and
comply in all material respects with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

against or affecting, Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, any present or former
officer, director or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
other Person for whom Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable or any
of their respective properties before (or, in the case of threatened actions,
suits, investigations or proceedings, would be before) or by any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator that, if determined or resolved adversely in
accordance with the plaintiffs demands, would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on the business of
the Parent or which in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin,
alter or materially delay the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

with past practices and there has not been any event having a Material Adverse
Effect on the Parent.

be, in material compliance with all such listing and maintenance requirements
as in effect on the date hereof.

Section 6.13.  _Certain Registration Matters_. Assuming the accuracy of AITs
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.01 to 5.04, a
registration statement under the Securities Act is not required for the
issuance of the Parent Stock to AIT under this Agreement, other than as
provided for in the Registration Rights Agreement.

operations of the Surviving Company or Parent; (B) be only to the extent
necessary to permit AIT to determine any matter relating to its rights and
obligations hereunder or to any period ending on or before the Closing Date;
(C) not require providing access to any of the Surviving Companys or Parents

is entered or threatened to be entered, in each case challenging the
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of the HSR Act or any other antitrust law, the parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to contest, avoid, vacate, modify,
or suspend each such Proceeding or Order, including through litigation.

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 10.01. _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

(a) Within 120 days after the Closing, Parent shall deliver to AIT a statement
(the "Allocation Statement"), allocating the Merger Consideration among the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code. If within 30 days after the delivery of the Allocation Statement AIT
notifies Parent in writing that it objects to the allocation set forth in the
Allocation Statement, Parent and AIT shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such dispute within 20 days. In the event that Parent and
AIT are unable to resolve such dispute within 20 days, Parent and AIT shall
jointly retain a nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Accounting
Referee") to resolve the disputed items. Upon resolution of the disputed
items, the allocation reflected on the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted
to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting
Referee shall be borne equally by Parent and AIT.

 



55 (b) Parent and AIT agree to (i) be bound by the Allocation Statement for all
Tax purposes and (ii) act in accordance with the Allocation in the
preparation, filing and audit of any Tax return (including filing Form 8594
with its federal income Tax return for the taxable year that includes the date
of the Closing). 

(c) Not later than 30 days prior to the filing of their respective Forms 8594
relating to this transaction, each party shall deliver to the other party a
copy of its Form 8594.

Section 10.02. _Tax Covenants_.

 

(a) Without the prior written consent of Parent, none of AIT, the Company, nor
any of the Companys Subsidiaries shall, to the extent it may affect or
relate to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, make or change any Tax
election, change any annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method
of Tax accounting, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any
closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment, surrender any right to
claim a Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability, consent to any
extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or
assessment or, if it would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability or
reducing any Tax asset of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any
Affiliate of Parent, take or omit to take any other action outside of the
ordinary course of business.

 

(b) All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax and any similar
Tax) shall be borne equally by Parent and AIT, and Parent will file all
necessary Tax Returns with respect to all such Taxes, and, if required by
applicable law, AIT will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns; _provided_ that any Transfer Taxes imposed
with respect to the Disposal shall be borne by AIT. The costs and expenses
associated with the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns shall be borne
equally by Parent and AIT. 

Section 10.03. _Tax Cooperation_. Parent and AIT shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of any Tax Return, any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Parent and AIT agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company and

 



56  the Subsidiaries relating to any Pre Closing Tax Period until the expiration
of any applicable statute of limitations, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority for all periods required by
such Taxing Authority.

Section 10.04. _Apportionment of Taxes_. For purposes of the determination of
the Covered Tax described in Clauses (A) of the definition thereof in respect
of a Tax Period that commences on or before but ends after the Closing Date,
(x) in the case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales or use Taxes
and Taxes based upon or related to income, the definition of Covered Tax shall
be deemed to include the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross receipts, sales or use
Tax, the definition of Covered Tax shall be deemed to include the amount that
would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing
Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the allocation set forth
in the foregoing clause (y) shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 10.05. _Tax Claims_. Parent agrees to give prompt notice to AIT of
the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or
proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought under Section
12.02(a)(ii) (a "Tax Claim"). AIT may, at its own expense, (a) participate in
and (b) with respect to any suits, actions or proceedings (including Tax
audits) that relate solely to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, assume the defense of
any such suit, action or proceeding (including any Tax audit); provided that
(i) AITs counsel is reasonably satisfactory to Parent, (ii) AIT shall
thereafter consult with Parent upon Parents reasonable request for such
consultation from time to time with respect to such suit, action or
proceeding (including any Tax audit) and (iii) AIT shall not, without Parents
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, agree to
any settlement with respect to any Tax if such settlement could adversely
affect the Tax liability of Parent or any of its Affiliates. Parent shall have
the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by AIT
and AIT shall not assert that the Damages with respect to the Covered Tax, or
any portion thereof, with respect to which Buyer seeks indemnification is not
subject to indemnification. Parent shall not settle any suit, action or
proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder without the
consent of AIT, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless AIT elects not to assume such defense. AIT shall be liable for the fees
and expenses of counsel employed by Parent for any period during which AIT
has not assumed the defense thereof. Whether or not AIT chooses to defend or
prosecute any claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof.

 



57 Section 10.06. _Certain Disputes_. Disputes that arise under this Article 10
and are not resolved by mutual agreement within 30 days shall be resolved by
a nationally recognized expert in the relevant area with no material
relationship with Parent or AIT or their Affiliates (the "Referee"), chosen
and mutually acceptable to both Parent and AIT within five days of the date
on which the need to choose the Referee arises. The Referee shall resolve any
disputed items within 30 days of having the item referred to it pursuant to
such procedures as it may require. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Referee shall be borne equally by Parent and AIT.

ARTICLE 12

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 12.01.  _Survival_. The Companys and AITs representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time and
continue in effect for a period of fifteen (15) months following the Closing
Date,

 



61  except for the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.05,
Section 4.06, Section 4.18, and Section 4.23 which shall survive the Effective
Time and continue in effect for the full period of all applicable statutes of
limitations. The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant
hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the Closing Date indefinitely
or for the shorter period explicitly specified therein, except that for such
covenants and agreements that survive for such shorter period, breaches
thereof shall survive indefinitely or until the latest date permitted by law.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise
terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences, if written notice, pursuant to
and with the detail required by Section 12.03, of the inaccuracy or breach
thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have been given to the
party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time. All of
Parents and Merger Subsidiarys representations and warranties contained
herein or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
terminate on the date that is fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date.

Section 12.02. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Parent and its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company and any of its Subsidiaries), officers, directors,
employees agents, successors and assigns (each, an "Indemnified Party" and
collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified and held
harmless by AIT from any Damages incurred or suffered by any Indemnified
Party as a result or arising out of any of the following:

(i) (x) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty (without giving effect to
any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained
therein in determining the amount of any Damages) of AIT or the Company
contained in this Agreement and (y) the matters described in (1) Item 8 of
Schedule 4.10 in the Company Disclosure Schedules, to the extent Damages
relating to such matter were not accrued on the Company Balance Sheet, and (2)
Item 1 of Schedule 4.20 in the Company Disclosure Schedules as it relates to
employee benefit plans and labor matters (each such misrepresentation, breach
or matter, a "Warranty Breach");

(ii) without duplication of any claim pursuant to Section 12.02(a)(i), any
breach of a Fundamental Representation;

 

(iii) any Covered Taxes, except to the extent that such Covered Taxes (x) were
due and payable, and were timely paid by the Company or AIT, at or prior to
Closing, and the records of which were retained in the books and records of
the Company or otherwise made available to the Parent at or prior to Closing,
or (y) reflect Parents share of Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section 10.02(b);

 



62 (iv) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by
the Company or AIT pursuant to this Agreement; and

(v) any non-payment when due by AIT of amounts due to Parent pursuant to
Section 2.09 or any non-payment when due of amounts required to be paid by AIT
to replenish the Escrow Account pursuant to Section 2.09.

(b) From and after the Closing, except for (i) claims based upon fraud or
intentional misrepresentation and (ii) misrepresentations or breaches of the
Fundamental Representations, the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article 12 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and the other
Indemnified Parties for any Warranty Breach.

(c) No Indemnified Party will seek indemnification under Section 12.02(a)(i)
until the date on which all unreimbursed claims by parties entitled to
indemnification thereunder exceeds $750,000 in the aggregate (such amount,
the "Deductible Amount"), in which case the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnity only for the amount of its Damages exceeding $375,000.
The maximum aggregate liability of AIT for indemnification under Section
12.02(a)(i) shall not exceed the Escrow Holdback Amount (the "Warranty Cap").
The maximum aggregate liability of AIT for indemnification under Section
12.02(a) (including without limitation any liability of AIT for
indemnification under Section 12.02(a)(i)) shall be $65,000,000 (together with
the Warranty Cap, the "Applicable Caps").

Section 12.03. _Indemnification Notice Procedures._ Any Indemnified Party
seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 12.02 shall give AIT and the
Escrow Agent, if applicable, notice in reasonable detail of any matter that
such Indemnified Party has determined has given rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement, stating the amount of Damages, if known,
and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the specific
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises. The procedures relating to indemnification claims
against the Escrow Fund shall be further governed, where applicable, by the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

Section 12.04. _Third Party Claim Procedures._

 

(a) Any Indemnified Party agrees to give (i) prompt notice in writing (but in
no event more than fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Party acquires
knowledge thereof) to AIT of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of
any suit, action or proceeding by any Third Party (other than a Tax Claim, the
procedure for which shall be governed solely by Section 10.05) ("Third Party

 



63  Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section and
(ii) copies of all documents and information relating to any such Third Party
Claim within fifteen (15) days of their being obtained by the Indemnified
Party. Such notice shall describe such Third Party Claim in reasonable detail
and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then
available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify or provide such
documents or information to AIT shall not relieve AIT of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent AIT demonstrates that the defense of such
Third Party Claim is materially and adversely prejudiced by such failure.

(b) AIT shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party
Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section, shall be
entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such defense, in each case at
its own expense; provided that prior to assuming control of such defense, AIT
must (i) acknowledge that it would have an indemnity obligation for the
Damages resulting from such Third Party Claim as provided under this Article
and (ii) furnish the Indemnified Party with evidence that AIT has adequate
resources to defend the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnity
obligations hereunder.

(c) AIT shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of
any Third Party Claim and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained
by the Indemnified Party if (i) AIT does not deliver the acknowledgment
referred to in Section 12.04(b) within 10 days of receipt of notice of the
Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 12.04(a), (ii) the Third Party Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (iii) the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to the Third Party
Claim would be detrimental to the reputation or future business prospects of
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iv) the Third Party Claim
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any
of its affiliates, or (v) AIT has failed or is failing to prosecute or defend
vigorously the Third Party Claim.

(d) If AIT shall assume the control of the defense of any Third Party Claim in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.04, AIT shall obtain the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party before entering into any
settlement of such Third Party Claim, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(e) In circumstances where AIT is controlling the defense of a Third Party
Claim in accordance with Section 12.04(b) and Section 12.04(c), the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose, in which case the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be
borne by the Indemnified Party; provided that in such event AIT shall pay the
fees and expenses of such separate counsel (i) incurred by the Indemnified
Party prior to the date AIT assumes control of the defense of the Third Party
Claim or (ii) if representation of both AIT and the Indemnified Party by the
same counsel would create a conflict of interest.

 



64 (f) Each party shall cooperate, AIT shall cause its Affiliates to cooperate
and Parent shall cause its directors and officers to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to
be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(g) Notwithstanding any terms to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect
to the indemnification obligation set forth in Section 12.02(a)(i)(y)(1),
during the period specified in Section 12.01, (i) no Indemnified Party may
contact such creditor or its counsel or other agents or representatives
relating to such matter without the prior written consent of AIT, which may be
withheld in AITs sole discretion, (ii) AIT shall control the defense of any
claims relating to such matters in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 12.04 and (iii) an Indemnified Party shall obtain the prior written
consent of AIT before entering into any settlement of such claim, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

Section 12.05. _Payment of Indemnification Obligation._

(a) Upon (i) a final determination of an indemnification claim made by an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 12, whereby such final
determination is by reason of (ii) the mutual agreement of Parent and AIT in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, (iii) a
failure of AIT to object to an indemnification notice under Section 12.04 of
this Agreement or a Claim Certificate (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) in
accordance with the procedures set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement,
(iv) a final, nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, (v)
a final, binding, and conclusive decision of an arbitrator or arbitrators
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement or (vi) a determination of an indemnification
claim with respect to Covered Taxes pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Article 10, then the amount of the Damages stated in such claim or otherwise
agreed to or determined, as applicable, shall first be paid from the Escrow
Fund out of the Escrow Cash Holdback in cash and out of the Escrow Stock
Holdback in shares of Parent Stock, each at the applicable Escrow Proportion,
up to the amount of the Escrow Holdback, subject to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. Then, subject to the Applicable Caps, AIT shall pay to Parent the
portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration, if any, that AIT has not
distributed to the AIT Members. 

(b) Parent agrees that in the event of any breach giving rise to an
indemnification obligation of AIT hereunder (other than an indemnification
obligation with respect to Taxes), Parent shall take, or cooperate with AIT if
so requested by it in order to take, all reasonable measures to mitigate the
consequences of the related breach (including taking reasonable steps
to prevent any contingent liability from becoming an actual liability).

 



65 (c) The amount of any claim by an Indemnified Party for indemnification
pursuant to Section 12.02 shall be computed net of aggregate amounts actually
recovered under any indemnity agreement, contribution agreement, or other
contract (other than an insurance policy) between the Parent, the Company or
any other Affiliated entity, on the one hand, and any third party, on the
other hand. Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to seek recovery under any insurance policy or any indemnification agreement,
contribution agreement or other contract with any other third party that
would reasonably be expected to be available to reimburse any Damages;
_provided_ , that an Indemnified Party shall not be required to file any claim
with respect to any such insurance coverage (i) in the event that such
Indemnified Party has other claims under such insurance policies that, when
taken together with such Damages, would exceed the policy limits of the
applicable insurance policies, or (ii) where such Indemnified Party
reasonably concludes that seeking insurance coverage for such Damages would
materially and adversely affect such Indemnified Partys claims history,
insurance premium, or ability to renew or replace such insurance coverage on
acceptable terms. If the Indemnified Party actually receives any amounts
under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment related
to such Damages by AIT, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse
AIT for any payment made to the Indemnified Party for such Damages (up to the
amount received by the indemnified party, but not to exceed the amount of such
Damages actually paid by the indemnifying party), net of (x) any expenses
incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amounts, (y) the net
present value of any increase in premiums that arises out of or relates to the
relevant claim and (z) any portion of Damages incurred by such Indemnified
Party that such Indemnified Party would have been entitled to receive from AIT
but for the Deductible Amount or the Applicable Caps.

(d) Parent and AIT agree to treat any indemnification payment pursuant to
Section 12.02 as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax
purposes unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. 

ARTICLE 13

TERMINATION

Section 13.01. _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

 



66 (i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before ninety (90) days after
the date of execution of this Agreement (the "End Date"); _provided_ that the
End Date shall be extended for thirty days if the only reason the Merger has
not been consummated on or before ninety days after the date of execution of
this Agreement is that the condition set forth in Section 11.01(b) has not
been fulfilled (provided that such extension shall not be available to any
party whose breach of any provisions in this Agreement resulted in the failure
of such condition to be fulfilled); _provided further_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 13.01(b)(i) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results
in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time; or

(ii) there shall be any Applicable Law that (A) makes consummation of the
Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or (B) enjoins the Company or Parent
from consummating the Merger and such injunction shall have become final and
nonappealable.

 

(c) by Parent, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in
this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in
Section 11.02(a) not to be satisfied, and such condition has not been and is
incapable of being satisfied by the End Date; or

 

(d) by the Company, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the Parent or Merger
Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause
the condition set forth in Section 11.03(a) not to be satisfied, and such
condition is incapable of being satisfied by the End Date.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 13.01
(other than pursuant to Section 13.01(a)) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

Section 13.02. _Effect of Termination._ Each partys right of
termination under Section 13.01 is in addition to any other rights it may
have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of
termination will not be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 13.01, this Agreement shall become void and of
no effect without liability of any party (or any stockholder, member, manager,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such
party) to the other party hereto; provided that, if such termination shall
result from the intentional (a) failure of either party to fulfill a condition
to the performance of the obligations of the other party, (b) failure of
either party to perform a covenant hereof or (c) breach by either party
hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement contained herein, such
party shall be fully liable for any and all liabilities and damages incurred
or

 



67  suffered by the other party as a result of such failure. The provisions of
this Section 13.02 and Sections 9.04, 14.03, 14.06, 14.07 and 14.08 shall
survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 13.01.

by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or

warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other
representations and warranties of such party that is contained in this
Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or
a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties would be
readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that reference and
such representations and warranties, without any independent knowledge on the
part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed. By listing matters on
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, shall not be deemed, solely as a result of such
listing, to have established any materiality standard, admitted any liability
or expanded in any way the scope or effect of the representations and
warranties of Company contained in this Agreement.

Section 14.05. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment._ (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 8.01,

this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time, and (ii) after the

enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

 

Section 14.06. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state (other than Sections 5-1401

or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter

contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or
against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the state
courts located in the State of New York, City of New York, Borough of
Manhattan, or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court
located in the State of New York, City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, and
each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party

ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 



70 Section 14.09. _Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral
or written agreement or other communication).

Section 14.10. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, including its exhibits,
annexes and schedules, the Ancillary Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement
dated February 15, 2012 and the Exclusivity Agreement dated March 5, 2012
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter therein and herein and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter therein and herein.

 

Section 14.11. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 14.12. _Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in any federal court located in the State of New York or any New York state
court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.
