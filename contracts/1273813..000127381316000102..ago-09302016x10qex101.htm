providing service under the Transitional Services Agreement who voluntarily
terminates his or her employment prior to 31 May 2017 (or such earlier date as
the services relevant to such Employee cease to be provided). It is

arising in relation to the engagement after the Completion Date or, if
relevant, after a person ceases to provide services under the Transitional
Services Agreement or termination of 

 

engagement after the Completion Date or, if relevant, after completion of the

14.2

|

Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it has not been induced to enter into

be required by law, in which event the deduction or withholding will not
exceed the minimum amount which it is required by law to deduct or withhold
and, in the case of payments from the Seller to the Purchaser, the payer will
simultaneously pay to the payee such additional amounts as will result in the
receipt by the payee of a net amount equal to the full amount which would
otherwise have been receivable had no deduction or withholding been required. 

 

| 
---|--- 

15.2

|

If any amount payable to the Purchaser by the Seller for or in connection with
any Warranty Claim or a Tax Covenant Claim is subject to Tax, that amount

been retained by the Purchaser but for the Tax.

Severability 

| 
---|--- 

19.1

|

If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the
law of any jurisdiction, then such provision shall (so far as it is invalid or
unenforceable) be given no effect and shall be deemed not to be included in
this Agreement but without invalidating any of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable
only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not
held invalid or unenforceable. 

 

The Parties shall then use all reasonable endeavours to replace the invalid or
unenforceable provision(s) by a valid and enforceable substitute provision the
effect of which is as close as possible to the intended effect of the invalid
or unenforceable provision.

| 
---|--- 

20.4

|

Provided that, in the case of an assignment pursuant to Clause 20.3, then the
liability of any Party to such an assignee and all other persons shall not be

commencement of a Third Party Claim against any such Party in respect of which
the other Party (the "Compensating Party") may be obligated to provide
compensation under this Agreement (other than in respect of a Tax Covenant
Claim or Warranty Claim in respect of the Tax Warranties), the Notified Party
shall give the Compensating Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof
(but in no event later than 30 (thirty) calendar days after becoming aware

based on the facts known at the time and any documents relating to the claim
and an estimate of the Loss and shall reference the specific sections of this

notice). Thereafter, the Notified Party shall deliver to the Compensating

The Compensating Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim (other than in respect of a Tax Covenant Claim or Warranty
Claim in respect of the Tax Warranties) and, if it so chooses, to assume the
defence thereof with a counsel of its choice. Should the Compensating Party so
elect to assume the defence of a Third Party Claim, it shall not, as long as
it conducts such defence, be liable to the Notified Party for legal expenses
incurred by the Notified Party in connection with the defence thereof. If the
Compensating Party assumes such defence, the Notified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defence thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Compensating Party, it
being understood that the Compensating Party shall control such defence. The
Compensating Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Notified Party for any period during which the

period in which the Notified Party shall have not yet given notice of the
Third Party Claim as provided above). If the Compensating Party chooses to
defend any Third Party Claim, the Parties shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to) cooperate in the defence thereof. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the Compensating Party's request) the
provision to the Compensating Party of records and information that are
relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Compensating Party shall
have assumed the defence of a Third Party Claim, the Notified Party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or pay, settle, compromise or discharge,
such Third Party Claim without the Compensating Party's prior written consent.
If the Compensating Party has assumed the defence of a Third Party Claim, the
Compensating Party may only pay, settle, compromise or discharge a Third Party
Claim with the Notified Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) provided, that the
Compensating Party may pay, settle, compromise or discharge such a Third Party
Claim without the written consent of the Notified Party if such settlement (i)
includes a release of the Notified Party from all liability in respect of such
Third Party Claim, (ii) does not subject the Notified Party to any injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy and (iii) does not include a statement or
admission of fault culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the
Notified Party. If the Compensating Party submits to the Notified Party a bona
fide settlement offer that satisfies the requirements set forth in the proviso
of the immediately preceding sentence and the Notified Party refuses to
consent to such settlement, then thereafter the Compensating Party's liability
to the Notified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed
the Compensating Party's portion of the settlement amount included in such
settlement offer, and the Notified Party shall either assume the defence of
such Third Party Claim or pay the Compensating Party's attorney's 

 

fees and other out-of-pocket costs incurred thereafter in continuing the
defence of such Third Party Claim.

damages or consequential damages unless probable and reasonably foreseeable
(in either case except to the extent incurred by a third party and actually
paid to such third party in connection with a Third Party Claim). 

|

5.

|

Recovery of Losses 

| 
---|--- 

5.1

|

If, before or after any amount is paid in discharge of all or part of any
Warranty Claim (other than in respect of a Tax Warranty) and an amount is
recovered and actually received by the Purchaser or a member of the
Purchaser's Group from a third party (including any Tax Authority or insurer)
in respect of the matter in relation to which the Warranty Claim was made, the
Purchaser shall, or shall procure that the relevant member of the Purchaser's
Group shall, forthwith promptly repay to the Seller a sum corresponding to the
amount recovered from the third party net of reasonable out of pocket expenses
of the Purchaser or relevant member of the Purchaser's Group (as the case may
be) and net of any Tax suffered thereon relating to such recovery and subject
to the maximum repayment being equal to the amount paid by the Seller in
discharge of all or part of such Warranty Claim. The Purchaser shall (and
shall procure that each member of the Purchaser's Group shall) exercise
commercially reasonable endeavours to recover any such loss or amount from any
relevant third party. 

| 
---|--- 

5.2

|

If the event giving rise to a Warranty Claim (other than in respect of a Tax
Warranty) produces a saving or benefit for the Purchaser and/or a member of
the Purchaser's Group (including in relation to Tax), the Purchaser shall
procure that the saving or benefit and the amount of it will either be taken
into account in reducing the amount of the Warranty Claim or, if the Seller
has paid an amount in discharge of that Warranty Claim without such saving or
benefit being taken into account, then the amount by which such saving or
benefit would have reduced the liability so discharged shall be repaid
promptly to the Seller less the Purchaser's reasonable out of pocket expenses
(if any) incurred in obtaining the saving or benefit. 

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

Adjustment of Consideration 

Any payment made under this Agreement pursuant to a Warranty Claim or the Tax
Covenant shall be regarded as an adjustment to the Consideration to the extent
permissible by Applicable Law.

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

Mitigation 

The Purchaser agrees to take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate its
Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Warranty Claim.



| 
---|--- 

8.

|

No Liability for Contingent or Non-quantifiable Claims 

If any Warranty Claim arises by reason of some liability of the Purchaser or
the Company which, at the time such breach or claim is notified to the Seller,
is contingent only or otherwise not capable of being quantified, then the
Seller shall not be under any obligation to make any payment in respect of
such Warranty Claim unless and until such liability ceases to be contingent or
becomes capable of being quantified, provided that nothing in this paragraph 8
shall prevent the Purchaser from notifying the Seller of any Warranty Claim or
commencing legal proceedings in respect thereof as required under paragraph 1.

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

Future Legislation and Agreed Matters 

No liability shall arise under any Transaction Document in respect of any
matter, act, omission or circumstance (or any combination thereof), including
the aggravation of a matter or circumstance and any Losses arising therefrom,
to the extent that the same would not have occurred but for:

| 
---|---

practice of any Governmental Authority after the date of this Agreement; or 

| 
---|---

written opinion from counsel or an accountancy firm confirming that such
change was necessary to so comply. 

| 
---|--- 

10.

|

Acts of the Purchaser

Tax Warranty) to the extent that such Warranty Claim would not have arisen but
for any act, omission, transaction or arrangement carried out at, and in
accordance with, the written request of the Purchaser before Completion.

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

No Double Recovery 

The Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover more than once for the same
matter, event or Loss.

| 
---|--- 

12.

|

Exclusive Remedy 

Other than any cause of action arising out of actual fraud, the Purchaser's
exclusive remedy for any breach of a Seller's Warranty under this Agreement
shall be a claim for monetary damages, and no other remedy (including
rescission or specific performance) shall be available to the Purchaser.

| 
---|--- 

13.

|

Actuarial Matters 

The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Seller makes no express or
implied warranty hereby or otherwise under this Agreement as to the reserves
held by or on behalf of the Company, or that such reserves or assets
supporting such reserves have been or will be adequate or sufficient for the
purposes for which they were established, that the reinsurance receivables
taken into account in determining the amount of such reserves will be
collectible or, except as set forth in paragraph 3.4 of Schedule 3 of this
Agreement, whether such reserves were calculated, established or determined in

(iv)

|

in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 6 of this Schedule; 

|

conduct of any trade or business carried on by it or any increase in its
capital after Completion; 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

this Schedule, by the Purchaser, the Company or any other member of the
Purchaser\'s Group under the provisions of any enactment or regulation
relating to Tax, other than any claim, election, surrender, disclaimer, notice

details of the Claim for Tax) as soon as possible (and in any event not more
than 10 Business Days after the Purchaser or the Company becomes aware of the
Claim for Tax), provided always that the giving of such notice shall not be a
condition precedent to the liability of the Seller under this Schedule or for
breach of any of the Tax Warranties.

|

any claims, elections, surrenders, notices, consents, settlements or

the payee obtaining a Relief, the payee must pay to the payer, within 10
Business Days of the use or set off of the Relief, an amount equal to the
lesser of the Tax saved as a result of such use or set off and the additional
sum paid under clause 15 of the Agreement provided that the payee will not be
obliged to pay to the payer an amount in excess of the amount which will leave
it (after that payment) in the same after Tax position as it would have been
in had there been no payment under this Agreement in respect of which such
deduction or withholding arose.

the time being of the Company (at the request and expense of the Seller) have
certified that:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

a Liability for Tax which has resulted in a payment by the Seller to the
Purchaser under paragraph 2 of this Schedule or under the Tax Warranties and
such liability gives rise to a corresponding saving of Tax (other than a
corresponding saving which constitutes a Purchaser's Relief or which has been
taken into account in computing any liability of the Seller under the Tax
Warranties or this Schedule) (the "Saving") for the Company; or 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

a Company has received or obtained a Relief (other than a Relief which is a
repayment of Tax or a Purchaser's Relief) which has arisen: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

as a consequence of or by reference to any Event that occurred on or before
the Locked Box Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

in respect of any Income, Profits or Gains which were earned, accrued or
received on or before the Locked Box Date or in respect of a period ending on
or before the Locked Box Date; or 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

as a result of any Liability for Tax which has resulted in a payment's having
been made or becoming due from the Seller under paragraph 2 of this Schedule
or in respect of any Tax Warranty, or 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

any provision for Tax in the 2015 Accounts (excluding any provision in respect
of deferred Tax) shall be found to be an overprovision (the "Overprovision")
other than by reason of a Purchaser's Relief, and 

the Saving, Relief, or Overprovision has arisen and (in the case of a Saving
or Relief) has been utilised, then an amount equal to the amount by which the
liability to Tax of the Company (other than a liability which would have given
rise to a claim under this Tax Covenant) is reduced as a result of the
utilisation of the Saving, Relief or the amount of the Overprovision shall be
dealt with in accordance with paragraph 7.4.

7.3 Paragraph 7.2 shall not apply to the extent that the Saving, Relief or
Overprovision has arisen or has increased as a result of:

---|---

any change in legislation (including regulations); 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the publication of any practice or concession by a Tax Authority;

---|--- 

(a)

|

the Relevant Amount shall first be set off against any payment then due from
the Seller under paragraph 2 of this Schedule or in respect of any Tax
Warranty; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

to the extent that there is an excess, a refund shall be made to the Seller of
any previous payment or payments made by the Seller under paragraph 2 of this 

 

Schedule or in respect of any Tax Warranty and not previously refunded under
this paragraph 7.2, up to the amount of such excess. Such refund to be made
within 10 Business Days of the certification of the existence and amount of
such Relevant Amount; and

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

to the extent that there remains any excess, such excess shall be carried
forward and set against future payments due from the Seller under paragraph 2
of this Schedule or in respect of any Tax Warranty. 

7.5 If the auditors make an amendment to the earlier certificate and the
amount of the Saving, Relief or Overprovision is revised, that revised amount
shall be substituted for the previous amount and any adjusting payment
required shall be made by or to the Seller (as the case may be) as soon as
practicable to put the Seller in the same position it would have been in if
the Relevant Amount had always been the revised amount and not the amount
originally certified.

7.6 For the purposes of paragraph 7.2, no Saving or Relief shall be treated as
having arisen until it has been realised by the Company either by way of a
repayment of or by a reduction in Tax which would otherwise have become due
and payable, taking into account any other available Relief.

8. Repayments 

8.1 If, on or before the seventh anniversary of Completion, the Company has
received or obtained a repayment of Tax (other than a Purchaser's Relief)
which has arisen:

|

as a consequence of or by reference to any Event which occurred wholly on or
before the Locked Box Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

in respect of any Income, Profits or Gains which were wholly earned, accrued
or received on or before the Locked Box Date or wholly in respect of a period
ending on or before the Locked Box Date; or 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

as a result of any Liability for Tax which has resulted in a payment having
been made or becoming due from the Seller under paragraph 2 of this Schedule
or in respect of any Tax Warranty (which has not been taken into account in
computing any liability of the Seller under the Tax Warranties or this
Schedule), 

then an amount equal to that repayment (less any reasonable fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Purchaser or the Company in obtaining such repayment)
shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 8.3.

8.2 Paragraph 8.1 shall not apply to the extent that the repayment has arisen
or has increased as a result of:

(b)

|

the publication of any practice or concession by a Tax Authority;

forward and set against future payments due from the Seller under paragraph 2
of this Schedule or in respect of any Tax Warranty. 

9. Third party recovery

9.1 If the Seller shall have paid an amount in respect of any Tax under
paragraph 2.1 and, on or before the seventh anniversary of Completion, the
Company or the Purchaser is entitled to recover from some other person
(including a Tax Authority but excluding any member of the Purchaser's Group)
any sum in respect of the Tax that has resulted in that payment by the Seller
(and otherwise than by the utilisation of the whole or any part of any
Purchaser's Relief), the Purchaser shall (at the Seller's expense) take all
reasonable steps requested in writing by the Seller to secure such recovery
and shall keep the Seller informed of any progress.

9.2 Following any recovery under paragraph 2.1, the Purchaser shall pay to the
Seller, within 10 Business Days of the recovery, whichever is the lesser of:

Liability for Tax less any Tax chargeable on the amount of such recovery and
less any third party costs and expenses reasonably and properly incurred and
not previously recovered from the Seller under paragraph 9.2 and less the
amount of such recovery which has been taken into account in computing any
liability under the Tax Warranties or this Schedule; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the amount paid by the Seller under paragraph 2.1 in respect of that Liability
for Tax. 

9.3 If the provisions of paragraph 8 (Corresponding Savings and
Overprovisions) and this paragraph 9 (Third party recovery) would apply in
respect of a Saving, Relief or Overprovision or the provisions of paragraph 8
(Repayments) and this paragraph 9 (Third party recovery) would apply in
respect of a repayment of Tax, the provisions of paragraph 7 or paragraph 8 as
appropriate, and not the provisions of this paragraph 9, shall apply in
relation to it.

10. Counter covenant 

10.1 The Purchaser covenants with the Seller to pay to the Seller an amount
equal to any of the following:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

any liability or increased liability to Tax of any member of the Seller\'s
Group which arises solely as a result of or by reference to any reduction or
disallowance of Group Relief (other than Group Relief which has been treated
as an asset of a Group Company in preparing the 2015 Accounts or which is
taken into account in computing a provision for deferred Tax in the 2015
Accounts) that would otherwise have been available to that member of the
Seller\'s Group where and to the extent that such reduction or disallowance
occurs as a result of or by reference to any total or partial: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

voluntary withdrawal effected by the Company after Completion of any surrender
of Group Relief in respect of any accounting period ended on or before
Completion; or 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

voluntary withdrawal or alteration of any claim or election relating to any
Relief made by the Company after Completion in respect of any period ended on
or before Completion, 

save where any such withdrawal or alteration is made pursuant to the exercise
by the Seller of its rights under this Schedule or otherwise with the express
written consent of the Seller; or

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

any liability or increased liability to Tax of any member of the Seller\'s
Group which arises as a consequence of or by reference to a failure by a
Relevant Company to discharge a liability to Tax; 

and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), the term "Relevant Company" shall
mean any company which is, or has at any time been, treated for the purposes
of any Tax as being a member of the same group of companies as the Purchaser
or as being associated with the Purchaser; and

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

any reasonable out of pocket legal, accounting or other costs and expenses
reasonably and properly incurred by any member of the Seller\'s Group in

| 
---|---

|

(in the case of 10.1(b)) to the extent that the liability for the Tax arises
in circumstances such that the Purchaser would have been entitled to make a
claim against the Seller under paragraph 2.1 above in respect of that Tax had
it been paid by the Relevant Company (and ignoring the provisions of paragraph
2 of Schedule 4), except to the extent that a payment has already been made
pursuant to paragraph 2.1; or 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

to the extent that the Tax has been recovered under any relevant statutory
provision (and the Seller shall procure that no such recovery is sought to the
extent that payment is made hereunder). 

10.3 Paragraph 4 (Conduct of Claim for Tax) and paragraph 5 (Payment of
claims) shall apply to the covenants in paragraph 10.1 as if references to the
Purchaser were replaced with references to the Seller (and vice versa) where
appropriate and making any other necessary modifications.

11.1 Without prejudice to the rights of the Purchaser to make a claim under
this Schedule, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to any
payment of Corporation Tax which is required to be discharged by the Company
on behalf of any Seller Group Participating Company. Such payment (the
"Payment") shall be made in cleared funds 2 (two) Business Days before the due
date for payment to HMRC of the underlying corporation tax liability. If the
Seller fails to pay by such due date, it shall in addition pay interest on
such contribution at the rate payable from time to time to HMRC on underpaid
Corporation Tax during the period from such due date to the date on which the
Payment is received by the Purchaser.

11.2 No payment shall be made under paragraph 11.1 to the extent that the
Seller's Group has previously at any time, without cost to the Company,
satisfied the obligations under the Group Payment Arrangement.

11.3 The Purchaser shall:

---|--- 

(a)

|

procure that there shall be promptly paid to HMRC an amount equal to any
Payment following receipt of it, in the event that a Payment is made in
respect of a liability to corporation tax which has not been discharged; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

procure that there shall be promptly apportioned to the Seller Group
Participating Companies an amount equal to each Payment, such apportionment to
be made by reference to the payment of corporation tax in respect of which the
Payment was paid and the Purchaser shall not, without the Seller's written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), reapportion any amount previously
apportioned to the relevant Seller Group Participating Companies pursuant to
the Group Payment Arrangement; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

within 10 Business Days of receipt thereof from a Tax Authority, pay, or
procure that there is paid, to the Seller an amount equal to any excess by

Seller) an amount equivalent to such proportion of any repayment of VAT
received by the Company as the representative member from HMRC or of any
credit obtained by reference to an excess of deductible input tax over output

on or before Completion, procure that notice is given to HMRC (and supply a
copy of the notice to the Purchaser) that the Company will cease to be a
member of the UK VAT Group with effect on the day of Completion.

disregarded in determining for the purposes of paragraphs 12.1 and 12.2 what
supplies have been made or are deemed to have been made by or to any person.

12.5 The Purchaser shall procure that an amount equal to any payment made or
procured by the Seller under this paragraph shall be promptly and duly
accounted for to HMRC.
