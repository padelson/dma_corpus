ARTICLE 3

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a
result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company:

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Stock that is owned by the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of
its direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries will automatically be
cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will
be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) _Conversion of Company Stock_.

 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be cancelled and
retired in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_ and (ii) Dissenting Shares) will,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into the right to receive the following: (i) the
Company Common Stock Closing Consideration Per Share, and (ii) the right to
receive a portion of the Cash Consideration in accordance with the terms of
_Section 3.7_.

 

(ii) Each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be cancelled and
retired in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_ and (ii) Dissenting Shares) will,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into the right to receive the Company Preferred Stock
Closing Consideration Per Share.

 



21 (iii) At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock will no
longer be outstanding and all such shares of Company Stock will be cancelled
and retired and will cease to exist, and, subject to _Section 3.3_, each
holder of a certificate formerly representing any such shares (each, a "
_Company Certificate_ ") will cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
_Section 3.2_ hereof and, in the case of Company Common Stockholders, the
right to receive a portion of the Cash Consideration in accordance with the
terms of _Section 3.7_.

(c)  _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

3.2  _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall send to each record holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective
Time, a Letter of Transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Company Certificates to Parent) for use in such
exchange.

(b) Upon surrender by a Company Stockholder of all of his, her or its Company
Certificates to Parent together with a duly completed and validly executed
Letter of Transmittal, each such holder shall be entitled, following the
Effective Time, to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Number of Parent Shares Per Holder for such holder plus the right to
receive a portion of the Cash Consideration in accordance with the terms of
_Section 3.7_. Until so surrendered and subject to the terms set forth in
_Section 3.3_, each such Company Certificate shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the shares of Parent
Common Stock payable in respect thereof plus the right to receive a portion
of the Cash Consideration in accordance with the terms of _Section 3.7_.

(c) All consideration paid upon the surrender of Company Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Stock formerly
represented by such Company Certificate, and from and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company
Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the
Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the shares
of Parent Common Stock plus the right to receive a portion of the Cash
Consideration in accordance with the terms of _Section 3.7_ provided for, and
in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article 3_.

(d) Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for
any consideration paid to a Governmental Authority pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Stock two (2) years after the Effective Time
(or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall
automatically become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property
of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



22 (e) The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to this _Article 3_ will be issued in a
transaction exempt from registration under (i) the Securities Act, by reason
of Section 4(2) thereof and Rule 506 of Regulation D thereunder, and (ii)
applicable state securities Laws. Such shares will not, at the Effective
Time, have been registered under the Securities Act or any applicable state
securities Laws, and no such shares may be sold or otherwise transferred
unless (i) the sale or other transfer of such shares is registered under the
Securities Act, (ii) the holder of such shares delivers to Parent an opinion
of counsel, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and its
counsel, to the effect that such shares have been sold or otherwise
transferred pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and applicable state securities Laws, or (iii) the holder of
such shares provides Parent and its counsel with reasonable assurance, as
set forth in customary written documentation executed by such holder and its
broker, that such shares have been sold or otherwise transferred pursuant to
Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or a successor rule thereto). The shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued to the Company Stockholders pursuant to this
_Article 3_ shall be represented by stock certificates that are countersigned
by the transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock and bear a restrictive
legend (and are subject to stop-transfer instructions) consistent with the
foregoing.

(f) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued. Any holder of Company Stock who would otherwise be entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall,
in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holders
Company Certificate(s), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the
nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying (i) such
fraction, _by_ (ii) the Closing Share Value.

 

3.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, including _Section 3.1_, shares of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_) and held by a holder who has
not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in
accordance with the DGCL (such shares of Company Stock being referred to
collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such
holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights
under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a
right to receive the shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this
_Article 3_ , but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are
granted by the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holders right to
appraisal pursuant to the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by the DGCL,
such shares of Company Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with this _Article 3_ , without interest thereon, upon
surrender of such

 



23  Certificate formerly representing such shares. The Company shall provide
Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and
any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent
shall have the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 

3.4 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article 3_ such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or the treasury regulations thereunder, or
any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted, withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Authority by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding

 

3.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed (such
making of an affidavit, if applicable, to be deemed delivery of such Persons
Company Certificate for purposes of this _Article 3_ ), Parent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in respect of the shares of Company Stock
formerly represented by such Company Certificate as contemplated under this 
_Article 3_.

3.6 _Treatment of Company Options_. It is the understanding of the parties
hereto that James Bond will exercise some or all of his vested Company
Options prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall take all requisite
action so that, at the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of that Company Option or
any other Person, cancelled and of no further force or effect. At or prior to
the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the compensation
committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions (including obtaining any consents) that may be necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.6_.

3.7 _Cash Consideration_. Promptly, and, in any case, no later than the third
(3rd) Business Day following the Cash Consideration Due Date, Parent shall
pay each Company Common Stockholder an amount equal to such Company Common
Stockholders Pro Rata Share of the following amount (the " _Cash
Consideration_ "):

 

(a) the Base Cash Amount; _plus_

 

(b) the amount (if any) by which the actual Combined Net Debt and Working
Capital of the Target Companies as of the Effective Time is less than the
Lower Indemnification Threshold (" _Additional Cash Consideration_ "); _plus_

 



24 (c) the lesser of (i) the amount of Tax refunds the Company has actually
received after the Effective Time and before the third (3rd) Business Day
following the Cash Consideration Due Date on account of the Income Tax
receivable recorded on the Financial Statements in the amount of $5,789,000
(net of reasonable costs incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in connection
with realizing such Tax refunds), and (ii) the amount paid to Parent by the
Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ with respect to Indemnified
Item #1 on the Company Indemnified Items Schedule; _plus_

(d) any refund of Tax of any of the Target Companies actually received after
the Effective Time and before the third (3rd) Business Day following the Cash
Consideration Due Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (net of
reasonable costs incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with
realizing such Tax refund and net of any Tax imposed on Parent or any of its
Affiliates for any Tax period in connection with such Tax refund or the
circumstances giving rise to such Tax refund), except to the extent that (i)
such refund was taken into account in the determination of Company Net
Working Capital as of the Effective Time or is included in the Income Tax
receivable recorded on the Financial Statements in the amount of $5,789,000,
(ii) such refund is attributable to the carryback of a Tax attribute arising
in a period other than a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_
" ), or (iii) the portion of any refund of Taxes with respect to a Straddle
Period of a Target Company apportioned to the Post-Closing Tax Period in the
manner described in _Section 6.10(c)_; _minus_

 

(e) any amounts owed or claimed to be owed (the aggregate amount claimed to be
owed, the " _Claimed Amount_ ") to Parent by the Company Stockholders in
accordance with _Article 9_ , net of the aggregate amount of Replenishments
made by the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 9.7(c)(iii)_.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that after the payment of the Cash
Consideration it is finally determined that Parent is not entitled to the
Claimed Amount or any portion thereof, the Cash Consideration amount shall be
recalculated and to the extent that such recalculated amount exceeds the
previously paid amount of Cash Consideration, such excess shall be paid
by Parent to the Company Common Stockholders, no later than the tenth (10th)
Business Day following such determination, in the manner provided in this
_Section 3.7_. Any payments made by Parent to a Company Common Stockholder
pursuant to this  _Section 3.7_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the applicable Company
Common Stockholder.

3.8 _Closing Schedules_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a closing schedule, which
shall be certified by the Companys chief financial officer, in the form of
_Exhibit C_ (the " _Company Closing Schedule_ ") setting forth: (i) a list of
all Company Stockholders and Company Optionholders as of such time; (ii) the
number of shares of Company Stock and Company Options held by each of the
Company Stockholders and Company Optionholders as of such time (assuming for
purposes of this calculation that James Bond has exercised the Company Options
held by him in full on a cashless exercise basis); (iii) the Number of Parent
Shares Per Holder for each Company Stockholder; (iv) the cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid to each Company
Stockholder, (v) the Companys good faith estimate of the Company Net Debt as
of the Effective Time; (vi) the Companys estimated consolidated balance sheet
of the Target Companies as of the Effective Time

 



25  and the Companys corresponding good faith estimate of the Company Net
Working Capital as of the Effective Time; and (vii) the indirect relative
ownership of the outstanding shares of Company Stock by the equity owners of
the Holding Vehicles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, for purposes of the Company Closing Schedule and the various items set
forth therein, it shall be assumed that James Bond has exercised the Company
Options held by him in full on a cashless exercise basis.

3.9 _Tax Consequences_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger
shall be treated as may be reasonably determined by Parent, and the Parties
hereto agree to not take any position on any Tax Return or in the course of
any audit or examination inconsistent with such treatment, except upon a
final determination of the applicable Taxing authority.

Financing Letter is in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement

are the only agreements that have been entered into by Parent with respect to
the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Financing Letter has
not been amended or modified, (ii) no such amendments or modifications are
contemplated, (iii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of any of the
terms or conditions set forth therein, and (iv) the obligations and

this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent
and/or Merger Sub under any term or condition of the Financing Letter. There
are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to the funding of the
Financing other than as set forth in the Financing Letter. Assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Article 4_ of this Agreement and the Companys compliance with its covenants

that the Financing will not be available to Parent and/or Merger Sub on the
Closing Date.

 



56 5.10 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming satisfaction of the
conditions to the obligation of the Company to consummate the Merger, or
waiver of such conditions, and after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Financing, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent. For the purposes of this _Section 5.10_ the
term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any
date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all
"liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities", as
of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with
applicable federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of
debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent
liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured, (b) such Person will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged
following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of
this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof,
to meet its obligations as they become due.

5.11 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Parent Board has received an opinion
from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated to the effect that, as
of the date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and
limitations set forth in such opinion, the consideration to be paid by Parent
in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent.

5.12 _Litigation_. Except as set forth in  _Section 5.12(a)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, there is no suit, action, claim, proceeding, investigation,
arbitration or mediation pending or, to the Parents Knowledge, threatened
against Parent or any of its current or former officers, directors or
employees (with respect to their service as an officer, director or employee
of Parent) except for any such matters involving solely a claim of monetary
damages of less than $100,000, individually. _Section 5.12(b)_ of the Parent

mediations made, filed or otherwise initiated in connection with Parent and
resolved during the three (3) years immediately preceding the date of this
Agreement, except for matters covered by insurance with an amount ultimately
paid out by Parent less than $100,000 and no other remedy. Except as set forth

to any judgment, award, order or decree providing for monetary payments in
excess of $10,000, individually. Except as set forth in _Section 5.12(d)_ of
the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent is not engaged in any suit, action,
claim, proceeding, arbitration or mediation to recover monies due it or for
damages sustained by it in excess of $10,000, individually.

Letter, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default in any

Parent shall take reasonable measures to ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Parent Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance
with applicable Laws. The written consent of the Company shall be required to
adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , that in any
case Parent may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting if
Parent reasonably determines, following consultation with its legal counsel,
that failure to do so is necessary to avoid a breach of applicable Law, in
which case, Parent will hold or resume the Parent Stockholders Meeting on
the earliest date thereafter on which the Parent Stockholders Meeting could
be held or resumed without breaching applicable Law.

 

(b) Parent agrees that, subject to _Section 6.7(c)_: (i) the Parent Board
shall unanimously recommend that the Parent Stockholders vote to approve the
Parent Stockholder Approval Matter and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit such approval within the timeframe set forth in _Section
6.7(a)_ above; (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the
effect that the Parent Board unanimously recommends that the Parent
Stockholders vote to approve the Parent Stockholder Approval Matter (the
unanimous recommendation of the Parent Board that the Parent
Stockholders vote to approve the Parent Stockholder Approval Matter being
referred to as the " _Parent Board Recommendation_ "); and (iii) the Parent
Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
the Company, and no resolution by the Parent Board or any committee thereof
to withdraw or modify the Parent Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to
the Company shall be adopted or proposed.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.7(b)_,
at any time prior to the approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger by the Parent Stockholders pursuant to the Required Parent
Stockholder Vote, the Parent Board may withhold, amend, withdraw or modify the
Parent Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the Company if, but only
if, the Parent Board determines in good faith, based on such matters as it
deems relevant following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify such recommendation
would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws (a "
_Change in Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , that the Company receives written
notice from Parent confirming that the Parent Board has determined to change
its recommendation at least two (2) Business Days in advance of the Parent
Board Recommendation being withdrawn, withheld, amended or modified in a
manner adverse to the Company.

 

(d) Parents obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Parent
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with  _Section 6.7(a)_ shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by any withdrawal or modification of the Parent
Board Recommendation.

6.10 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Tax Returns_.

(i) Parent shall, at Parents expense, prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Target Companies (i) for all
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are filed after the
Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns_ ") and (ii) for all Straddle
Periods (" _Straddle Period Tax Returns_ " and together with the Pre-Closing
Period Tax Returns, the " _Covered Tax Returns_ "). Such Pre-Closing Period
Tax Returns shall be prepared, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on
a basis consistent with the Tax Returns previously filed by the Target
Companies and the Target Companies Tax and accounting policies. Parent shall
provide a copy of any Covered Tax Return that relates to Income Taxes or
involves a Tax liability in excess of $10,000 (a " _Material Covered Tax
Return_ ") to the Stockholders Representative (and, in the case of a Material
Covered Tax Return relating to a Straddle Period, a sufficiently detailed
statement certifying the amount of any Taxes attributable to the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date reflected on such Straddle
Period Tax Return (the " _Tax Statement_ ")) for review and comment, at least
20 days prior to the due date (including all applicable extensions) for filing
the applicable Material Covered Tax Return, except for any such Material
Covered Tax Return that is due (including all 

 



74  applicable extensions) within 60 days after the Closing, which shall be
provided within a reasonable time after the filing thereof; and except that
for any Material Covered Tax Return that does not relate to Income Tax that
the Parent is unable to deliver to the Stockholders Representative at the
applicable time described in this _Section 6.10(a)_, after undertaking
commercially reasonable efforts to do so, Parent shall not be required to
provide the Stockholders Representative with a copy of such Material Covered
Tax Return before filing, and shall provide such a copy (together with the Tax
Statement, as applicable) within reasonable time after the filing of such
Material Covered Tax Return. Upon request, Parent shall make reasonable
efforts to deliver to the Stockholders Representative, as reasonably
practicable, copies of any relevant supporting schedules, work papers and
other documentation that, in each case, are reasonably requested by the
Stockholders Representative. Parent shall consider in good faith any comments
delivered by the Stockholders Representative at least ten (10) days prior to
the due date for filing the applicable Material Covered Tax Return (but not
later than thirty (30) days after receipt by the Stockholders Representative
of a copy of the applicable Material Covered Tax Return or Tax Statement, as
applicable). Parent and the Stockholders Representative agree to consult and
to attempt to resolve in good faith any disputes with respect to any comments
timely made by the Stockholders Representative with respect to a Pre-Closing
Material Tax Return or Tax Statement prior to the due date (including all
applicable extensions) for the filing of the applicable Material Covered Tax
Return. If Parent and the Stockholders Representative cannot resolve any
dispute relating to a Material Covered Tax Return (including any Material
Covered Tax Return delivered to the Stockholders Representative after the
filing of such return), the matter shall be promptly referred to the
Accounting Firm for resolution in accordance with  _Section 6.10(i)_,
provided, however, that to the extent that the Accounting Firm does not
resolve the dispute for any reason at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
due date for filing the applicable Tax Return, Parent (or its Affiliate, as
applicable) shall be entitled to file such Tax Return based on its discretion,
and, to the extent necessary and permitted by applicable Tax law, shall file
an amended Tax Return following the resolution of dispute by the
Accounting Firm in accordance with such resolution. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that the number of days in the period commencing
immediately after the close of the applicable reporting period (or, if later,
the Closing Date) and ending on the due date (including all applicable
extensions) for filing the applicable Material Covered Tax Return is less than
sixty (60) days, the numbers twenty (20), ten (10) and thirty (30) in this
_Section 6.10(a)_ above shall be reduced in the same proportion that such
number of days in the period bears to sixty (60) days (and be rounded
downwards).

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.10(a)_ and
_Section 6.10(i)_, Parent shall not be required to consider or agree to, and
no dispute shall be deemed to exist (including for purposes of _Section
6.10(i)_ hereof) with respect to, any comment of the Stockholders
Representative relating to any amount, form, statement or other item included
in such Material Covered Tax Return that may not result in an indemnification
obligation of the Company Stockholders for Taxes under

 



75  this Agreement, provided that Parent timely delivers a written statement to
the Stockholders Representative stating (in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Stockholders Representative) that such items may not result in an
indemnification obligation of the Company Stockholders for Taxes under this
Agreement and affirmatively waiving any right for indemnification with respect
to such items. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or otherwise (including _Section 6.10_), the nonfulfillment or a
breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent under this _Section
6.10(a)_ shall not affect the Company Stockholders indemnification
responsibilities under this Agreement except to the extent that the Company
Stockholders have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

(iii) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of the Target Companies to timely prepare, and make commercially reasonable
efforts to complete before the Closing the preparation of, in each case in
accordance with past practice, all Tax Returns that are due (including all
applicable extensions) within ninety (90) days after the Closing, and, upon
Parents request, permit Parent to review and comment on each such Tax Return.

(b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on
the one hand, and the Stockholders Representative, on the other hand, shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon request) the provision of records and
information which may be reasonably relevant to any such Tax audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making appropriate persons available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent
to the Target Companies relating to any Tax period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified, any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax periods, and
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax authority,
(ii) deliver or make available to Parent on the Closing Date, originals or
accurate copies of all such books and records, and (iii) give Parent or the
Stockholders Representative, as the case may be, reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Stockholders Representative
so requests, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Stockholders
Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the requesting party to take
possession of such books and records at such requesting partys expense.
Parent and the Stockholders Representative further agree, upon request and at
the requesting partys expense, to use their commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental authority
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby). The Parties further agree, upon request, to provide
each other Party with all information that such other Party may be required
to report pursuant to Code §6043, or Code §6043A, or Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Upon request, each Company Stockholder shall promptly
deliver to Parent a completed and duly executed IRS Form W-8 or W-9, as
applicable (or any successor form).

 



76 (c) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), (i) the amount
of any Taxes based on or measured by income, net income, receipts, payroll,
profits or similar items of any of the Target Companies for the period ending
on the Closing Date, shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which
any of the Target Companies holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to
terminate at such time) and (ii) the amount of any other Taxes of any of the
Target Companies for a Straddle Period that relates to the period ending on
the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in each case the Taxes allocated to the period of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall not include any Taxes
occurring on the Closing Date but after the Effective Time that are
attributable to any actions or activities other than in the ordinary course
of business of the Target Companies occurring on the Closing Date but after
the Effective Time (other than solely as a result of the Merger).

 

(d) _Tax-Sharing Agreements_. All tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements
with respect to or involving any of the Target Companies shall be terminated
as of the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, none of the Target
Companies shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

(e) _Transfer Tax_. All transfer, documentary, stamp, registration, sales, use
and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and similar
fees and charges, including any penalties and interest imposed thereon ("
_Transfer Tax_ "), incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by the
Company Stockholders when due, and the Company Stockholders will, at their own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and such other documentation with
respect to such Transfer Taxes (" _Transfer Tax Returns_ ") and, if required
by applicable Law, Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to) join in the
execution of any such Transfer Tax Returns. 

(f) _Amendments of Tax Returns_. After the Closing Date, neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates shall amend, modify or otherwise change any Covered Tax
Return (or other Tax Return filed on or before the Closing Date) filed by or
on behalf of the Target Companies to the extent that such amendment would
result in an indemnification obligation of the Company Stockholders for Taxes
under _Sections 9.1_ of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by
applicable law or any Tax authority or unless advised by the Parents
accounting firm to correct an error in the applicable Covered Tax
Return, without the prior written consent of the Stockholders
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. The provisions set forth in _Section 6.10(a)_ above with respect
to Material Covered Tax Returns relating to Income Taxes shall apply (with
necessary modifications) with respect to the filing by Parent or any of its
Affiliates of any amended Covered Tax Return (or other Tax Return filed on or
before the Closing Date).

 



77 (g) _Tax Proceedings_. This _Section 6.10(g)_ (and not  _Section 9.4_)
shall apply to any Third Party Claim relating to Tax Proceedings (as defined
below). After the Closing, Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholders
Representative in writing of the proposed assessment or the commencement of
any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or
claim which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of
time, could be grounds for payment of indemnification for Taxes by the
Company Stockholders under this Agreement (" _Tax Proceeding_ "), _provided_
, _however_ , that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Company
Stockholders have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Such
notice shall contain factual information describing the asserted Tax liability
in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document
received from any Governmental Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax
liability. Parent shall have the right to control the conduct of such Tax
Proceeding, provided that (i) Parent shall keep the Stockholders
Representative informed on a timely basis with respect to any applicable
developments relating to such Tax Proceedings (including the delivery of
copies of any correspondence with the applicable Governmental Authority) and
shall timely provide the Stockholders Representative with any
other materials relating to such Tax Proceedings that are reasonably
requested by the Stockholders Representative, (ii) the Stockholders
Representative shall have the right to participate in (but not control), at
its sole cost and expense, any such Tax Proceeding to the extent relating to
a Pre-Closing Period Tax Return of the Target Companies (including, the right
to attend meetings and review and comment on submissions relating to any such
Tax Proceeding), (iii) Parent shall consider in good faith any comments
provided by the Stockholders Representative with respect to any Tax
Proceeding, and (iv) neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates may settle or
compromise any Tax Proceeding that may result in an indemnification
obligation of the Company Stockholders for Taxes under this Agreement without
prior written consent of the Stockholders Representative, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(h) _Limitations on Indemnity_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or otherwise, the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to be indemnified or held harmless under this Agreement
(including pursuant to a claim of breach of representation) for, and the
Company Stockholders shall not be responsible for (including under  _Section
9.1(d)(i)_) any Taxes to the extent (i) attributable to transactions or
actions by Parent or its Subsidiaries outside of the ordinary course of
business that occur on the Closing Date but after the Effective Time (other
than solely as a result of the Merger) or (ii) resulting from the
nonfulfillment or a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent
under this _Section 6.10_ or any other portion of this Agreement.

 

(i) _Tax Disputes_. This _Section 6.10(i)_ and not _Section 10.12_ shall
govern any disputes related to matters that are governed by _Section
6.10(a)_ or _Section 6.10(f)_. The Stockholders Representative, Parent and
their respective Affiliates shall try in good faith to resolve any dispute
related to matters that are governed by  _Section 6.10(a)_ or _Section
6.10(f)_ in a timely manner. In the event that

 



78  the Stockholders Representative and Parent are unable to resolve in good
faith any matter that is governed by _Section 6.10(a)_ or Section 6.10(f) in
a timely manner, the item in dispute shall be submitted immediately to a tax
partner in a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized independent accounting
firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution within ten (10) Business Days
after such dispute has been referred to it, but, in any event, not later than
at least two Business Days prior to the due date (including applicable
extensions) of the applicable Covered Tax Return. The Stockholders
Representative and Parent shall each be afforded an opportunity to present to
the Accounting Firm any material relating to the determination of the matters
in dispute and to discuss such matters with the Accounting Firm. The
determination by the Accounting Firm with respect to the matters submitted to
it under this _Section 6.10(i)_ shall be binding and conclusive on the
parties. The fees and expenses of such Accounting Firm related to resolution
of such disputes shall be split equally between the Company Stockholders,
on one hand, and Parent, on the other hand.

(j) _Section 338_. No election under Code Section 338, or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law, may be made with respect to
the Merger, without prior written consent of the Stockholders Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it
being understood that any such election, if made by Parent, shall not give
rise to any indemnity obligation of the Company Stockholders under this
Agreement).

(k) _Tax Refunds_. After the Closing, Parent shall make reasonable efforts,
but shall not be required to initiate any Tax proceedings or, subject to the
foregoing, file any Tax Return, to collect the Tax refunds that may be owed
to the Target Companies and included in the Income Tax receivable recorded on
the Financial Statements in the amount of $5,789,000 or the Covered Refunds.
Upon reasonable request by the Stockholders Representative, and at the
Company Stockholders sole expense, with respect to any Tax period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall make reasonable efforts to cause
the Target Companies to prepare and file any Tax return or claim for a
Tax refund, or prepare and file an amended Tax return claiming a Tax refund,
to the extent that such filing is necessary to realize any Tax refund included
within the Covered Refunds, provided that Parent determines, based on its
reasonable discretion, that (i) such action would not result in adverse Tax
consequences to Parent or any Affiliate thereof (including the Target
Companies) in any Tax period or a portion thereof, (ii) such action would be
supported by applicable Law and the positions taken on such Tax return are
"more likely than not", based on technical merits, to be sustained upon
examination, (iii) such action will not impose an undue burden on Parent or
any of its Affiliates (or is likely to give rise to a Tax audit), and (iv)
Stockholders Representatives has either paid in advance to Parent the cost
associated with such action or made other arrangements with Parent for the
payment of such cost (satisfactory to Parent upon its reasonable discretion).
If, subsequent to a Governmental Authoritys allowance of a Tax refund, such
Governmental Authority reduces or denies any such Tax refund, such Tax refund
or the relevant portion thereof previously taken into account pursuant to
_Section 3.7_ in calculating Cash Consideration shall be paid by the Company
Stockholders, promptly upon request, to Parent.

 



79 ---|--- 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the " _D andO
Insurance_") (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies with reputable and financially sound carriers with credit ratings not
lower than the Companys existing carrier) in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing Date, covering each person currently covered by
the DandO Insurance (a correct and complete copy of which DandO Insurance has been
heretofore provided to Parent), on terms with respect to the coverage,
deductible and amounts no less favorable than those of the DandO Insurance in
effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend in the aggregate pursuant to this
_Section 6.11(a)_ an annual amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in lieu of maintaining the current policies of DandO Insurance,
Parent may purchase "tail" coverage with a scope, policy limits and retained
coverage not less favorable than the scope, policy limits and retained
coverage currently provided.

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall include and
maintain in effect in its Organizational Documents for a period of six years
after the Closing Date, provisions regarding the elimination of liability of
directors (or their equivalent), indemnification of officers and directors
thereof and advancement of expenses which are, with respect to each
such entity, no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions contained in such Organizational Documents as of the
date of this Agreement.

---|--- 
 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent and the Nominating and Governance Committee

without any further action by Parent or the Parent Board (i) the Parent Board

(3) individuals designated by the Stockholders Representative, as soon as
reasonably possible after the date hereof and in any event at least sixty
(60) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, from the list of potential

provided herein, being referred to herein as a " _Board Designee_ " and
collectively as the " _Board Designees_ ") become members of the
Parent Board, filling the vacancies created by the increase in the size of
the Parent Board.

to the Parent Board of, and (iii) solicit proxies in favor of the election of,
any Board Designee whose term of office expires at such stockholder meeting
(or, in the discretion of the Stockholders Representative, such replacements
thereof or successors thereto designated by the Stockholders Representative)
to the Parent Board; _provided_ , that any such replacement or successor
designated by the Stockholders Representative (as well as any individual
designated by the Stockholders Representative pursuant to _Section 6.12(a)_)
must (i) meet Parents director qualification standards generally applicable
to its non-employee directors and (ii) be an independent director of Parent
under (A) the bylaws of Parent or any applicable corporate governance policies
or guidelines of Parent then in effect and (B) NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, in
each case as determined in good faith by the Parent Board.

(c) The number of Board Designees that the Stockholders Representative shall
be entitled to designate in connection with the nomination, appointment or
election of directors shall equal (i) three (3) so long as the Company
Stockholders collectively own of record and beneficially greater than or equal
to 5,444,678 shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) two (2) so long as the
Company Stockholders collectively own of record and beneficially greater than
or equal to 4,355,742 shares of Parent Common Stock and less than 5,444,678
shares of Parent Common Stock, (iii) one (1) so long as the Company
Stockholders collectively own of record and beneficially greater than or
equal to 2,177,871 shares of Parent Common Stock and less than 4,355,742
shares of Parent Common Stock, and (iv) none if the Company Stockholders
collectively own of record and beneficially less than 2,177,871 shares of
Parent Common Stock (in each case adjusted for stock splits, combinations or
other similar transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Board
shall in no event be obligated pursuant to this _Section 6.12_ to nominate,
appoint or elect a number of Board Designees in excess of the product of the
total number of directors on the Parent Board, multiplied by the percentage
that the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock then owned of
record and beneficially by the Company Stockholders collectively, represents
of the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock then outstanding, rounded
up to the nearest whole number of directors. If, as a result of the
immediately preceding sentence, the Parent Board is entitled, and intends, to
nominate, appoint or elect less than all of the Board Designees at a
particular time, the Stockholders Representative shall determine which of
such Board Designees shall no longer constitute Board Designees;  _provided_
, that for purposes of clarification, if at any point the Company Stockholders
are entitled to designate less than the number of Board Designees then serving
as directors on the Parent Board, all Board Designees then serving
as directors shall be permitted to remain on the Parent Board until the next
annual meeting of the Parent Stockholders or special meeting of the Parent
Stockholders at which directors of the Parent Board are to be elected.

 

(d) Promptly following the request of the Parent Board or the Nominating and
Governance Committee thereof (which request shall, in the case of any
individual designated by the Stockholders\' Representative pursuant to
_Section 6.12(a)_, be deemed to have been made immediately upon such
designation), any individual designated by Stockholders Representative for

 



81  election (including pursuant to _Section 6.12(a)_) as a director shall (i)
furnish (A) a completed director and officer questionnaire with respect to the
background and qualifications of such person, substantially in the form
provided to and requested to be completed by the then current members of the
Parent Board, and (B) such nominees consent to Parents engaging in a
background check of such nominee (including through a third party
investigation firm), and information reasonably necessary to complete such a
background check, in a manner consistent with background checks customarily
engaged in by Parent for prospective new members of the Parent Board, and
(ii) make himself or herself available for interviews by the Parent Board
(and/or the Nominating and Governance Committee thereof). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.12_, in the event that the
Parent Board determines in good faith, after consideration by the Nominating
and Governance Committee of the Parent Board and consultation with outside
legal counsel, that its nomination, appointment or election of a particular
Board Designee (including a Board Designee designated by the Stockholders
Representative from the list of potential candidates set forth on _Schedule D_
pursuant to _Section 6.12(a)_) would constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the Parent Stockholders (provided that any such determination with
respect to any individual designated by the Stockholders\' Representative
pursuant to _Section 6.12(a)_ shall be made no later than forty-five (45)
days after the individual\'s compliance with the first sentence of this
_Section 6.12(d)_), then the Parent Board shall inform the Stockholders
Representative of such determination in writing and explain in reasonable
detail the basis for such determination and shall nominate another individual
designated for nomination, election or appointment to the Parent Board by the
Stockholders Representative (subject in each case to this _Section 6.12(d)_)
and the Parent Board and Parent shall take all of the actions required by
this _Section 6.12_ with respect to the election at such stockholder meeting
of such substitute Board Designee. It is hereby acknowledged and agreed that
the fact that a particular Board Designee is an affiliate, director,
professional or agent of any Company Stockholders, or of any of its
Affiliates, shall not in and of itself constitute an acceptable basis for such
a determination by Parent Board.

 

(e) In the event that at any time there is a vacancy on the Parent Board
resulting from retirement, resignation or other termination of service for
any reason of a Board Designee, Parent shall (subject to _Section 6.12(d)_)
promptly fill such vacancy (for the remainder of the then current term) with
an individual designated by the Stockholders Representative; _provided_ ,
that such individual shall be subject to the requirements of replacement or
successor Board Designees set forth in _Section 6.12(b)_.

 

(f) Any Board Designee shall be subject to applicable confidentiality
requirements and other policies of Parent generally applicable to members of
the Parent Board (including Parents insider trading and disclosure policies)
as in effect from time to time, at any time while he or she is on the Parent
Board to the same extent as the other directors on the Parent Board.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Stockholders Representative shall not designate a Board Designee that is an
affiliate, director, employee, professional or agent of a Company Stockholder
or of any Affiliate of a Company Stockholder that is not, following the
Effective Time, bound by the non-competition and non-solicitation of clients
and customers covenants contained in _Sections 6.01(a)_ and _6.01(c)_ of a
Closing Agreement.

 



82 6.13 _Financing_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall provide, and shall cause
the Target Companies to provide, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause their respective representatives, including legal and

cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Target Companies), including (i) participation in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with
rating agencies, (ii) preparing and providing access to due diligence
materials reasonably required in connection with the Financing, (iii)
assisting with the preparation of materials for offering documents, private

reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor,
(iv) at Closing executing and delivering any pledge and security
documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates or

matters as of the Effective Time and consents of accountants for use of their
reports in any materials relating to the Financing), (v) reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral at Closing, (vi) furnishing Parent and
its Financing sources (the " _Financing Sources_ ") as promptly as
practicable with such financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Target Companies as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including all
financial statements and financial data of type and form customarily included
in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act to consummate the
offerings of debt securities contemplated by the Financing Letter at the time
during the Companys fiscal year such offerings will be made, (vii) providing
assistance to Parent and Merger Sub as they may reasonably request in
connection with the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Financing
Letter, (viii) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain accountants
comfort letters, as reasonably requested by Parent, (ix) using commercially

so requested by Parent, in order to develop alternative means of recording 

 



83 the Merger as a recapitalization for financial reporting purposes in
accordance with GAAP and (xii) taking all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of
the Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that the Target Companies shall not be required to approve or execute any
agreements, certificates or other documents relating to the Financing prior to
the Effective Time.

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Letter, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto
on the terms and conditions contained therein or on other terms no less
favorable to Parent and/or Merger Sub, (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent and/or Merger Sub in such definitive
agreements that are within their control, (iii) to comply with its
obligations under the Financing Letter, and (iv) to enforce its rights under
the Financing Letter (provided that the foregoing shall not obligate Parent to
bring, or threaten to bring, a claim, action or lawsuit against any of the
Financing Sources). Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming
aware of any material breach by any party of the Financing Letter or any
termination of the Financing Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on
a reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall not amend, modify or change
any of the conditions in the Financing Letter in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing without the
prior written consent of the Company. Subject to the satisfaction of all the
conditions to the Closing set forth in this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub
shall draw down on the financing referred to in the Financing Letter when the
conditions set forth in the Financing Letter are satisfied. In the event any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Financing Letter (as determined in the reasonable judgment
of Parent and Merger Sub), Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, notify the Company and Parent and Merger Sub shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources on terms no less favorable to Parent and/or Merger
Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event of unavailability. Parent
shall keep the Company reasonably apprised of material developments
relating to the Financing. The Financing Letter and any related fee letter
may only be amended, modified, supplemented, restated or superseded after the
date hereof but prior to the Effective Time without the prior written consent
of the Company if the terms and conditions after giving effect thereto shall
not (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, (y) expand upon the
conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Financing Letter and
any related fee letter in any respect that would reasonably be expected to
make such conditions less likely to be satisfied, or (z) reasonably be
expected to delay the Closing.

(c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Target
Companies obtained by Parent or its representatives pursuant to this _Section
6.13_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and its representatives shall
be permitted to disclose information as necessary and consistent with
customary practices in connection with the Financing upon the prior written
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



84 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a)
the Target Companies, the Company Stockholders, the Stockholders
Representative and their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders shall
not have any rights or claims against any Financing Source, in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have

out of or relating in any way to the Financing Letter or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise and (b) no Financing Source shall have any
liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any of the Target

working papers and its other materials which provide evidence of the basis
for the Propco Taxes Estimate (together " _Propco Information_ "), (ii) its
employees involved in the preparation of the Propco Taxes Estimate, and (iii)
its external accounting or tax advisors and counsels who have reviewed or
been involved in the preparation of the Propco Taxes Estimate. Specifically,
the Company shall provide Parent and its external accounting and tax advisors

tax advisors and counsels to review Exhibit H and the materials provided by
Company in accordance with the foregoing, in order to determine whether or not
Parent disputes any tax position used to calculate, or the calculation of, the

pursuant to a "more likely than not" standard (the " _Review Standard_ "). If,
consistent with the Review Standard, Parents external accounting firm,
tax advisor or counsel advises Parent that the Propco Taxes Estimate does not
comport with the Review Standard in all respects, then Parent shall be
permitted to provide written notice to the Company stating that it disputes
the Propco Taxes Estimate, which such notice shall state, in reasonable
detail, the tax positions in dispute and Parents calculation of the Propco
Taxes Estimate (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). Parent must deliver a Dispute
Notice no later than 30 calendar days after the Materials Delivery Date. If
Parent timely delivers a Dispute Notice to the Company, then the Company and
Parent shall use reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within 5 days of
the delivery of such Dispute Notice. If the parties are unable to resolve
such dispute within such time period, the dispute shall be resolved in the
manner set forth in _Section 6.10(i)_; _provided_ that the parties shall
instruct the Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute using the Review
Standard no later than 30 days after submission of the dispute to the
Accounting Firm and in any event prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the

position as to any portion of the dispute if the Company obtains and delivers
to Parent, at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing, a tax opinion from
KPMG LLP (or another "big four" accounting firm acceptable to Parent (acting
reasonably)) to the effect that the Companys position as to such portion of
the dispute meets the Review Standard in all respects as to such portion of
the dispute. If the Company is unable to deliver such a tax opinion and if the
dispute is not resolved before the Closing by the Accounting Firm, then the
Company shall be permitted, (a) no later than 4 Business Days prior to the
Closing, to make an estimated tax payment to the applicable Tax authorities in
the amount of Propco Taxes determined by Parent to be due (in which case, the
Company shall promptly forward to Parent an official receipt (or a certified
copy), or other documentation reasonably requested by Parent, evidencing such
payment to such Tax authorities), or, at the Companys election, (b) place
such amount into the escrow contemplated by _Section 7.2(l)_ pending
resolution of such dispute. Upon the resolution of such dispute, the amounts
held in escrow shall be distributed to the Company, and, if such resolution
occurs after the Closing, the portion of the deposited funds determined by the
resolution of the dispute to be in excess of the Propco Taxes, if any, shall
be credited to the Companys Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the Effective
Time.

6.22 _Propco Guaranty_. At the Closing, Parent shall assume all of Central
Parking Corporations obligations and liabilities under each Guaranty of
Lease executed and delivered by Central Parking Corporation pursuant to the
Agreement of Purchase and Sale by and among CPC Realty, LLC, Allright
Corporation and CBV Parking I, LLC, dated as of November 30, 2011, as amended
(the " _Property Sale Agreement_ "); _provided_ , that each Guaranty of Lease
is substantially in the form attached to the Third Amendment to the Property
Sale Agreement dated December 12, 2011, but with no rent prepayment
obligation. Parents assumption of such obligations and liabilities under each
Guaranty of Lease shall be pursuant to a written assumption agreement in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer under the Property Sale
Agreement (or its applicable successor).

 



88 6.23 _Closing Agreements_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each of the Company Stockholders that has not already
executed a Closing Agreement to execute a Closing Agreement as soon as
reasonably possible after the date hereof and in any event prior to the
Effective Time.

 

6.24 _Bodenhamer Agreements_. The Company shall provide Parent with a written
summary of all verbal Contracts between any of the Target Companies and
William H. Bodenhamer Jr. by April 1, 2012.

in writing, specifying the basis of such claim and the facts pertaining
thereto, and the Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying Party so elects, may
assume and control the defense thereof at the Indemnifying Partys expense
(and shall consult with the Indemnified Party with respect thereto),
including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ _that_ , as a condition precedent to the Indemnifying
Partys right to assume control of such defense, the Indemnifying Party must

control the defense of a Third Party Claim and elects to do so, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel separate from
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party in any such action and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party unless (A) the Indemnifying Party has specifically agreed in writing
otherwise, (B) the Indemnified Party has been advised by outside counsel that
a reasonable likelihood exists of a material conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, or (C) the Indemnifying Party
has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel; in which case the fees
and expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party
may not enter into a settlement or consent to any judgment without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party unless (i) such settlement or
judgment involves monetary damages only, all of which will be paid, without
limitation, by the Indemnifying Party and no admission of fault or culpability
on behalf of any Indemnifying Party, and (ii) a term of the settlement or
judgment is that the Person or Persons asserting such claim unconditionally
and irrevocably release all Indemnified Parties from all liability with
respect to such claim; otherwise, the consent of the Indemnified Party shall
be required in order to enter into any settlement of, or consent to the entry
of a judgment with respect to, any claim (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withhold, delayed or conditioned). A failure by an
Indemnified Party to give timely, complete or accurate notice as provided in
this _Article 9_ will not affect the rights or obligations of any party
hereunder except and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, any
party entitled to receive such notice was deprived of its right to recover
any payment under its applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise directly
and materially damaged as a result of such failure to give timely notice. If
the Indemnifying Party does not assume and/or is not controlling the defense
of a Third Party Claim for any reason, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to employ counsel

 



101  separate from counsel employed by the Indemnified Party in any such action and
to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party shall be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party may not enter into a settlement or
consent to any judgment of any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

(c) The provisions set forth in _Section 9.4(b)_ shall not apply to any
suits, actions, claims, proceedings, investigations, arbitrations and/or
mediations in existence as of the Closing Date (the " _Existing Litigation
Matters_ "). From and after the Closing, Parent shall have the sole and
exclusive right to control the defense of all Existing Litigation Matters and
the sole and exclusive right to settle or consent to any judgment with
respect to any Existing Litigation Matters. From and after the Closing, Parent
shall manage the Existing Litigation Matters in a commercially reasonable
manner. For purposes of clarification (i) from and after the Closing,
the Company Stockholders shall have no right to participate in the defense of
any Existing Litigation Matters and shall have no right to approve the
settlement or consent to any judgment with respect to any Existing Litigation
Matters and (ii) following the Closing, Parent shall have the sole and
exclusive right determine which (if any) structural repair and maintenance
expenditures are made by or on behalf of the Target Companies.

 

(d) Any claim by an Indemnified Party for indemnification other than
indemnification against a Third Party Claim will be asserted by giving the
Indemnifying Party written notice thereof, and the Indemnifying Party will
have a period of sixty (60) calendar days within which to respond to such
claims. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such sixty (60)
calendar day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted
such claim.

9.5 _Materiality Qualifiers_. For purposes of determining the amount of
Adverse Consequences arising from a breach for which Parent Indemnified
Parties or Company Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under
_Sections 9.1(a)_ or _9.2(a)_  all qualifications contained in the
representations and warranties of Parent or the Company contained in this
Agreement that are based on materiality (including all usages of "material",
"Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers) will be disregarded.

9.6 _Investigation_. An Indemnified Partys right to indemnification, payment
of Adverse Consequences or other remedies based on any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation of another party contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted by such Indemnified Party or any of its representatives or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by any such Indemnified
Party or its representatives, in each case, at any time, whether before or
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) Parent or the Company (as applicable,
the " _Breaching Party_ ") notifies the other (the " _Non-Breaching Party_ ")
in writing prior to the Closing that the Breaching Party has breached this
Agreement, (ii) such notice includes a reasonably detailed description of such
breach, (iii) the Breaching Party acknowledges in such notice that it will be
unable to satisfy its conditions to Closing and therefore the Non-Breaching
Party has the right to terminate this Agreement, and (iv) the Non-Breaching
thereafter elects to waive such conditions, then the Non-Breaching Party shall
not be entitled to any right to indemnification, payment of Adverse
Consequences or other remedies based on such breach.

 



102  9.7 _Payment_.

 

(a) Any indemnification obligation under this Agreement for any Adverse
Consequences shall be net of (i) any Tax Savings attributable to such Adverse
Consequences (or as a direct result of an adjustment by a Tax authority
directly corresponding to such Adverse Consequences) actually realized by the
Indemnified Party after the Closing in the taxable year during which such
Adverse Consequences occurs or in the immediately following taxable year, and
(ii) any insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment actually received by the Indemnified Party from any third party
with respect thereto, net of any expenses and increase in applicable
premiums/retro-premiums related to the recovery of such proceeds, provided,
however, that to the extent that such Tax Savings is subsequently denied by
any Taxing authority, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified
Party the appropriate portion of the amount of such Tax Savings previously
used to reduce the Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligation pursuant to
this _Section 9.7(a)_. In the event that any insurance or other recovery is
recognized or received by any Indemnified Party with respect to any
indemnification obligation for which any such Indemnified Party has been
indemnified under this Agreement, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount
of the recovery (up to the aggregate amount previously paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such indemnification obligation) shall be
made promptly to the Indemnifying Party, net of any expenses and increase in
applicable premiums/retro-premiums related to the recovery of such proceeds.
The Indemnified Party shall be deemed to realize a tax savings (" _Tax
Savings_ ") with respect to any Adverse Consequences in any taxable year if,
and to the extent that, the Indemnified Partys actual liability for Taxes
for such taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable to
the applicable Adverse Consequences, exceeds the Indemnified Partys actual
liability for Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by taking into account
any Tax items attributable to such Adverse Consequences for such taxable year.

(b) Payments of all amounts owing by an Indemnifying Party under this _Article
9_ shall be made promptly upon a final settlement among the Indemnifying
Parties and the Indemnified Parties or upon a final adjudication determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction that an indemnification obligation is
owed by an Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party under this _Article 9_.
Any payment that is not made within ten (10) Business Days of the
determination that such obligation is owing shall bear interest at a rate of
ten percent (10%) per annum, or, if less, the maximum rate permitted by
applicable Law. In addition, the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for any and all costs or expenses of any nature or kind
whatsoever (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in seeking
to collect payment under this _Article 9_ , and no limitation in this _Article
9_ shall apply to such reimbursement or to any interest paid or to be paid
pursuant to this _Section 9.7_.

 



103  (c) _Payment by Company Stockholders_.

 

(i) _Payment of Capped Items_. Any amount to be paid by the Company
Stockholders to satisfy their indemnification obligations for claims made
under _Sections 9.1(a)_ , _Section 9.1(b)_ in respect of _Section
6.9(a)(xv)_ and _(xvi)_ , _9.1(c)_ and _9.1(e)_ , shall be deemed to be paid
to Parent by reducing the amount of Cash Consideration that would otherwise
be payable to the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 3.7_ dollar for
dollar by an amount equal to such obligations.

 

(ii) _Payment of Uncapped Items_. Any amount to be paid by the Company
Stockholders to satisfy their indemnification obligations for claims made
under _Sections 9.1(b)_ (except in respect of _Section 6.9(a)(xv)_ and
_(xvi)_ ), _9.1(d)_ , _9.1(f)_ , _9.1(g)_ and _9.1(h)_ , shall be payable,
upon the election of the Stockholders Representative, by either (A)
satisfying such obligations with cash or with shares of Parent Common Stock
(valued for such purposes at the Closing Share Value) (each, a " _Cash or
Stock Election_ "), or (B) satisfying such obligations by deeming such
amounts to be paid to Parent by reducing the amount of Cash Consideration that
would otherwise be payable to the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section
3.7_ dollar for dollar by an amount equal to such obligations (each, a "
_Deduction Election_ "), but only to the extent the Cash Consideration that
remains payable to the Company Stockholders after satisfying such obligations
pursuant to _Section 3.7_ is at least Seventeen Million Dollars
($17,000,000.00), and thereafter the Company Stockholders must satisfy any
unpaid obligations with cash or with shares of Parent Common Stock (valued for
such purposes at the Closing Share Value). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Stockholders Representative makes a Cash or Stock Election pursuant to
this _Section 9.7(c)(ii)_, Parent shall have the right to reject such cash or
shares of Parent Common Stock, and instead deem the amounts owed by the
Company Stockholders pursuant to their indemnification obligations to be paid
to Parent by reducing the amount of Cash Consideration that would otherwise be
payable to the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 3.7_ dollar for
dollar by an amount equal to such obligations.

(iii) _Replenishment_. To the extent that a payment pursuant to _Section
9.7(c)(i)_ would cause the Cash Consideration that remains payable to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 3.7_ to be reduced below Seventeen
Million Dollars ($17,000,000.00) (the amount of such shortfall, the " _Cash
Consideration Shortfall Amount_ "), the Company Stockholders shall promptly
pay Parent (each such payment, a " _Replenishment_ ") an aggregate amount in
cash equal to the lesser of (A) the Cash Consideration Shortfall Amount and
(B) an amount equal to (X) the aggregate amount of Deduction Elections made
pursuant to _Section 9.7(c)(ii)(B)_, less (Y) any Replenishments previously
made by the Company Stockholders to Parent pursuant to this _Section
9.7(c)(iii)_. For purposes of clarification, if the Stockholders
Representative makes a Cash or Stock Election to satisfy an indemnification
obligation and Parent rejects such cash or shares, the Company Stockholders
shall not have a Replenishment obligation pursuant to this _Section
9.7(c)(iii)_ with respect to such indemnification obligation.

 



104  (d) _Payment by Parent_. Parent shall be entitled to satisfy
its indemnification obligations under this _Article 9_ with cash or by
issuing additional shares of Parent Common Stock (valued for such purposes at
the Closing Share Value).

9.8 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Any indemnification received under
this _Article 9_ shall be treated by Parent, the Company Stockholders and
their respective Affiliates, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, as an
adjustment to the consideration received by the Company Stockholders.

9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Other than the rights of the parties hereto to seek
specific performance, injunctive or other equitable relief, or in the case of
fraud or any willful and malicious breach, the provisions of this Agreement
set forth the exclusive rights and remedies of the parties hereto to seek or
obtain damages or any other remedy or relief from any party with respect to
matters arising under this Agreement.

9.10 _Adjustments to the Net Debt and Working Capital Threshold and Base Cash
Amount_. To the extent that (a) any of the Target Companies makes a payment
before the Effective Time with respect to any Indemnified Item set forth on
the Company Indemnified Items Schedule, which if such payment had been made
after the Effective Time would have resulted in an indemnification obligation
on the part of the Company Stockholders pursuant to  _Section 9.1(c)_
hereof, (b) such payment is made using Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Target
Companies and does not increase the Indebtedness of the Target Companies, (c)
such payment would increase the Combined Net Debt and Working Capital of the
Target Companies and (d) the Company obtains the consent of Parent to make
such payment (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld conditioned or
delayed), then (i) the Net Debt and Working Capital Threshold shall be
increased dollar-for-dollar by an amount equal to such payment, (ii) the Base
Cash Amount shall be decreased dollar-for-dollar by an amount equal to such
payment (iii) any applicable deductibles contained herein shall be
reduced accordingly, without duplication.

9.11 _Identified Dispute Adjustment_. To the extent the Company settles or
otherwise resolves the dispute set forth in item #11 on _Section 6.1(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, the proceeds of such settlement received by the
Company (the " _Identified Dispute Proceeds_ ") shall (a) reduce the
Lower Indemnification Threshold by an amount equal to the Identified Dispute
Proceeds, (b) reduce the Upper Indemnification Threshold by an amount equal to
the Identified Dispute Proceeds and (c) reduce the Net Debt and Working
Capital Threshold by the lesser of (i) the Identified Dispute Proceeds and
(ii) $2,300,000.

agree that all claims, controversies and disputes of any kind or nature
arising under or relating in any way to the enforcement or interpretation of
this Agreement or to the parties dealings, rights or obligations in
connection herewith, including disputes relating to the negotiations for,
inducements to enter into, or execution of, this Agreement, and disputes
concerning the interpretation, enforceability, performance,
breach, termination or validity of all or any portion of this Agreement shall
be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its choice
or conflicts of laws principles.

 

10.12 _Disputes_.

(a) _Pre-Closing Disputes_. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto
agree that all claims, controversies and disputes of any kind or nature
relating in any way to the enforcement or interpretation of this Agreement or
to the parties dealings, rights or obligations in connection herewith, shall
be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or,
if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court of the United
States located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware nor any such federal court has jurisdiction, any
other state court located in the State of Delaware. With respect to any such
claims, controversies or disputes, each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably:

(i) submits itself and its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action in any court or tribunal other than the aforesaid courts;

 

(ii) waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding (A) any claim that it
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for
any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
_Section 10.12_, (B) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (C) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any
claim that (1) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (2) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding
is improper or (3) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts; and

 



111  (iii) WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (II) SUCH PARTY HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
10.12._

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 10.12_, a party may
commence any action or proceeding in a court other than the above-named courts
solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the
above-named courts.

(b) _Post-Closing Disputes_. Except as set forth in _Section 10.17_, on or
after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree that all claims,
controversies and disputes of any kind or nature relating in any way to the
enforcement or interpretation of this Agreement or to the parties dealings,
rights or obligations in connection herewith, shall be exclusively resolved by
final and binding arbitration before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Services (" _JAMS_ "). The parties hereto further agree that any disagreement
as to whether a particular type of claim, controversy or dispute is subject to
arbitration shall, regardless of the nature of the dispute, be decided
exclusively by the arbitrators, and not by a court, it being the
parties intention that no dispute or controversy relating in any manner
whatsoever to this Agreement or their dealings in connection herewith shall be
submitted to litigation in a state or federal court. Each party hereto agrees
that the award of the arbitrators shall be final, binding and non-appealable
and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between and among the parties
regarding any matter presented to the arbitrator, regardless of the magnitude
thereof. All arbitration proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to JAMS
Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (" _JAMS Rules_ "). Arbitration
shall be conducted exclusively in Chicago, Illinois, before three (3) neutral
arbitrators domiciled there, who shall be appointed by agreement of the
parties or, in the event the parties are unable to agree on three (3)
arbitrators within ten (10) calendar days following the commencement of the
arbitration (or sooner if a party submits a request for injunctive or interim
relief before an agreement on arbitrators has been reached), in accordance
with JAMS Rule 12. The arbitrators shall award attorneys fees to the
prevailing party, and shall have the discretion to make a full or
partial award of attorneys fees based upon their determination of the extent
to which a party achieved the relief sought in its pleadings or prevailed with
respect to the issues in controversy. The arbitration, including the
arbitration award, shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.
§ 1 _et seq_.), and judgment upon the award may be confirmed and entered by
any court having competent jurisdiction over the parties or their assets.

 



112  (c) _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, Parent: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any
Person in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the
Financing Sources (which defined term for the purposes of this provision shall
include the Financing Sources and their respective Affiliates, equityholders,
members, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
representatives involved in the financing contemplated by the Financing
Letter) in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other
than the federal and New York State courts located in the Borough of Manhattan
within the City of New York; (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set
forth in the Financing Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing
Sources in any way relating to the Financing Letter or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New
York, without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of
laws of another jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
litigation (whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to the protections of, this _Section 10.12(c)_.

 

(d) _Net Working Capital; Net Debt_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees that any
dispute regarding the calculation of Company Net Debt and/or Company Net
Working Capital (whether prior to or after the Closing), shall be subject to
the following procedures:

 

(i) The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute promptly
through negotiations between representatives who have authority to settle the
dispute. If the dispute is not resolved through such negotiations within ten
(10) days of the commencement of such negotiations (which period may be
extended by written agreement of the parties), then the items in dispute
shall be submitted to an Accounting Firm.

(ii) The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to render a determination of the
applicable dispute within thirty (30) days after referral of the matter to the
Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firms determination must be in writing and
must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The parties shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause

 



113   the Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute as soon as practicable. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the
parties and that judgment may be entered upon the determination of the
Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which
such determination is to be enforced.

(iii) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be
limited to only such items that are in dispute and the Accounting Firm shall
determine, based solely on presentations by the parties hereto and their
respective representatives, and not by independent review, only those issues
specifically in dispute. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm
shall be bound by the principles set forth in this  _Section 10.12(d)_ and
shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party.

 

(iv) Each of Parent, on the one hand, and the Company Stockholders, on the
other hand, shall bear that percentage of the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm equal to the proportion (expressed as a percentage) of the
dollar value of the disputed amounts determined in favor of the other party by
the Accounting Firm.

 

10.13 _Survival of Covenants_. The covenants of the parties to be performed
subsequent to Closing shall survive Closing for the periods stated therein
or, if no period is stated, until they have been fully performed.

10.14 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
shall not, confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, except as otherwise expressly provided in _Section 6.12(d)_,
_Article 9_ , and _Section 10.12(d)_. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with _Section 10.3_ without notice or liability to any other
person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters, regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in _Article 9_ , persons other than the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub (and after the Closing, the Company Stockholders) may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. 

10.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
and all such executed counterparts shall constitute the same agreement. It
shall be necessary to account for only one such counterpart in proving the
existence of terms of this Agreement.

10.16 _Electronic Execution and Delivery_. A facsimile, PDF or other
reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto,
and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more
parties by facsimile, e-mail or other electronic transmission device pursuant
to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such
execution and

  



114   delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes.
At the request of any party, all parties agree to execute an original of this
Agreement as well as any facsimile or reproduction thereof. The parties
hereto hereby agree that neither shall raise the execution of facsimile, PDF
or other reproduction of this Agreement, or the fact that any signature or
document was transmitted or communicated by facsimile, e-mail or other
electronic transmission device, as a defense to the formation of this
Agreement.

10.17 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge that their obligations
hereunder are unique and that remedies at law, including monetary damages,
will be inadequate in the event any party should default in the performance of
its obligations under this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event of any such
breach, the non-defaulting parties shall be entitled to seek equitable relief,
without the proof of actual damages, including in the form of an injunction or
injunctions or orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to order the defaulting party to affirmatively carry out its
obligations under this Agreement, and such defaulting party hereby waives any
defense to the effect that a remedy at law would be an adequate remedy for
such breach or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason of law or equity. Such equitable relief shall be in
addition to any other remedy to which the parties hereto are entitled to at
law or in equity as a remedy for such nonperformance, breach or threatened
breach. Each party hereby waives any requirements for the securing or posting
of any bond or other security or showing actual damages in connection with
such equitable remedy. The foregoing shall not be deemed to be or construed
as a waiver or election of remedies by any party, each of which expressly
reserve any and all rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity in
the event of any breach or default by the other parties under this Agreement
prior to the Closing.

10.18 _Expenses_. The Company Stockholders (pursuant to their agreement to
be bound by the terms of this _Section 10.18_ in their applicable Closing
Agreement) hereby agree that all costs and expenses, including fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated by hereby and thereby on behalf of the Company
Stockholders and/or the Target Companies prior to the Effective Time shall be
paid by the Company Stockholders, whether or not the Closing shall have
occurred or this Agreement is terminated. Parent hereby agrees that all costs
and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors
and accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated by hereby and
thereby on behalf of Parent and/or Merger Sub shall be paid by Parent, whether
or not the Closing shall have occurred or this Agreement is terminated.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, on the one hand, and the Company
Stockholders, on the other hand, shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of (i) the
filing fees required to be paid under the HSR Act in connection with any
filings and (ii) the reasonable fees and expenses of an economic consultant
(which shall be Charles River Associates) with respect to issues relating to
the HSR Act, provided such amounts are approved in advance by the Company and
Parent.

 

10.19 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement,
references to numbers of shares and prices per share of Parent Common Stock
contained in this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted for stock splits,
stock dividends, stock combinations or other similar transactions that occur
after the date of this Agreement.

 



115  10.20 _Stockholders  Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of the execution of the applicable Closing Agreements, each of
the Company Stockholders has irrevocably constituted and appointed, Kohlberg
CPC Rep, L.L.C. (and by its execution of this Agreement as Stockholders
Representative, Kohlberg CPC Rep, L.L.C. hereby accepts its appointment) as
the true, exclusive and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact (the "
_Stockholders  Representative_") of the Company Stockholders to act in the
name, place and stead of the Company Stockholders in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, and to act on behalf of the Company Stockholders
in any action, suit or proceeding involving this Agreement, to do or refrain
from doing all such further acts and things, and to execute all such documents
as the Stockholders Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
power:

(i) to act for the Company Stockholders with regard to matters pertaining to
indemnification referred to in this Agreement, including the power to
compromise or settle any indemnity claim on behalf of the Company
Stockholders and to transact matters of litigation or other actions, suits or
proceedings;

(ii) to execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
stock powers, certificates and documents that the Stockholders Representative
deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of
the Company Stockholders that the Stockholders Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement as fully and completely as the Company Stockholders could do
if personally present; and

(iv) to receive service of process on behalf of any Company Stockholder in
connection with any claims under this Agreement.

(b) The Stockholders Representative may be removed or replaced only
upon delivery of written notice to the Surviving Corporation by the Company
Stockholders holding at least a majority of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and any other Person may conclusively and absolutely
rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the Stockholders Representative in
all matters referred to herein.

(c) The Stockholders Representative will incur no liability to any Company
Stockholder with respect to any action taken or suffered by any party in
reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other
document believed by the Stockholders Representative to be genuine and to
have been signed by the proper Person (and the Stockholders Representative
shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity thereof), nor for
any other action or inaction, except its own gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct.

 



116  (d) The Company Stockholders shall severally, in accordance with and
limited to their applicable Pro Rata Share, and not jointly, indemnify and
hold harmless the Stockholders Representative against any loss, liability or
expense incurred by the Stockholders Representative (without gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholders
Representative) arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Stockholders Representatives duties hereunder,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel (or other
advisor) retained by the Stockholders Representative.
