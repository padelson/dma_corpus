Each Election Form shall permit the holder of ProCentury Common Shares including Restricted Stock (or in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation), other than Dissenting Shareholders, subject to the conditions set forth in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, (i) to elect to receive Meadowbrook Common Stock with respect to all of such holders ProCentury Common Shares as hereinabove provided (a "Stock Election"), (ii) to elect to receive cash with respect to all of such holders ProCentury Common Shares as hereinabove provided (a "Cash Election"), (iii) to elect to receive cash with respect to some of such holders shares and shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock with respect to such holders remaining shares (a "Mixed Election") or (iv) to indicate that such holder makes no such election with respect to such holders ProCentury Common Shares (a "Non-Election").

   ##### 

  

    

ProCentury Common Shares on behalf of multiple beneficial owners shall

Election Shares and No-Election Shares. If a shareholder either (i) does not
submit a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline or (ii)
revokes an Election Form prior to the Election Deadline and does not resubmit
a properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline, the
ProCentury Common Shares held by such shareholder (unless such shares are
then Dissenting Shares) shall be designated No-Election Shares. Meadowbrook
and ProCentury shall make available one or more Election Forms as may be
reasonably requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of ProCentury Common Shares between the record date for
the ProCentury Shareholder Meeting and the Election Deadline. 

  

 (b) _Election Deadline_. The term "Election Deadline" shall mean 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) _Effective Election_. Any election to receive Meadowbrook Common Stock or cash shall have been properly made only if LaSalle Bank National Association, which will act as the exchange agent for purposes of conducting the election procedure and the exchange procedure described in this Section 3.2 and Section 3.3 (the "Exchange Agent"), shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent (or any other Person to whom the subject ProCentury Common Shares are subsequently transferred) by written notice to the Exchange Agent only if such written notice is actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election Deadline. The Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine when any election, modification or revocation is received, whether any such election, modification or revocation has been properly made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Meadowbrook, Merger Sub, ProCentury nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form. 

  

 (d) _Allocation_. Solely for purposes of calculating the allocations pursuant to this Section 3.2(d), Dissenting Shareholders will be deemed to have a right to receive Cash Consideration. Subject to Section 3.2(f), the Exchange Agent shall effect the allocation among holders of ProCentury Common Shares of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows: 

  

 (i) _Maximum Cash Consideration Undersubscribed_. If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share Cash Consideration is less than the Maximum Cash Consideration, then: 

  

 (1) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive cash; 

  

 (2) No-Election Shares shall then be deemed to be Cash Election Shares to the extent necessary to have the total number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share Cash Consideration equal the Maximum Cash Consideration. If less than all of the 

   ##### 

  

    

No-Election Shares need to be treated as Cash Election Shares in accordance
with this clause (2), then the Exchange Agent shall select which No-Election
Shares shall be treated as Cash Election Shares in such manner as the Exchange
Agent shall determine, and all remaining No-Election Shares shall thereafter
be treated as Stock Election Shares; 

  

 (3) if all of the No-Election Shares are treated as Cash Election Shares under the preceding subsection and the total number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share Cash Consideration is less than the Maximum Cash Consideration, then the Exchange Agent shall convert on a pro rata basis as described in Section 3.2(e) hereof a sufficient number of Stock Election Shares into Cash Election Shares ("Reallocated Cash Shares") such that the sum of the number of Cash Election Shares plus the number of Reallocated Cash Shares times the Per Share Cash Consideration equals the Maximum Cash Consideration, and all Reallocated Cash Shares will be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive cash; and 

  

 (4) the Stock Election Shares which are not Reallocated Cash Shares shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive Meadowbrook Common Stock. 

  

 (ii) _Maximum Cash Consideration Oversubscribed_. If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share Cash Consideration is greater than the Maximum Cash Consideration, then: 

  

 (1) all Stock Election Shares and all No-Election Shares shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive Meadowbrook Common Stock; 

  

 (2) the Exchange Agent shall convert on a pro rata basis as described in Section 3.2(e) a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares ("Reallocated Stock Shares") into Stock Election Shares times the Per Share Cash Consideration such that the number of remaining Cash Election Shares equals the Maximum Cash Consideration, and all Reallocated Stock Shares shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive Meadowbrook Common Stock; and 

  

 (3) the Cash Election Shares which are not Reallocated Stock Shares shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive cash. 

  

 (iii) _Maximum Consideration Satisfied_. If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Per Share Cash Consideration is equal to the Maximum Cash Consideration, then subparagraphs (d)(i) and (ii) above shall not apply and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive cash and all No-Election Shares and all Stock Election Shares will be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive Meadowbrook Common Stock. 

  

 (e) _Pro Rata Reallocations_. In the event that the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to Section 3.2(d)(i)(3) to convert some Stock Election Shares into Reallocated Cash Shares, each holder of Stock Election Shares (based upon the number of Stock Election Shares held) shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the total Reallocated Cash Shares. In the event the 

   ##### 

  

    

Exchange Agent is required pursuant to Section 3.2(d)(ii)(2) to convert some
Cash Election Shares (based upon the number of Cash Election Shares held)
into Reallocated Stock Shares, each holder of Cash Election Shares shall be
allocated a pro rata portion of the total Reallocated Stock Shares. 

  

 (f) _Adjustment Per Tax Opinion_. Notwithstanding anything in this Article III to the contrary, if, based on the Exchange Ratio determined in accordance with Section 3.1(a), the Tax Ratio (as defined below) is less than 55% (or such lesser percentage, not below 40%, as shall be reasonably agreed to by tax counsel to ProCentury and Meadowbrook to enable such tax counsel to deliver the tax opinions referred to in Article VIII) (the "Minimum Tax Ratio"), the number of Cash Election Shares (but for this Section 3.2(f)) shall be reduced by the minimum extent necessary (the amount of such reduction, the "Reduction Amount") so that the Tax Ratio is equal to the Minimum Tax Ratio. The reduction and reallocation required by this Section 3.2(f) shall be effected in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.2(e). "Tax Ratio" shall mean the ratio of (i) the product of (A) the closing price per share of Meadowbrook Common Stock on the Closing Date times (B) the excess of (x) the Stock Consideration over (y) the number of shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock that tax counsel to Meadowbrook or ProCentury reasonably deems necessary to exclude for purposes of the "continuity-of-interest" requirements under applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations described in the Code (such product, the "Aggregate Stock Amount"), to (ii) the sum of (u) the Aggregate Stock Amount plus (v) the aggregate cash payable pursuant to this Section 3.2 (plus the aggregate estimated amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.5) plus (w) the number of Dissenting Shares times the per share fair value of such shares determined pursuant to applicable Law or, if such fair value has not been determined as of the date the calculation required by this Section 3.2(f) is required to be made, then times the greater of (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (B) the value of the number of shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (calculated for the purposes of this Section 3.2(f) based on the closing price per share of Meadowbrook Common Stock on the Closing Date), plus (x) any other amounts paid by ProCentury (or any affiliate thereof) to, or on behalf of, any holder of ProCentury Common Shares in connection with the sale, redemption or other disposition of any ProCentury Common Shares in connection with the Merger for purposes of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-1(e) and 1.368-1T(e) plus (y) any extraordinary dividend distributed by ProCentury prior to and in connection with the Merger for purposes of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-1(e) and 1.368-1T(e), plus (z) the amount of any other items that tax counsel to Meadowbrook or ProCentury reasonably deems necessary to take into account for purposes of making the Merger satisfy the requirements under applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations described in the Code. If necessary or advisable under the applicable Treasury Regulations, payments made in respect of ProCentury Options under Section 3.9 shall be taken into account in determining the Reduction Amount. 

  

 3.3 _Exchange Procedures_  

  

 (a) _Mailing of Transmittal Material_. Meadowbrook shall cause the Exchange Agent to, no later than five (5) business days after the Closing Date, mail or make available to each holder of record of ProCentury Common Shares a notice and letter of transmittal (which 

   ##### 

  

    

shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger
and the procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent such holders stock
certificate or certificates representing ProCentury Common Shares
("Certificate") in exchange for the consideration set forth in Section 3.1(a)
deliverable in respect of such shares pursuant to this Agreement. A letter of
transmittal will be properly completed only if accompanied by Certificates
representing all ProCentury Common Shares covered thereby, subject to the
provisions of paragraph (d) of this Section 3.3. 

  

 (b) _Meadowbrook Deliveries_. At the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of ProCentury Common Shares, Meadowbrook shall deliver to the Exchange Agent (i) certificates evidencing the number of shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock issuable and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the Cash Consideration payable, in each case, pursuant to this Article III in exchange for outstanding ProCentury Common Shares. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the Persons entitled thereto. 

  

 (c) _Exchange Agent Deliveries_. After completion of the allocations referred to in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of Section 3.2, each holder of an outstanding ProCentury Common Share who has surrendered the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares to the Exchange Agent (or otherwise complied with Section 3.3(d) or the other procedures established by the Exchange Agent with respect to the matters set forth therein) will, upon acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive a number of whole shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock (represented by a certificate or, as applicable, issued in book-entry only form) and/or the amount of cash into which the aggregate number of ProCentury Common Shares surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (including, but not limited to, payment for fractional shares under Section 3.5) and, if such holders ProCentury Common Shares have been converted into Meadowbrook Common Stock, any other distribution theretofore paid with respect to Meadowbrook Common Stock after the Effective Time, in each case without interest. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Each outstanding Certificate which prior to the Effective Time represented ProCentury Common Shares and which is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent be deemed to evidence ownership of the number of shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock and/or the right to receive the amount of cash into which such ProCentury Common Shares shall have been converted. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of ProCentury of ProCentury Common Shares and if such shares are presented to ProCentury for transfer, they shall be cancelled against delivery of shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock or cash as hereinabove provided. No dividends which have been declared will be remitted to any Person entitled to receive shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock under Section 3.2 until such Person surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing 

   ##### 

  

    

ProCentury Common Shares (or otherwise complied with Section 3.3(d) or the
other procedures established by the Exchange Agent with respect to the
matters set forth therein), at which time such dividends shall be remitted to
such Person, without interest. 

  

 (d) _Lost or Destroyed Certificates; Issuances of Meadowbrook Common Stock in New Names_. The Exchange Agent, Merger Sub and Meadowbrook, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock to which a holder of ProCentury Common Shares would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the ProCentury Common Shares for exchange as provided in this Section 3.3, or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be reasonably required in each case by Merger Sub and Meadowbrook. If any certificates evidencing shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate evidencing ProCentury Common Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (e) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock and cash delivered to the Exchange Agent by Meadowbrook pursuant to Section 3.3(b) that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of ProCentury for nine (9) months after the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Meadowbrook. Any shareholders of ProCentury who have not theretofore complied with Section 3.3(c) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for the consideration deliverable in respect of each ProCentury Common Share such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for ProCentury Common Shares are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any Party shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. The Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of ProCentury as of the Effective Time to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any consideration represented 

   ##### 

  

    

thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved
with respect to any claims thereto. 

  

 3.4 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time, holders of ProCentury Common Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of ProCentury other than to receive the consideration provided under this Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of ProCentury of ProCentury Common Shares. 

  

 3.5 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of ProCentury Common Shares who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Meadowbrook Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the Average Closing Date Meadowbrook Share Price, rounded to the nearest whole cent or if there is no nearest whole cent, to the next higher whole cent. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share. 

  

 3.6 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period (a "Capital Change"), the Per Share Stock Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly. 

  

 3.7 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation and Meadowbrook (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of ProCentury Common Shares such amounts as the Surviving Corporation and Meadowbrook is required under the Code or any state, local or foreign tax law or regulation thereunder to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of ProCentury Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Meadowbrook, as applicable. 

  

 3.8 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent required by the Ohio Revised Code, ProCentury Common Shares which are issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time and which are held by any shareholder of ProCentury who shall not have voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the ProCentury Shareholder Meeting and who files with ProCentury within ten (10) days after such vote at the ProCentury Shareholder Meeting a written demand to be paid the fair cash value for such ProCentury Common Shares ("Dissenting Shares") in accordance with Section 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the Ohio Revised Code ("Dissenting Shareholder") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration or Per Share Stock Consideration as provided in Section 3.1, 

   ##### 

  

    

unless and until such shareholder fails to demand payment properly or
otherwise loses such shareholders rights as a Dissenting Shareholder, if
any, under the Ohio Revised Code. If any such Dissenting Shareholder fails to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such rights as a
Dissenting Shareholder, that Dissenting Shareholders Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time as if
that Dissenting Shareholder had made a Mixed Election, with 45% of that
Dissenting Shareholders Dissenting Shares being treated as Cash Election
Shares and 55% of that Dissenting Shareholders Dissenting Shares being
treated as Stock Election Shares. From and after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Shareholder who has asserted rights provided in Section 1701.84
and 1701.85 of the Ohio Revised Code shall be entitled to only those rights as
are granted under those provisions of the Ohio Revised Code. ProCentury shall
give Meadowbrook and Merger Sub (i) prompt notice of any shareholder who has
asserted rights as dissenting shareholder, attempted withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code
that are received by ProCentury relating to purported Dissenting Shareholders
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to Dissenting Shareholders. Prior to the Effective Time, ProCentury
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Meadowbrook and Merger
Sub, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any rights of a Dissenting Shareholder asserted under Section 1701.85 of the
Ohio Revised Code. Following the Effective Time, Meadowbrook shall be solely
responsible for the settlement and payment of any claims of a Dissenting
Shareholder. 

  

 3.9 _Restricted Shares and Options_. The board of directors of ProCentury shall take such action as is necessary so that at the Effective Time, each outstanding ProCentury Common Share that was granted as a restricted share award and remains unvested as of the Effective Time (the "Restricted Stock") under the ProCentury Option Plans, shall become fully vested and, accordingly, at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall have the rights of any holder of ProCentury Common Shares to receive the consideration provided for in this Article III. The board of directors of each of ProCentury and Meadowbrook shall take such action as is necessary so that at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase ProCentury Common Shares (a "ProCentury Option") under the ProCentury Option Plans, shall become fully vested and exercisable. ProCentury will provide that a holder of a ProCentury Option may exercise the ProCentury Option and complete an Election Form conditioned on consummation of the Merger so that if the Merger is not completed the ProCentury Options will remain subject to their respective original vesting schedules. In the event of any such conditional exercise and election, all ProCentury Common Shares underlying such exercised ProCentury Options will be deemed to have been issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of Section 3.1. If a holder of a ProCentury Option so elects and executes an appropriate acknowledgement or waiver, a ProCentury Option may be canceled in exchange for the right to receive from Meadowbrook a single lump cash payment, equal to the product of (i) the number of ProCentury Common Shares subject to such ProCentury Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash Consideration over the exercise price per share of such ProCentury Option (the "Option Merger Consideration") less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Subject to the foregoing, the ProCentury Option Plans and all ProCentury Options issued thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time.

 4.5 _Reports_. 

  

 (a) ProCentury has filed or furnished, as applicable, all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since January 1, 2006 (the "Applicable Date") (the forms, statements, reports and documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date hereof, including any amendments thereto, the "ProCentury Reports"). Each of the ProCentury Reports, as of its respective date (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment), complied in all material respects with, to the extent in effect at the time of filing, the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment), the ProCentury Reports did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 (b) Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including Section 13(k) or rules of the SEC, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither ProCentury nor any of its Subsidiaries has extended or maintained credit, arranged for the extension of credit or renewed an extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan to any executive officer or director of ProCentury within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act. 

  

 (c) ProCentury maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by ProCentury is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of ProCenturys filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. ProCentury and its Subsidiaries maintain internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). ProCentury has completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2006, and such evaluation concluded that such controls were effective. ProCentury has disclosed and identified, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date hereof, for ProCenturys auditors and the audit committee of ProCenturys board of directors (i) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect ProCenturys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, (ii) any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (iii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or 

   ##### 

  

    

other employees who have a significant role in ProCenturys internal control
over financial reporting. 

  

 4.6 _Financial Statements_.

 (b) ProCentury has previously furnished or made available to Meadowbrook and Merger Sub true and complete copies of the annual statements or other comparable statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006, together with all exhibits and schedules thereto (collectively, the "ProCentury SAP Statements"), with respect to each of the ProCentury Insurance Subsidiaries, in each case as filed with the Governmental Entity charged with supervision of insurance companies of such ProCentury Insurance Subsidiarys jurisdiction of domicile. The ProCentury SAP Statements were prepared in conformity with applicable statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by such Governmental Entity applied on a consistent basis ("SAP") and present fairly, in all material respects, the statutory financial condition and results of operations of such ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary as of the respective dates thereof or for the respective periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with SAP. Since December 31, 2005, the ProCentury SAP Statements were filed with the applicable Governmental Entity in a timely fashion on forms prescribed or permitted by such Governmental Entity, except for such filings, the failure so to file or timely file would not individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a ProCentury Material Adverse Effect. No deficiencies or violations material to the financial condition of any of the ProCentury Insurance Subsidiaries, individually, whether or not material in the aggregate, have been asserted in writing by any Governmental Entity which have not been cured or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of such Governmental Entity (unless not currently pending). ProCentury has made available to Meadowbrook and Merger Sub true and complete copies of all financial examinations, market-conduct examinations and other material reports of Governmental Entities since December 31, 2004, including the most recent reports of state insurance regulatory authorities, relating to each ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary.

   #####

 4.22 _ProCentury Insurance Subsidiaries_. 

  

 (a) As of the date hereof, ProCentury conducts its insurance operations solely through the following Subsidiaries: Century Surety Company, ProCentury Risk Partners Insurance Company and ProCentury Insurance Company (collectively, the "ProCentury Insurance Subsidiaries"). Each of the ProCentury Insurance Subsidiaries is (i) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance company and, where applicable, a reinsurance company, in its jurisdiction of incorporation, (ii) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance company and, where applicable, a reinsurance company, in each other jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed or authorized and (iii) duly authorized in its jurisdiction of incorporation and each other applicable jurisdiction to write each line of business reported as being written in the ProCentury SAP Statements, except, in any such case, where the failure to be so licensed or authorized is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a ProCentury Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) The business and operations of the ProCentury Insurance Subsidiaries, since the Applicable Date, have been and are now being conducted in compliance with all Laws relating to the regulation of insurance and market conduct recommendations resulting from market conduct examinations by insurance regulatory authorities (collectively, "Insurance Laws"), except where the failure to so conduct such business and operations is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a ProCentury Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (c) No insurance regulator in any state has notified ProCentury or any of the ProCentury Insurance Subsidiaries in writing that any ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary is commercially domiciled in any jurisdiction and to the knowledge of ProCentury, there are no facts that would result in any ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary being commercially domiciled in any state. To the knowledge of ProCentury, none of ProCentury or any ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary, or any of their respective Affiliates, (i) has purposefully engaged in, or colluded with or assisted any other Persons with, the paying of contingent commissions or similar incentive payments to steer business to them or colluded with Agents or brokers or other producers or intermediaries to "rig bids" or submit false quotes to customers or (ii) is a party to any agreement that provides for any payment by or to any Person of any variable or contingent commissions or payments based upon the profitability, claims handling, sales volume or loss ratio of the business that is the subject of such agreement. Since the Applicable Date, ProCentury and each 

   ##### 

  

    

ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary have made all required notices, submissions,
reports or other filings under applicable Insurance Law, including insurance
holding company statutes, except for any such failures or instances
of noncompliance that would not reasonably be likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a ProCentury Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (d) Neither ProCentury nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or is a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or has adopted any board resolutions at the request of (each, a "Regulatory Agreement"), any regulatory agency or other Governmental Entity that restricts the conduct of its business or that in any manner relates to its capital adequacy, its underwriting policies, its management or its business, nor has ProCentury or any of its Subsidiaries been advised by any regulatory agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing or requesting any Regulatory Agreement. 

  

 (e) Except as otherwise is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a ProCentury Material Adverse Effect, all policies, binders, slips, certificates, and other agreements of insurance, in effect as of the date hereof that are issued by the ProCentury Insurance Subsidiaries (the "ProCentury Insurance Contracts") and any and all marketing materials, are, to the extent required under applicable Law, on forms approved by applicable insurance regulatory authorities which have been filed and not objected to by such authorities within the period provided for objection (the "Forms"). The Forms comply in all material respects with the Insurance Laws applicable thereto and, as to premium rates established by any ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary which are required to be filed with or approved by insurance regulatory authorities, the rates have been so filed or approved and the premiums charged are within the amount permitted by Insurance Laws applicable thereto, except where the failure to be so filed or approved is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a ProCentury Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (f) All reinsurance and coinsurance treaties or agreements, including retrocessional agreements, to which any ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary is a party or under which any ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary has any existing rights, obligations or liabilities are in full force and effect, except for such treaties or agreements the failure to be in full force and effect of which is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a ProCentury Material Adverse Effect. Except as is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a ProCentury Material Adverse Effect, no ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary, or, to the knowledge of ProCentury, any other party to a material reinsurance or coinsurance treaty or agreement to which any ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary is a party, is in default in any material respect as to any provision thereof, and no such agreement contains any provision providing that the other party thereto may terminate such agreement, or that such agreement will be automatically terminated, by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the knowledge of ProCentury, the financial condition of the other parties to any such agreement is impaired with the result that a default thereunder may reasonably be anticipated, whether or not such default may be cured by the operation of any offset clause in such agreement, that is, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a ProCentury Material Adverse Effect. 

    ##### 

 

  

All reinsurance and retrocession agreements to which any ProCentury Insurance
Subsidiary is a party, either as a cedent or a reinsurer or retrocessionaire,
comply in all material respects with all risk transfer criteria under GAAP
and applicable SAP, and to the knowledge of ProCentury, there is no
investigation, inquiry or proceeding currently pending before or by
Governmental Entity, to which ProCentury or any ProCentury Insurance
Subsidiary is subject, with respect to the risk transfer characteristics or
the reporting or disclosure thereof, of any such reinsurance or retrocession
except any such investigation, inquiry or proceeding which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a ProCentury
Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (g) Prior to the date hereof, ProCentury has delivered or made available to Meadowbrook and Merger Sub a true and complete copy of any material actuarial reports prepared by actuaries, independent or otherwise, with respect to any ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary since the Applicable Date, and all material attachments, addenda, supplements and modifications thereto (the "ProCentury Actuarial Analyses"). The information and data furnished by any ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary to its actuaries in connection with the preparation of the ProCentury Actuarial Analyses were accurate in all material respects. The aggregate reserves for claims, losses (including incurred but not reported losses), loss adjustment expenses (whether allocated or unallocated) and unearned premium, as reflected in each of the ProCentury SAP Statements, (i) were determined in accordance with presently accepted actuarial standards consistently applied (except as otherwise noted in the financial statements and notes thereto included in such financial statements); (ii) are fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial principles; (iii) were computed on the basis of methodologies consistent in all material respects with those used in computing the corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal years (except as otherwise noted in the financial statements and notes thereto included in such financial statements) and (iv) include provisions for all actuarial reserves and related items which ought to be established in accordance with applicable Laws. 

   

 (h) A.M. Best Company has not announced that it has under surveillance or review (with negative implications) its rating of the financial strength or claims-paying ability of any ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary or imposed conditions (financial or otherwise) on retaining any currently held rating assigned to any ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary which is rated as of the date hereof, and ProCentury has no reason (other than the entry into the Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) to believe that any rating presently held by the ProCentury Insurance Subsidiaries is likely to be modified, qualified, lowered or placed under such surveillance for any reason. As of the date hereof, Century Surety Company and ProCentury Insurance Company have been assigned A- (Excellent) financial strength ratings and "a-" issuer credit ratings and ProCentury has been assigned a "bbb-" issuer credit rating by A.M. Best Company. 

   

 (i) Section 4.22(i) of the ProCentury Disclosure Schedule lists the top 60 Agents (by gross written premiums sold) of the ProCentury Insurance Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2007, and the gross written premium sold by each of these agents in such year with respect to products issued by any ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary. To the knowledge of ProCentury, the contracts and other agreements pursuant to which agents act on behalf of the ProCentury Insurance Subsidiaries are valid, binding and in full force and effect in all material respects in accordance with their terms and the parties to such contracts and agreements are not 

    ##### 

  

    

in default thereunder in any material respects. To the knowledge of
ProCentury, since January 1, 2008 through the date hereof, none of the agents
listed on Section 4.22(i) of the ProCentury Disclosure Schedule has
(a) terminated its relationship with any of the ProCentury Insurance
Subsidiaries or (b) materially decreased the placement, marketing or sales of
products issued by the ProCentury Insurance Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of
ProCentury, each insurance agent, at the time such agent wrote, sold or
produced any insurance policy for a ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary, (i) was
duly licensed as an insurance agent for the type of business written, sold or
produced in the particular jurisdiction in which such agent wrote, sold or
produced such business for such ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary and (ii) was
duly appointed as an agent by such ProCentury Insurance Subsidiary, except
for any failures to be so licensed and appointed as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a ProCentury Material Adverse Effect. ProCentury
has made available to Meadowbrook and Merger Sub a true and complete copy of
each standard form agency agreement used by ProCentury and its Subsidiaries
for new business as of the date hereof. 

   

 4.23 _Labor and Employment Matters_. Neither ProCentury nor its Subsidiaries is or has ever been a party to, or is or has ever been bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract, or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization with respect to its employees, nor is ProCentury or its Subsidiaries the subject of any proceeding asserting that it has committed an unfair labor practice or seeking to compel it or any such Subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages and conditions of employment, nor is the management of ProCentury aware of any strike, other labor dispute, organizational effort or other activity taken with a view toward unionization involving ProCentury or its Subsidiaries pending or threatened. ProCentury and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with applicable Laws regarding employment or employees and retention of independent contractors and are in material compliance with all applicable employment tax Laws. 

  

 4.24 _Insurance_. ProCentury and its Subsidiaries are presently insured, and since the Applicable Date, have been insured, for reasonable amounts with financially sound and reputable insurance companies, against such risks as companies engaged in a similar business would, in accordance with good business practice, customarily be insured. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a ProCentury Material Adverse Effect, all of the insurance policies and bonds maintained by ProCentury and its Subsidiaries outside the ordinary course of its business are in full force and effect, ProCentury and its Subsidiaries are not in default thereunder and all material claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion. 

  

 4.25 _Indemnification_. Except as provided in ProCenturys employment agreements, or the articles of incorporation or code of regulations of ProCentury, neither ProCentury nor its Subsidiaries is a party to any indemnification agreement with any of its present or future directors, officers, employees, agents or other Persons who serve or served in any other capacity with any other enterprise at the request of ProCentury (a "Covered Person"), and there are no claims for which any Covered Person would be entitled to indemnification under the articles of incorporation or code of regulations of ProCentury or any Subsidiary of ProCentury, applicable law, regulation or any indemnification agreement.

 (b) Each Meadowbrook Contract is a valid and binding obligation of Meadowbrook or its Subsidiary which is a party thereto and, to the knowledge of Meadowbrook, of each other party thereto, is in full force and effect, except where such failure to be in full force and effect would not have or be reasonably likely to have a Meadowbrook Material Adverse Effect.

Each of the Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiaries is (i) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance company and, where applicable, a reinsurance company, in its jurisdiction of incorporation, (ii) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance company and, where applicable, a reinsurance company, in each other jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed or authorized, and (iii) duly authorized in its jurisdiction of incorporation and each other applicable jurisdiction to write each line of business reported as being written in the Meadowbrook SAP Statements, except, in any such case, where the failure to be so licensed or authorized is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Meadowbrook Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) The business and operations of the Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiaries, since the Applicable Date, have been and are now being conducted in compliance with all Insurance Laws, except where the failure to so conduct such business and operations is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Meadowbrook Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (c) No insurance regulator in any state has notified Meadowbrook or any of the Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiaries in writing that any Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiary is commercially domiciled in any jurisdiction and to the knowledge of Meadowbrook, there are no facts that would result in any Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiary being commercially domiciled in any state. To the knowledge of Meadowbrook, none of Meadowbrook or any Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiary, or any of their respective Affiliates, (i) has purposefully engaged in, or colluded with or assisted any other Persons with, the paying of contingent commissions or similar incentive payments to steer business to them or colluded with Agents or brokers or other producers or intermediaries to "rig bids" or submit false quotes to customers or (ii) is a party to any agreement that provides for any payment by or to any Person of any variable or contingent commissions or payments based upon the profitability, claims handling, sales volume or loss ratio of the business that is the subject of such agreement. Since the Applicable Date, Meadowbrook and each Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiary have made all required notices, submissions, reports or other filings under applicable Insurance Law, including 

    ##### 

  

    

insurance holding company statutes, except for any such failures or instances
of noncompliance that would not reasonably be likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Meadowbrook Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (d) Neither Meadowbrook nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order issued by, or is a party to any Regulatory Agreement with, any regulatory agency or other Governmental Entity that restricts the conduct of its business or that in any manner relates to its capital adequacy, its underwriting policies, its management or its business, nor has ProCentury or any of its Subsidiaries been advised by any regulatory agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing or requesting any Regulatory Agreement. 

   

 (e) Except as otherwise is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Meadowbrook Material Adverse Effect, all policies, binders, slips, certificates, and other agreements of insurance, in effect as of the date hereof that are issued by the Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiaries (the "Meadowbrook Insurance Contracts") and any and all marketing materials, are, to the extent required under applicable Law, on the Forms. The Forms comply in all material respects with the Insurance Laws applicable thereto and, as to premium rates established by any Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiary which are required to be filed with or approved by insurance regulatory authorities, the rates have been so filed or approved and the premiums charged are within the amount permitted by Insurance Laws applicable thereto, except where the failure to be so filed or approved is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Meadowbrook Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (f) All reinsurance and coinsurance treaties or agreements, including retrocessional agreements, to which any Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiary is a party or under which any Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiary has any existing rights, obligations or liabilities are in full force and effect, except for such treaties or agreements the failure to be in full force and effect of which is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Meadowbrook Material Adverse Effect. Except as is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Meadowbrook Material Adverse Effect, no Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiary, or, to the knowledge of Meadowbrook, any other party to a material reinsurance or coinsurance treaty or agreement to which any Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiary is a party, is in default in any material respect as to any provision thereof, and no such agreement contains any provision providing that the other party thereto may terminate such agreement, or that such agreement will be automatically terminated, by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the knowledge of Meadowbrook, the financial condition of the other parties to any such agreement is impaired with the result that a default thereunder may reasonably be anticipated, whether or not such default may be cured by the operation of any offset clause in such agreement, that is, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Meadowbrook Material Adverse Effect. All reinsurance and retrocession agreements to which any Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiary is a party, either as a cedent or a reinsurer or retrocessionaire, comply in all material respects with all risk transfer criteria under GAAP and applicable SAP, and to the knowledge of Meadowbrook, there is no investigation, inquiry or proceeding currently pending before or by Governmental Entity, to which Meadowbrook or any Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiary is subject, with respect to the risk transfer characteristics or 

    ##### 

  

    

the reporting or disclosure thereof, of any such reinsurance or retrocession
except any such investigation, inquiry or proceeding which would no,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Meadowbrook
Material Adverse Effect.

The information and data furnished by any Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiary to its actuaries in connection with the preparation of the Meadowbrook Actuarial Analyses were accurate in all material respects. The aggregate reserves for claims, losses (including, without limitation, incurred but not reported losses), loss adjustment expenses (whether allocated or unallocated) and unearned premium, as reflected in each of the Meadowbrook SAP Statements, (i) were determined in accordance with presently accepted actuarial standards consistently applied (except as otherwise noted in the financial statements and notes thereto included in such financial statements), (ii) are fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial principles, (iii) were computed on the basis of methodologies consistent in all material respects with those used in computing the corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal years (except as otherwise noted in the financial statements and notes thereto included in such financial statements) and (iv) include provisions for all actuarial reserves and related items which ought to be established in accordance with applicable Laws.

As of the date hereof, Meadowbrook and each of the Meadowbrook Insurance Subsidiaries have been assigned an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating by A.M. Best Company.

 5.22 _Insurance_.

The board of directors of Meadowbrook shall at all times prior to and during such meeting recommend such approval and shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit such approval by its shareholders; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the board of directors of Meadowbrook from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation if the board of directors of Meadowbrook determines, after consultation with its outside counsel, that such action is legally required in order for the directors to comply with their fiduciary duties to the Meadowbrook shareholders under applicable Law. 

   

 7.3 _Registration Statement_. 

  

 (a) Meadowbrook agrees to prepare an S-4 or other applicable registration statement to be filed by Meadowbrook with the SEC in connection with the issuance of Meadowbrook Common Stock in the Merger (including the Proxy Statement and other proxy solicitation materials of ProCentury and Meadowbrook constituting a part thereof and all related documents). ProCentury shall prepare and furnish such information relating to it and its directors, officers and shareholders as may be reasonably required in connection with the above referenced documents based on its knowledge of and access to the information required for said documents, and ProCentury, and its legal, financial and accounting advisors, shall have the right to review and approve (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) the S-4 prior to its filing. ProCentury agrees to cooperate with Meadowbrook and Merger Sub and Meadowbrooks and Merger Subs counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its financial advisor and independent auditor in connection with the S-4 and the Proxy Statement. Provided that ProCentury has cooperated as described above, Meadowbrook agrees to file, or cause to be filed, the S-4 with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of ProCentury, Meadowbrook and Merger Sub agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the S-4 to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. Meadowbrook also agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, ProCentury and Meadowbrook shall promptly mail the Proxy Statement to their respective shareholders. 

   

 (b) Each of ProCentury and Meadowbrook agrees that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4 shall, at the time the S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) 

    ##### 

  

    

the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto shall, at the
date(s) of mailing to shareholders and at the time of the ProCentury
Shareholder Meeting and the Meadowbrook Shareholder Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading. Each of ProCentury and Meadowbrook further agrees that if such
Party shall become aware prior to the Effective Time of any information
furnished by such Party that would cause any of the statements in the S-4 or
the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other
Parties thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the S-4 or the
Proxy Statement. 

   

 (c) Meadowbrook agrees to advise ProCentury, promptly after Meadowbrook receives notice thereof, of the time when the S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Meadowbrook Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent Meadowbrook is aware thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the S-4 or for additional information. 

   

 7.4 _Regulatory Filings_. 

  

 (a) Each of Meadowbrook, Merger Sub and ProCentury shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and any initial filings with Governmental Entities shall be made by Meadowbrook and Merger Sub as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement. Each of Meadowbrook, Merger Sub and ProCentury shall have the right to review and approve (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and to the extent practicable each shall consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger. In exercising the foregoing right, each of such Parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each Party agrees that it shall consult with the other Parties with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger, and each Party shall keep the other Parties apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the Merger.

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any of the Parties be obligated to take any action, including divesting or holding separate any assets, in order to obtain any consent, waiver, approval or authorization relating to, or to resolve any objections to the transactions contemplated hereby, asserted by any Governmental Entity. 

   

 (f) Each Party shall promptly inform the other party in advance of any proposed meetings, discussions or other material communications with the Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated hereby (and as soon as practicable following any communication from any such entity).

ProCentury shall not issue any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement or make any such public statements without the prior written consent of Meadowbrook and Merger Sub, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that ProCentury may, without the prior consent of Meadowbrook or Merger Sub (but after consultation with Meadowbrook and Merger Sub, to the extent practicable under the circumstances), issue such press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by Law or the rules or regulations of Nasdaq. ProCentury, Merger Sub and Meadowbrook shall cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management available at presentations 

   ##### 

  

    

related to the Merger as reasonably requested by the other Parties. 

  

 7.6 _Access; Information_. 

  

 (a) ProCentury agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford Meadowbrook and Merger Sub and their officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives such access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties and personnel of ProCentury and to such other information relating to ProCentury as Meadowbrook may reasonably request and, during such period, it shall furnish promptly to Meadowbrook and Merger Sub all information concerning the business, properties and personnel of ProCentury as Meadowbrook and Merger Sub may reasonably request, subject to applicable Law. 

   

 (b) Meadowbrook and Merger Sub agree that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, they shall afford ProCentury and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives such access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties and personnel of Meadowbrook and Merger Sub and to such other information relating to Meadowbrook and Merger Sub as ProCentury may reasonably request and, during such period, they shall furnish promptly to ProCentury all information concerning the business, properties and personnel of Meadowbrook and Merger Sub as ProCentury may reasonably request, subject to applicable Law. 

   

 (c) No investigation by any Party of the business and affairs of any other Party shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to any Partys obligation to consummate the Merger. 

   

 7.7 _Acquisition Proposals_. ProCentury agrees that it shall not, and that it shall cause its directors and officers not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction involving ProCentury, or any purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of ProCentury or more than 20% of the outstanding equity securities of ProCentury (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"). ProCentury further agrees that it shall not, and that it shall cause its directors and officers not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent ProCentury or the board of directors of ProCentury from (A) complying with its disclosure obligations under federal or state Law; (B) providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the board of directors of ProCentury receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement; 

   ##### 

  

    

(C) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made
an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal or (D) recommending
such an Acquisition Proposal to the shareholders of ProCentury, if and only to
the extent that, in each such case referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D)
above, (i) the ProCentury board of directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law and (ii) the ProCentury board of directors determines in
good faith (after receipt of advice of its financial advisor) that such
Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated,
taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal and could reasonably be expected,
if consummated, to result in a transaction more favorable to ProCenturys
shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger. An Acquisition
Proposal which is received and considered by the ProCentury in compliance
with this Section 7.7 and which meets the requirements set forth in clause
(D) of the preceding sentence is herein referred to as a "Superior
Proposal." ProCentury agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposals.
ProCentury agrees that it will notify Meadowbrook and Merger Sub if any such
inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, ProCentury or any of its representatives. 

  

 7.8 _NYSE Listing_. Meadowbrook agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective Time, on the NYSE the shares of Meadowbrook Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger. 

  

 7.9 _Benefit Plans_. 

  

 (a) Meadowbrook shall take all commercially reasonable action so that either contemporaneously with or as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, employees of ProCentury and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time will be eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans of Meadowbrook on substantially the same terms and conditions of similarly situated employees of Meadowbrook. Except as provided elsewhere in this Section 7.9(a) and in Section 7.9(b), nothing in this Agreement shall require that Meadowbrook or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, continue the ProCentury Plans or shall limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any of ProCenturys Plans in accordance with their terms at any time. On or before the Effective Time, if directed in writing to do so by Meadowbrook, ProCentury shall take or cause to be taken all such action necessary to terminate the Century Surety Company 401(k) Plan ("Century 401(k) Plan") and, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective date of the termination, file an application for a favorable determination of the qualified status of the ProCentury 401(k) Plan upon its termination; provided, however, ProCentury shall not be obligated to take any such requested action that is irrevocable until immediately prior to the Effective Time. Meadowbrook shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to permit any outstanding participant loans under the Century 401(k) Plan of employees of ProCentury and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to be transferred to a 401(k) plan maintained by Meadowbrook or its Subsidiaries (the "Meadowbrook 401(k) Plan") prior to the date that such loans would go into a default status under the Century 401(k) Plan. As soon as reasonably practicable following the termination of 

    ##### 

  

    

the Century 401(k) Plan and the issuance of a favorable determination letter
by the Internal Revenue Service confirming the qualified status of the
Century 401(k) Plan upon its termination, the participants in the
Century 401(k) Plan who are employees of the Surviving Corporation or
Meadowbrook or its Subsidiaries shall be eligible to roll over their account
balances, including any outstanding participant loans, into the Meadowbrook
401(k) Plan. All employees of ProCentury and its Subsidiaries shall be
eligible to participate in the Meadowbrook 401(k) Plan as of the Effective
Time; provided that such employees were, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, eligible to participate in the Century 401(k) Plan and had reached
their Entry Date (as defined in the Century 401(k) Plan). Employees of
ProCentury and its Subsidiaries who, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
had not reached their Entry Date (as defined in the Century 401(k) Plan),
shall be eligible to participate in the Meadowbrook 401(k) Plan as of their
Entry Date (as defined in the Meadowbrook 401(k) Plan), taking into account
such employees service with both ProCentury and its Subsidiaries and
Meadowbrook and its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (b) At and following the Effective Time, Meadowbrook and the Surviving Corporation shall honor, and the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all contractual rights of current and former employees of ProCentury existing as of the Effective Time, and all employment, "change-in-control", deferred compensation and incentive compensation agreements of ProCentury and its Subsidiaries, in each case, which are Previously Disclosed. 

   

 (c) For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for benefit accruals) under the employee benefit plans of Meadowbrook and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any employees of ProCentury and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, each such employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with ProCentury and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar ProCentury Plan in which such employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. At such time as employees of ProCentury become eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Meadowbrook or its Subsidiaries, Meadowbrook shall cause each such plan to (i) provide full credit under such plans for any deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees of ProCentury and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such participation as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such plan of Meadowbrook or its Subsidiaries and (ii) waive any waiting period limitation, evidence of insurability or actively-at-work requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous ProCentury Plan. The Surviving Corporation shall assume full responsibility for providing COBRA continuation coverage to current and former ProCentury employees who are MandA Qualified Beneficiaries as the term is defined in Treas. Reg. §§ 54.4980B-1  B-10 until such time as the Surviving Corporation terminates its own health plan or plans. Nothing in this Section 7.9(c) shall prevent Meadowbrook or the Surviving Corporation from terminating its group health plan or plans. On or before the Effective Time, if directed in writing to do so by Meadowbrook, ProCentury shall take or cause to be taken all such 

    ##### 

  

    

action necessary to terminate some or all of ProCenturys Plans that are
welfare benefit plans; provided, however, ProCentury shall not be obligated
to take any such requested action that is irrevocable until immediately prior
to the Effective Time. All employees of ProCentury and its Subsidiaries shall
be eligible to participate in Meadowbrooks welfare benefit plans as of the
Effective Time. 

   

 7.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of ProCentury, Merger Sub and Meadowbrook shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it and its respective Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein. 

  

 7.11 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Meadowbrook shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, jointly and severally, honor all of ProCenturys and its Subsidiaries obligations to indemnify (including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) the current and former directors and officers of ProCentury and its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party") for acts or omissions by such Indemnified Parties occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such obligations of ProCentury and such Subsidiaries exist on the date hereof, whether pursuant to articles of incorporation, code of regulations, bylaws of ProCentury or its Subsidiaries or pursuant to such indemnity agreements as are disclosed in Section 7.11 of the ProCentury Disclosure Schedule, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof. 

   

 (b) Meadowbrook will obtain, fully pay for and maintain for six years A-Side coverage including Difference in Conditions coverage ("DIC") drop down, reasonably acceptable to ProCentury, with a prior and pending/ retroactive date of March 19, 2007 for the DIC coverage and March 19, 2004 for the main coverage grant, which provides substantially the same amounts and scope of coverage as are provided under ProCenturys existing policies; provided, however, that if the aggregate premium for the foregoing coverage is greater than $1,000,000, such insurance shall be reduced in scope, amount or duration (at ProCenturys option) to insurance coverage the premium for which equals $1,000,000 in the aggregate.  

   

 (c) If an Indemnified Party prevails in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 7.11, Meadowbrook shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the Indemnified Party in such enforcement. 

   

 (d) If Meadowbrook or the Surviving Corporation (A) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.11. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the articles of incorporation, code of regulations, bylaws or other organizational documents of ProCentury or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the Ohio Revised Code or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 7.11 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

   

 7.12 _Financing_. Meadowbrook and Merger Sub shall take all action that is necessary so that at the Effective Time Meadowbrook and Merger Sub have sufficient cash and cash equivalents and available amounts under then-existing credit facilities to pay the Maximum Cash Consideration and all related fees and expenses payable by Meadowbrook and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 7.13 _Current Information_. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, each of ProCentury, on the one hand, and Meadowbrook and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will cause one or more of its designated representatives to notify on a regular and frequent basis (not less than monthly) representatives of Meadowbrook or ProCentury, as the case may be, and to report (i) the general status of the ongoing operations of it and its Subsidiaries; and (ii) the status of, and the action proposed to be taken with respect to, any matters outside the ordinary course of its and its Subsidiaries businesses. Each of ProCentury, on the one hand, and Meadowbrook and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will promptly notify the other of any material change in the normal course of business or in the operation of its properties or the properties of any of its Subsidiaries and all regulatory communications and governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the threat of significant litigation involving itself or any of its Subsidiaries, and will keep the other fully informed of such events. 

  

 7.14 _Continuing Directors_. Meadowbrook shall take such actions as may be required to appoint, effective as of the Effective Time, two Persons currently serving on the ProCentury board of directors (the "ProCentury Directors"), as designated by ProCentury, to the board of directors of Meadowbrook.

 (a) _Mutual Consent_. By mutual consent of ProCentury and Meadowbrook in a written instrument, if the board of directors of each so determines by a majority vote of the members of its entire Board; 

   

 (b) _No Regulatory Approval_. By either Meadowbrook or ProCentury upon written notice to the other Party (i) twenty (20) business days after the date on which any request or application for a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the request or recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such Requisite Regulatory Approval, unless within the twenty (20) business day period following such denial or withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an amended application has been filed with the applicable Governmental Entity; provided, however, that no Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b)(i) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to the failure of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such Party set forth herein; (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) there shall be a Burdensome Condition upon Meadowbrook, Merger Sub or ProCentury; 

   

 (c) _Delay_. By either Meadowbrook or ProCentury if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before September 30, 2008 (the "Drop Dead Date"), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the Party (including Merger Sub with respect to a termination by Meadowbrook) seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such Party set forth herein; provided, however that if Meadowbrook or ProCentury determines that additional time is necessary to forestall any action to restrain, enjoin or prohibit the Merger by any Governmental Entity, the Drop Dead Date may be extended to a date not later than December 31, 2008; 

   

 (d) _ProCentury Shareholder Approval_. By either Meadowbrook or ProCentury (provided that if ProCentury is the terminating Party it shall not be in material breach of any of its obligations under Section 7.2(a)) if any approval of the shareholders of ProCentury required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the ProCentury Shareholder Meeting; 

   

 (e) _Meadowbrook Shareholder Approval_. By either Meadowbrook or ProCentury (provided that if Meadowbrook is the terminating Party it shall not be in material breach of any of its obligations under Section 7.2(b)) if any approval of the shareholders of Meadowbrook required for the consummation of the Merger and issuance of Meadowbrook Common Stock in connection therewith shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the Meadowbrook Shareholder Meeting; 

   

 (f) _Breach of Representations; Material Adverse Effect_. By either Meadowbrook or ProCentury (provided that the terminating Party (including Merger Sub with respect to a termination by Meadowbrook) is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other Party 

    ##### 

  

    

(including Merger Sub with respect to a termination by ProCentury), which
breach would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Meadowbrook Material Adverse Effect or ProCentury
Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (g) _Breach of Covenants; Material Adverse Effect_. By either Meadowbrook or ProCentury (provided that the terminating Party (including Merger Sub with respect to a termination by Meadowbrook) is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other Party (including Merger Sub with respect to a termination by ProCentury), which breach would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Meadowbrook Material Adverse Effect or ProCentury Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (h) _ProCentury Failure to Recommend_. By Meadowbrook, if (i) the board of directors of ProCentury does not recommend in the Proxy Statement that its shareholders adopt this Agreement; (ii) after recommending in the Proxy Statement that shareholders adopt this Agreement, the board of directors shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation adverse to the interest of Meadowbrook or (iii) ProCentury fails to call, give proper notice of, convene and hold the ProCentury Shareholder Meeting; 

   

 (i) _Meadowbrook Failure to Recommend_. By ProCentury, if (i) the board of directors of Meadowbrook does not recommend in the Proxy Statement that its shareholders adopt this Agreement or approve the issuance of the Meadowbrook Common Stock in connection with the Merger; (ii) after recommending in the Proxy Statement that shareholders approve this Agreement or the issuance of the Meadowbrook Common Stock in connection with the Merger, the board of directors shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation adverse to the interest of ProCentury or (iii) Meadowbrook fails to call, give proper notice of, convene and hold the Meadowbrook Shareholder Meeting. 

   

 (j) _Superior Proposal_. At any time prior to the ProCentury Shareholder Meeting, by ProCentury in order to enter into an acquisition agreement or similar agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") with respect to a Superior Proposal which has been received and considered by ProCentury and the board of directors of ProCentury is in full compliance with all of the requirements of Section 7.7; provided, however, that this Agreement may be terminated by ProCentury pursuant to this Section 9.1(j) only after the tenth business day following ProCenturys provision of written notice to Meadowbrook advising Meadowbrook that the board of directors of ProCentury is prepared to accept a Superior Proposal, and only if, during such ten-business day period, Meadowbrook does not, in its sole discretion, make an offer to ProCentury that the board of directors of ProCentury determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, is at least as favorable as the Superior Proposal. 

   

 (k) _Governmental Orders_. By either Meadowbrook or ProCentury if a Governmental Entity shall have issued or entered a judgment, order, injunction or decree or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such judgment, order, injunction or decree or any other action shall have become final and non-appealable; provided, that the Party seeking to terminate this 

    ##### 

  

    

Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(k) shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to have such injunction lifted; or 

   

 (l) _Certain Tender or Exchange Offers_. By Meadowbrook if a tender offer or exchange offer for 50% or more of the outstanding shares of ProCentury Common Stock is commenced (other than by Meadowbrook or a Subsidiary thereof), and the ProCentury board of directors recommends that the shareholders of ProCentury tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer within the ten-business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act. 

   

 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. 

  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article IX, no Party to this Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation to any other Party hereunder except (i) as set forth in this Section 9.2, Section 10.2 and 10.3, (ii) that termination will not relieve a breaching Party from liability for any willful breach of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty of this Agreement giving rise to such termination and (iii) that in the event of a termination by ProCentury (so long as ProCentury is not in material breach of this Agreement), ProCentury shall be entitled to pursue any and all of its remedies, including on behalf of its shareholders, for any breach by Meadowbrook of Section 5.23 or Section 7.12. 

   

 (b) In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone by Meadowbrook while structuring and pursuing the Merger, the Parties agree that ProCentury shall pay to Meadowbrook a termination fee of $9.5 million (the "Termination Fee") in the manner set forth below if: 

   

 (i) this Agreement is terminated by Meadowbrook pursuant to Section 9.1(h) or (l); or 

   

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by (A) Meadowbrook pursuant to Section 9.1(c) (but only if the failure of the Closing to occur by the Drop Dead Date is caused by a material breach of this Agreement by ProCentury, or (B) either Meadowbrook or ProCentury pursuant to Section 9.1(d) (other than by reason of any breach by Meadowbrook), and in the case of any termination pursuant to the clauses set forth in (A) or (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated or made known to the ProCentury board of directors or any of its members (or any Person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made known an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote of the shareholders of ProCentury contemplated by this Agreement at the ProCentury Shareholder Meeting, in the case of clause (B), or the date of termination of this Agreement, in the case of clause (A); or 

   

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by ProCentury pursuant to Section 9.1(j). 

    ##### 

  

    

In the event the Termination Fee shall become payable pursuant to this Section
9.2(b), the Termination Fee shall be paid within five days following the date
of termination of this Agreement. Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to
this Section 9.2(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Meadowbrook. 

   

 (c) ProCentury and Meadowbrook agree that the agreement contained in Sections 9.2(b) and (c) hereof is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreement Meadowbrook would not have entered into this Agreement and that such amounts constitute liquidated damages, but not a penalty, in the event of a breach of this Agreement by ProCentury. If ProCentury fails to pay Meadowbrook the amounts due under paragraph (b) above within the time periods specified therein, ProCentury shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Meadowbrook in connection with any action in which Meadowbrook prevails, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment. 

   

 9.3 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other Parties contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 

  

ARTICLE X 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS 

   

 10.1 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the Parties, which shall be the first day which is at least two business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than such conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied on the Closing Date) but in no event earlier than the 11th day following the ProCentury Shareholder Meeting (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Meadowbrooks counsel unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the Parties. 

  

 10.2 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time (except for those covenants and agreements contained herein and therein which by their terms apply in whole or in part after the Effective Time) or the termination of this Agreement if this Agreement is 

   ##### 

  

    

terminated prior to the Effective Time (other than Sections 9.1, 9.2 and this
Article X, which shall survive any such termination). Notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing to the contrary, no representations, warranties,
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
terminated or extinguished so as to deprive any Party or any of their
affiliates of any defense at Law or in equity which otherwise would be
available against the claims of any Person. 

  

 10.3 _Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 7.4(g) and as costs and expenses may be payable pursuant to Section 9.2, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, accountants and counsel shall be paid by the Party incurring such expense; provided, however, that all filing and other fees paid to the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated thereby shall be borne by Meadowbrook, provided, further, however, that nothing contained herein shall limit any Partys rights to recover any liabilities or damages arising out of another Partys willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 10.5 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

Whenever the words "include," "includes" or including are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

 10.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 30, 2007, between ProCentury and Meadowbrook. 

  

 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Ohio without regard to conflicts-of-law principles that would require the application of any other Law. 

  

 10.8 _Enforcement of the Agreement_ . The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. 

  

 10.9 _Severability_. Except to the extent that application of this Section 10.9 would have a Material Adverse Effect on ProCentury or Meadowbrook and their respective Subsidiaries taken as a whole, any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. In all 

   ##### 

  

    

such cases, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute
a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as practicable,
implements the original purposes and intents of this Agreement. 

  

 10.10 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after adoption of the Agreement by the shareholders of either ProCentury or Meadowbrook; provided, however, that after adoption of the Agreement by ProCenturys shareholders, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to ProCentury shareholders hereunder other than as contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise required by applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties. 

  

 10.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 10.12 _Execution of Agreement_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been executed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the Parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the Parties transmitted by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to be their original signatures for all purposes. 

  

 10.13 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_ Except as set forth in Section 7.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement.
