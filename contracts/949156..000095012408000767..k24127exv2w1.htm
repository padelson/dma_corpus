that a holder of a ProCentury Option may exercise the ProCentury Option and complete an Election
Form conditioned on consummation of the Merger so that if the Merger is not completed the
ProCentury Options will remain subject to their respective original vesting schedules. In the
event of any such conditional exercise and election, all ProCentury Common Shares underlying such
exercised ProCentury Options will be deemed to have been issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time for purposes of Section&nbsp;3.1. If a holder of a ProCentury Option so elects
and executes an appropriate acknowledgement or waiver, a ProCentury Option may be canceled in
exchange for the right to receive from Meadowbrook a single lump cash payment, equal to the product
of (i)&nbsp;the number of ProCentury Common Shares subject to such ProCentury Option immediately prior

any, of the Per Share Cash Consideration over the exercise price per share of such ProCentury

Material Adverse Effect.
