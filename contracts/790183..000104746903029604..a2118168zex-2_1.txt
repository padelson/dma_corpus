                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 27, 2003 (this
"Agreement"), is entered into by and between FleetBoston Financial Corporation
("FleetBoston"), a Rhode Island corporation, and Progress Financial Corporation
("Progress"), a Delaware corporation.

         WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of FleetBoston and Progress have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for
herein in which Progress, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
will combine in a merger (the "Merger") with and into FleetBoston, with
FleetBoston being the Surviving Corporation (as defined in Section 1.1);

         WHEREAS, prior to the consummation of the Merger, FleetBoston and
Progress will respectively cause their subsidiaries, Fleet National Bank ("Fleet
National Bank"), a national banking association and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
FleetBoston, and Progress Bank ("Progress Bank"), a federally-chartered savings
bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Progress, to enter into a merger
agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Bank Merger
Agreement"), providing for the merger (the "Bank Merger") of Progress Bank with
and into Fleet National Bank, and it is intended that the Bank Merger be
consummated immediately following the consummation of the Merger; and

         WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

         1.1      THE MERGER AND THE BANK MERGER.

                  (a)      Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Rhode Island Business Corporation Act (the
"RIBCA") and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), Progress shall merge into FleetBoston,
with FleetBoston being the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes called
the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
corporate existence of Progress shall cease and the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to exist as a Rhode Island corporation.

                  (b)      Immediately following the Merger, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, and in
accordance with applicable law, Progress Bank shall merge with and into Fleet
National Bank, with Fleet National Bank being the surviving bank in the Bank
Merger (hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving Bank").


<Page>


Upon consummation of the Bank Merger, the separate existence of Progress Bank
shall cease and the Surviving Bank shall continue to exist as a national banking
association.

         1.2      EFFECTIVE TIME.

         The Merger shall become effective, as set forth in the certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") that shall be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and the articles of merger (the "Articles of
Merger") that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Rhode
Island on the Closing Date. The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time
when the Merger becomes effective on the Closing Date, as set forth in the
Certificate of Merger and the Articles of Merger.

         1.3      EFFECTS OF THE MERGER.

         At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Sections 259 and 261 of the DGCL and Section 7.1.1-69 of the RIBCA.

         1.4      CONVERSION OF PROGRESS COMMON STOCK.

                  (a)      At the Effective Time, subject to Sections 1.4(b),
1.4(c) and 1.4(d) hereof, each share of Progress common stock, par value $1.00
per share ("Progress Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive the
number of shares of FleetBoston common stock, par value $.01 per share (together
with the preferred stock purchase rights (the "FleetBoston Stockholder Rights")
attached thereto pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of August 16, 2000,
between FleetBoston and Equiserve, LP, as Rights Agent (the "FleetBoston Rights
Agreement"), the "FleetBoston Common Stock") equal to the following ratio (the
"Exchange Ratio"): the quotient (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth) of (x)
$28.00, divided by (y) the Starting Price (as defined in Section 9.13),
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that

                          (i)     if the Average Closing Price (as defined in
         Section 9.13) shall be more than 10 percent above the Starting Price,
         then the Exchange Ratio shall equal the quotient (rounded to the
         nearest ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing (a) $30.80 by (b) the
         Average Closing Price; or

                          (ii)    if the Average Closing Price shall be more
         than 10 percent below the Starting Price, then the Exchange Ratio shall
         equal the quotient (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth) obtained by
         dividing (x) $25.20 by (y) the Average Closing Price.

The Stock Consideration, together with the cash paid in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.4(d), is referred to herein collectively as the
"Merger Consideration."

                  (b)      All of the shares of Progress Common Stock converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each certificate previously representing any such shares of


                                      -2-
<Page>


Progress Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall thereafter represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. If prior to the Effective Time, (i)
the outstanding shares of FleetBoston Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in
capitalization, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made to the
Merger Consideration and the Exchange Ratio, as applicable, or (ii) the
FleetBoston Stockholder Rights shall have been separated from the FleetBoston
Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the FleetBoston Rights Agreement,
appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Merger Consideration to ensure that
former Progress shareholders receive such FleetBoston Stockholder Rights.

                  (c)       At the Effective Time, all shares of Progress Common
Stock that are owned by Progress as treasury stock and all shares of Progress
Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by FleetBoston or Progress or
any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than shares of Progress Common Stock
(x) held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like
or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of third parties (any
such shares, and shares of FleetBoston Common Stock which are similarly held,
whether held directly or indirectly by FleetBoston or Progress, as the case may
be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares") or (y) held by
FleetBoston or Progress or any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a
debt previously contracted (any such shares of Progress Common Stock, and shares
of FleetBoston Common Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or
indirectly by FleetBoston or Progress, being referred to herein as "DPC
Shares")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of
FleetBoston, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. All shares of FleetBoston Common Stock that are owned by Progress or
any Progress Subsidiary (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall
become treasury stock of FleetBoston.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fraction of a share of FleetBoston Common Stock will be issued.
Instead, FleetBoston shall pay to each holder of Progress Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of FleetBoston Common Stock an
amount in cash equal to (i) the fraction of a share of FleetBoston Common Stock
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, multiplied by (ii) the actual
market value of FleetBoston Common Stock, which shall be deemed to be the
average of the daily closing prices per share for FleetBoston Common Stock for
the 10 consecutive trading days on which shares of FleetBoston Common Stock are
actually traded (as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE"))
beginning on the 12th trading day and ending on the third trading day preceding
the Closing Date, inclusive. Following consummation of the Merger, no holder of
Progress Common Stock shall be entitled to dividends or any other rights in
respect of any such fraction.

         1.5      OPTIONS; RESTRICTED STOCK.

                  (a)      At the Effective Time, each option granted by
Progress to purchase shares of Progress Common Stock that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior thereto shall cease to represent a right to
acquire shares of Progress Common Stock and shall be converted


                                      -3-
<Page>


automatically into an option to purchase shares of FleetBoston Common Stock in
an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise
subject to the terms of, as the case may be, the Progress 2000 Incentive Stock
Option Plan, as amended, the Progress 1993 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and
the Progress 1993 Directors' Stock Incentive Plan, as amended) (collectively,
the "Progress Stock Plans"), and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder):

                           (i)     the number of shares of FleetBoston Common
         Stock to be subject to each new option shall be equal to the product of
         the number of shares of Progress Common Stock subject to the original
         option and the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of
         FleetBoston Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be
         rounded down to the nearest whole share;

                           (ii)    the exercise price per share of FleetBoston
         Common Stock under the new option shall be equal to the exercise price
         per share of Progress Common Stock under the original option divided by
         the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded
         up to the nearest whole cent; and

                           (iii)   the duration and other terms of each new
         option shall be the same as the original option except that all
         references to Progress shall be deemed to be references to FleetBoston.

                  (b)      The adjustment provided herein with respect to any
options that are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code) shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent
with Section 424(a) of the Code. The duration and other terms of the new option
shall be the same as the original option except that all references to Progress
shall be deemed to be references to FleetBoston.

                  (c)      FleetBoston shall take all corporate action necessary
to reserve for issuance of a sufficient number of shares of FleetBoston Common
Stock for delivery upon exercise of options to purchase Progress Common Stock,
as adjusted in accordance with this Section 1.5. Within five business days after
the Effective Time, FleetBoston shall file a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of
FleetBoston Common Stock subject to such options and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the related
prospectus or prospectuses) for so long as such options remain outstanding.

                  (d)      FleetBoston agrees that, at the Effective Time, each
restricted share of Progress Common Stock granted by Progress under the Progress
Restricted Stock Award Plan (the "Progress Restricted Stock") which is unvested
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become
free of any restrictions to which they are subject under the Progress Restricted
Stock Award Plan.

         1.6      FLEETBOSTON COMMON STOCK.

         Except for shares of FleetBoston Common Stock owned by Progress or any
Progress Subsidiary (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares), which
shall be converted into treasury stock of FleetBoston as contemplated by Section
1.4(c) hereof, the shares of FleetBoston Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unaffected by the Merger and
such shares shall remain issued and outstanding.


         1.7      ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION.

         At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of FleetBoston, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

         2.2      EXCHANGE.

                  (a)   As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but no
later than five business days after the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a form letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form for transactions such as the
Merger and which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange
therefor, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of
FleetBoston Common Stock to which such holder of Progress Common Stock shall
have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I hereof, and (ii) a
check representing the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of fractional
shares, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Article I. The Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional
shares and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of
Certificates.

                  (b)   No dividends or other distributions declared after the
Effective Time with respect to FleetBoston Common Stock and payable to the
holders of record thereof shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in
accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon,
which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of FleetBoston
Common Stock represented by such Certificate. No holder of an unsurrendered
Certificate shall be entitled, until the surrender of such Certificate, to vote
the shares of FleetBoston Common Stock into which such holder's Progress Common
Stock shall have been converted.

                  (c)   If any certificate representing shares of FleetBoston
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
(or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay
to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of FleetBoston Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

                  (d)   As of the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of Progress of the shares of Progress Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II.

<Page>


                  (e)   Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed
by the shareholders of Progress six months after the Effective Time will be
returned to FleetBoston. After such funds have been returned to FleetBoston, any
shareholders of Progress who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to FleetBoston for payment of the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Progress Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
FleetBoston, Progress, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to
any former holder of shares of Progress Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

                  (f)   In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
FleetBoston, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as FleetBoston
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate both a stock certificate and a check
representing the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

has received a written notice of, and otherwise has no Knowledge of any, default
or termination with respect to any of the Leases. There has not occurred any
event and no condition exists that, would constitute a termination event or a
material breach by Progress or any Progress Subsidiary of, or material default
by Progress or any Progress Subsidiary in, the performance of any covenant,
agreement or condition contained in any Lease, and to Knowledge of Progress, no
lessor under a Lease is in material breach or default in the performance of any
material covenant, agreement or condition contained in such Lease. Progress and
the Progress Subsidiaries have paid all rents and other charges to the extent
due under the Leases.

         3.17     INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

                  (a)   Progress and the Progress Subsidiaries own or have a
valid license to use all Progress Intellectual Property (as defined below), free
and clear of all Liens, royalty or other payment obligations (except for
royalties or payments with respect to off-the-shelf Software at standard
commercial rates). Progress Intellectual Property constitutes all of the
Intellectual Property necessary to carry on the business of Progress and the
Progress Subsidiaries as currently conducted. Progress Intellectual Property
owned by Progress or any Progress Subsidiary, and to the Knowledge of Progress,
all other Progress Intellectual Property, is valid and enforceable and has not
been cancelled, forfeited, expired or abandoned, and neither Progress nor any
Progress Subsidiary has received notice challenging the validity or
enforceability of the Progress Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of
Progress, the conduct of the business of Progress and the Progress Subsidiaries
does not violate, misappropriate or infringe upon the Intellectual Property
rights of any third party. The consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger
will not result in the loss or impairment of the right of Progress or any
Progress Subsidiary to own or use any of Progress Intellectual Property, and
FleetBoston will have substantially the same rights to own or use Progress
Intellectual Property following the consummation of the Merger and the Bank
Merger as Progress and the Progress Subsidiaries had prior to the consummation
of the Merger and the Bank Merger, provided that consents identified in Section
3.17(a) of the Progress Disclosure Schedule are obtained.

                  (b)   For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Intellectual
Property" means (i) trademarks, service marks, trade names, Internet domain
names, designs, logos, slogans, and general intangibles of like nature, together
with all goodwill, registrations and applications related to the foregoing both
domestically and internationally; (ii) patents and industrial designs both
domestically and internationally (including any continuations, divisionals,
continuations-in-part, renewals, reissues, and applications for any of the
foregoing); (iii) copyrights both domestically and internationally (including
any common law copyrights, registrations and applications for any of the
foregoing); (iv) computer programs, whether in source code or object code form
(including any and all software implementation of algorithms, models and
methodologies), databases and compilations (including any and all data and
collections of data),


                                      -22-

and all documentation (including user manuals and training materials) related to
the foregoing (collectively, "Software"); and (v) technology, trade secrets and
other confidential information, know-how, proprietary processes, formulae,
algorithms, models, and methodologies both domestically and internationally. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Progress Intellectual Property" means the
Intellectual Property used in or held for use in the conduct of the business of
Progress or any Progress Subsidiary.

correct and complete list of all insurance policies and bonds maintained by
Progress and any Progress Subsidiary (other than credit-life insurance),
including the name of the insurer, the policy number, the type of policy and any
applicable deductibles, and all such insurance policies and bonds are in full
force and effect. As of the date hereof, neither Progress nor any Progress
Subsidiary has received any notice of cancellation or amendment of any such
policy or bond or is in default under any such policy or bond, no coverage
thereunder is being disputed and all material claims thereunder have been filed
in a timely fashion. The existing insurance carried by Progress and Progress
Subsidiaries is and will continue to be, in respect of the nature of the risks
insured against and the amount of coverage provided, sufficient for compliance
by Progress and the Progress Subsidiaries with all requirements of Law and
agreements to which Progress or any of the Progress Subsidiaries is subject or
is party, and is, to Progress's Knowledge, substantially similar in kind and
amount to that customarily carried by parties similarly situated that own
properties and engage in businesses substantially similar to that of Progress
and the Progress Subsidiaries. True, correct and complete copies of all such
policies and bonds reflected at Section 3.18 of the Progress Disclosure
Schedule, as in effect on the date hereof, have been delivered to FleetBoston.

         3.19     COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.

                  (a)   Each of Progress and any Progress Subsidiary has
complied in all material respects with all Laws applicable to it or to the
operation of its business. Neither Progress nor any Progress Subsidiary has
received any notice of any material alleged or threatened claim, violation, or
liability under any such Laws that has not heretofore been cured and for which
there is any remaining material liability.

                  (b)   Section 3.19(b) of the Progress Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true and complete listing of all jurisdictions in which each of the
Progress Subsidiaries is organized, qualified to do business, and/or licensed to

Knowledge of Progress any other person acting on behalf of Progress or any
Progress Subsidiary that qualifies as a financial institution under the
anti-money laundering restrictions of the United States, including without
limitation the federal Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the
rules, regulations and orders promulgated thereunder (collectively, the

with another, in any act in connection with the concealment of any currency,
securities, other proprietary interest that is the result of a felony as defined
in the Anti-Money Laundering Laws ("Unlawful Gains"), or knowingly accepted,
transported, stored, dealt in or brokered any sale, purchase or any transaction

during the past three years, implemented in all material respects such
anti-money laundering mechanisms and kept and filed all reports and other
necessary documents as required by, and otherwise complied in all material
respects with, the Anti-Money Laundering Laws. Each such financial institution

Section 326 and Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations
promulgated thereunder.

         3.20     FAIRNESS OPINION.

         Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Progress has received an

date hereof to the Closing, neither FleetBoston nor any FleetBoston Subsidiary
is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to FleetBoston's Knowledge,
threatened, legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, claims,
actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against
FleetBoston or any FleetBoston Subsidiary in which, to FleetBoston's Knowledge,
there is a reasonable probability of any material recovery against or other
Material Adverse Effect upon FleetBoston or any FleetBoston Subsidiary or which
challenge the validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement and as to which there is a reasonable
probability of success.

                  (b)   There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or
regulatory restriction (other than those of general applicability to bank
holding companies and their subsidiaries) imposed upon FleetBoston, any
FleetBoston Subsidiary, or the assets of FleetBoston or any FleetBoston
Subsidiary that would have a Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston. Neither
FleetBoston nor any FleetBoston Subsidiary has been advised of, and is not aware
of, the threat of any such action.

         4.10     TAXES AND TAX RETURNS.

         Each of FleetBoston and the FleetBoston Subsidiaries has duly filed all
federal, state, foreign and local information returns and Tax Returns required
to be filed by it on or prior to the date hereof (all such returns being
accurate and complete in all material respects) and has duly paid or made
provision for the payment of all Taxes and other governmental charges which have
been incurred or are due or claimed to be due from it by any Taxing Authority
(including, without limitation, if and to the extent applicable, those due in
respect of its properties, income, business, capital stock, deposits,
franchises, licenses, sales and payrolls) other than (i) Taxes or other
governmental charges which are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good
faith and have not been finally determined, or (ii) information returns, Tax
Returns, Taxes or other governmental charges as to which the failure to file,
pay or make provision for will not have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston. The Federal Income Tax
Returns of FleetBoston and the FleetBoston Subsidiaries have been examined by
the IRS for taxable years through December 31, 1997, and any liabilities
asserted as a result of such examination have been satisfied, or if being
contested are covered by adequate reserves. There are no material disputes
pending, or claims asserted for, Taxes or assessments upon FleetBoston or any of
the FleetBoston Subsidiaries for which FleetBoston does not have adequate
reserves. Neither FleetBoston nor any of the FleetBoston Subsidiaries is a party
to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or
among FleetBoston and the FleetBoston Subsidiaries) that could give rise to a
material change in FleetBoston's financial statements referenced in Section 4.5.

                  (a)   Each of the FleetBoston Plans (as defined below) has
been operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and applicable law, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, (b)
with respect to each FleetBoston Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the
present value of accrued benefits under such plan, based upon the actuarial
assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial report
prepared by such Plan's actuary with respect to such plan, did not, as of its
latest valuation date, exceed the then current value of the assets of such plan
allocable to such accrued benefits, (c) no liability under Title IV of ERISA has
been incurred by FleetBoston, the FleetBoston Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that
presents a risk to FleetBoston, the FleetBoston Subsidiaries or an ERISA
Affiliate of incurring a material liability thereunder, (d) all contributions or
other amounts payable by FleetBoston, the FleetBoston Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliates as of the Effective Time with respect to each FleetBoston Plan in
respect of current or prior plan years have been paid or accrued in accordance
with GAAP and Section 412 of the Code, and (e) there are no pending, or, to the
Knowledge of FleetBoston, threatened or anticipated claims or proceedings (other
than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the
FleetBoston Plans or any trusts related thereto. For purposes of this Section
4.11, the term "FleetBoston Plan" means each "welfare plan" (within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of ERISA), each "pension plan" (within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA) and each other employee benefit plan, fund, program, agreement or
arrangement, in each case that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to, or
required to be contributed to, by FleetBoston, any FleetBoston Subsidiaries or
ERISA Affiliates, all of which together with FleetBoston would be deemed a
"single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA, for the
benefit of any current or former employee of FleetBoston, any FleetBoston
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate.

         4.12     COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.

                  (a)   Each of FleetBoston and any FleetBoston Subsidiary has
complied in all material respects with all Laws applicable to it or to the
operation of its business. Neither FleetBoston nor any FleetBoston Subsidiary
has received any notice of any material alleged or threatened claim, violation,
or liability under any such Laws that has not heretofore been cured and for
which there is any remaining material liability.

                  (b)   Each of the FleetBoston Subsidiaries that is an insured
depository institution is "well-capitalized" (as that term is defined in by 12
C.F.R. Section 255.2(r)(2)(i)) and "well-managed" (as that term is defined at 12
C.F.R. 225.2(s)), and each such institution's examination rating under the
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is satisfactory or outstanding.

                  (c)   None of FleetBoston or any FleetBoston Subsidiary, or to
the Knowledge of FleetBoston any other person acting on behalf of FleetBoston or
any FleetBoston Subsidiary that qualifies as a financial institution under
Anti-Money Laundering Laws, has knowingly acted, by itself or in conjunction
with another, in any act in connection with the concealment of Unlawful Gains,
or knowingly accepted, transported, stored, dealt in or brokered any sale,


                                      -32-
<Page>


purchase or any transaction of any nature for Unlawful Gains. FleetBoston and
each FleetBoston Subsidiary that qualifies as a financial institution under the
Anti-Money Laundering Laws has, during the past three years, implemented in all
material respects such anti-money laundering mechanisms and kept and filed all
reports and other necessary documents as required by, and otherwise complied in
all material respects with, the Anti-Money Laundering Laws. Each such financial
institution has implemented an anti-money laundering program that meets the
requirements of Section 326 and Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

                  (d)   FleetBoston and each FleetBoston Subsidiary are, and
since January 1, 2000 have been, in material compliance with all applicable
federal and state privacy laws and regulations, including without limitation,
Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, and with its information security program required by 12 C.F.R. Part
364.

         4.13     CERTAIN TAX MATTERS.

         As of the date hereof, FleetBoston does not have any reason to believe
that any conditions exist that might prevent or impede the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

         4.14     ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY.

         There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings,
claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations or
remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to
impose, or that could reasonably result in the imposition, on FleetBoston of any
liability or obligation arising under common law or under any local, state or
federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance pending or, to the
Knowledge of FleetBoston, threatened against FleetBoston, which liability or
obligation will or is reasonably likely to, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston. To the Knowledge of
FleetBoston, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action
or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that
will or is reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston. FleetBoston is not subject to any
agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any
Governmental Entity or third party imposing any liability or obligation with
respect to the foregoing that will or is reasonably likely to, either
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston.

         4.15     FLEETBOSTON INFORMATION.

         The information relating to FleetBoston and the FleetBoston
Subsidiaries to be provided by FleetBoston to be contained in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (except for the portions thereof relating solely to
Progress or any Progress Subsidiary, as to which FleetBoston makes no
representation or warranty) will comply in all


                                      -33-
<Page>


material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act, Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder.

         4.16     DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

         Since July 30, 2002, FleetBoston and each FleetBoston Subsidiary has
had in place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-14(c)
and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) designed and maintained to ensure that (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's general or specific authorization, (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences, (v) all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by FleetBoston in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (vi) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to FleetBoston's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make
the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of
FleetBoston required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. None
of FleetBoston's or the FleetBoston Subsidiaries' records, systems, controls,
data or information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or otherwise
wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means (including any electronic,
mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) which
(including all means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of FleetBoston or any FleetBoston
Subsidiary or their accountants.

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         6.1      REGULATORY MATTERS.

                  (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, FleetBoston and Progress (as to information to be included therein
pertaining to Progress) shall cause to be prepared and filed with the SEC a
registration statement of FleetBoston on Form S-4, including the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (the "Registration Statement") for the purposes of
registering the FleetBoston Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, and for
soliciting the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the shareholders of
Progress. FleetBoston and Progress shall use their reasonable best efforts to
have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as
possible after the filing. The parties shall cooperate in responding to and
considering any questions or comments from the SEC staff regarding the
information contained in the Registration Statement. If at any time after the

event relating to Progress is discovered by Progress which should be set forth
in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Registration Statement, including
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, Progress shall promptly inform FleetBoston, and
shall furnish FleetBoston with all necessary information relating to such event
whereupon FleetBoston shall promptly cause an appropriate amendment to the
Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC. Upon the effectiveness of such
amendment, each of FleetBoston and Progress (if prior to the meeting of
shareholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.4 hereof) will take all necessary
action as promptly as practicable to permit an appropriate amendment or
supplement to be transmitted to its shareholders entitled to vote at such
meeting. If at any time after the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC,
and prior to the Closing Date, any event relating to FleetBoston is discovered
by FleetBoston which should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to,
the Registration Statement, including the Prospectus/Proxy Statement,
FleetBoston shall promptly inform Progress, and FleetBoston shall promptly cause
an appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC.
Upon the effectiveness of such amendment, each of FleetBoston and Progress (if
prior to


                                      -38-
<Page>


the meeting of shareholders pursuant to Section 6.4 hereof) will take all
necessary action as promptly as practicable to permit an appropriate amendment
or supplement to be transmitted to its shareholders entitled to vote at such
meeting.

                  (b)   Within 25 days after the date of this Agreement,
Progress shall furnish FleetBoston with all information about or pertaining to
Progress and the Progress Subsidiaries as is reasonably deemed by FleetBoston to
be necessary or appropriate for the preparation of the Registration Statement.
The information regarding Progress and the Progress Subsidiaries to be supplied
by Progress for inclusion in the Registration Statement will not, at the time
the Registration Statement becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

                  (c)   The information regarding FleetBoston and the
FleetBoston Subsidiaries to be supplied by FleetBoston for inclusion in the
Registration Statement will not, at the time the Registration Statement becomes
effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

                  (d)   FleetBoston also shall take any action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required to be
taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the Merger
and each of Progress and FleetBoston shall furnish all information concerning it
and the holders of its Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action.

                  (e)   Prior to the Effective Time, FleetBoston shall take such
actions as may be necessary and appropriate to effect the listing on the NYSE of
the additional shares of FleetBoston Common Stock to be issued by FleetBoston in
exchange for the shares of Progress Common Stock.

                  (f)   FleetBoston will prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including without limitation the Merger and the Bank Merger).
Progress shall cooperate with FleetBoston to effect the foregoing, and will
promptly furnish FleetBoston with all information about or pertaining to
Progress and the Progress Subsidiaries as is reasonably deemed by FleetBoston to
be necessary or appropriate for such filings. Progress and FleetBoston shall
have the right to review in advance, and will consult the other on, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to Progress or FleetBoston, as the case may be, which
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to provide either party with a right to review any information
provided to any Governmental Entity on a confidential basis in connection with
the transactions contemplated


                                      -39-

hereby. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to contemplation of the transactions contemplated herein.

                  (g)   FleetBoston and Progress shall promptly advise each
other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose
consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement which causes such party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval (defined in
Section 7.1(b) hereof) will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
approval will be materially delayed.

         6.2      NO SOLICITATION BY PROGRESS.

                  (a)   From the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time, Progress shall not, nor shall it permit any Progress Subsidiary to, nor
shall it authorize or permit any of its or any Progress Subsidiary's directors,
officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other representative retained by it or any Progress Subsidiary to,
directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance), or take
any other action designed to facilitate or that is likely to result in, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably
likely to lead to, any Competing Proposal (as defined in Section 9.13), (ii)
enter into any agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal, (iii) participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal or (iv) make
or authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any
Competing Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if, and only to the extent that, (A)
the approval of this Agreement by Progress's stockholders has not occurred and
(B) the Board of Directors of Progress determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that the failure to
do so would or could reasonably be expected to breach the fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors of Progress under applicable law, Progress may, in
response to a bona fide, written Competing Proposal not solicited in violation
of this Section 6.2(a) that the Board of Directors of Progress believes in good
faith constitutes a Superior Competing Proposal (as defined in Section 9.13),
subject to compliance with Section 6.2(b), (1) furnish information with respect
to Progress to any person making such a Superior Competing Proposal pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement (as determined by Progress after
consultation with its outside counsel) on terms no more favorable to such person
than the terms contained in any such agreement between Progress and FleetBoston,
(2) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such a Superior
Competing Proposal and (3) subject to the terms of Section 8.1(h), enter into an
acquisition agreement or similar agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement")
with respect to a Superior Competing Proposal.

                  (b)   In addition to the obligations of Progress set forth in
Section 6.2(a), Progress shall promptly advise FleetBoston orally and in writing
of any Competing Proposal (or any inquiry which could lead to a Competing
Proposal) and keep FleetBoston informed, on a


                                      -40-
<Page>


current basis, of the continuing status thereof.

         6.3      ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

                  (a)   Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws,
Progress shall accord to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives of FleetBoston, access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records and, during such period, Progress shall make available
to FleetBoston (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws and
(ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
FleetBoston may reasonably request. Progress shall promptly provide FleetBoston
with true, correct and complete copies of all financial and other information
provided to directors of Progress in connection with meetings of its Board of
Directors or committees thereof (except for materials that relate to the Merger,
this Agreement or any other matter Progress reasonably determines should be
treated as confidential). Neither Progress nor any Progress Subsidiary shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Progress's customers,
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

                  (b)   All information furnished to FleetBoston by Progress
pursuant to Section 6.3(a) shall be subject to, and FleetBoston shall hold all
such information in confidence in accordance with, the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement dated as of July 9, 2003, and the Confidentiality
Agreement dated as of August 18, 2003, between Progress and FleetBoston (the
"Confidentiality Agreements").

                  (c)   No investigation by either of the parties or their
respective representatives shall affect the representations and warranties,
covenants or agreements of the other set forth herein.

         6.4      SHAREHOLDER MEETING.

         Progress shall take all steps necessary to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders within 35 days after the
Registration Statement becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon the
approval and adoption of this Agreement (the "Special Meeting"). Progress shall,
through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders approval and
adoption of this Agreement, which provides for the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall, through its management and Board of
Directors, oppose any third party proposal or other action that is inconsistent
with this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Board of Directors of Progress
may, subject to the provisions of Section 8.1(g), withdraw, modify, condition or
refuse to make such recommendation if the Board of Directors of Progress
determines, in good faith after consultation with its outside financial and
legal advisors, that the


                                      -41-
<Page>


failure to take such action would or could reasonably be expected to breach its
fiduciary obligations under applicable law.

         6.5      LEGAL CONDITIONS TO MERGER.

         Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
FleetBoston and Progress shall use their reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly
with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party with respect to
the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to obtain
(and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other
third party which is required to be obtained by Progress or FleetBoston in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         6.6      EMPLOYEES.

                  (a)   After the Effective Time, except to the extent that
FleetBoston or the FleetBoston Subsidiaries continue Plans in effect, employees
of Progress or any of the Progress Subsidiaries who become employed by
FleetBoston or any FleetBoston Subsidiary ("Covered Employees") will be eligible
for employee benefits that FleetBoston or such subsidiary, as the case may be,
provides to its employees generally and, except as otherwise required by this
Agreement, on substantially the same basis as is applicable to such employees;
PROVIDED that nothing in this Agreement shall require any duplication of
benefits. FleetBoston will or will cause Fleet National Bank to (i) give credit
to Covered Employees (and their dependants) with respect to the satisfaction of
the limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability requirements and waiting periods for participation and coverage
that are applicable under the employee welfare benefit plans (within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of ERISA) of FleetBoston or Fleet National Bank, equal to the
credit that any such employee had received as of the Effective Time towards the
satisfaction of any such limitations and waiting periods under the comparable
employee welfare benefit plans of Progress or Progress Subsidiaries and to waive
preexisting condition limitations to the same extent waived under the
corresponding Plan. Each Covered Employee will receive credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual (but not for benefit
accrual purposes under any qualified defined benefit plan maintained by
FleetBoston), under any FleetBoston employee benefit plan, arrangement or policy
(including but not limited to vacation, sick and other leave policies) to which
such employee is eligible to participate after the Effective Time for services
accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with Progress or any
Progress Subsidiary.

                  (b)   After the Merger, FleetBoston and each of its relevant
subsidiaries will honor, without modification, and perform the obligations of
Progress under the contracts, plans and arrangements listed in Section 6.6(b) of
the Progress Disclosure Schedule. FleetBoston acknowledges and agrees that (i)
the consummation of the Merger shall constitute a "change-in-control" of
Progress for purposes of the employment, severance, change-in-control and other
compensation agreements and arrangements disclosed in the Progress Disclosure
Schedule, (ii) the persons covered by such employment and change-in-control
agreements would be entitled to


                                      -42-
<Page>


terminate their employment and receive severance benefits as of the Effective
Time, and (iii) the persons covered by employment and change-in-control
agreements shall receive severance benefits as of the Effective Time pursuant to
their agreements even if they are subsequently re-hired by FleetBoston or a
FleetBoston Subsidiary, except as set forth in Section 6.6(b) of the Progress
Disclosure Schedule.


                  (c)   FleetBoston shall pay any employee of Progress or any
Progress Subsidiary who is not otherwise covered by a specific employment,
termination, severance or change-in-control agreement and who is terminated by
FleetBoston or an affiliate of FleetBoston for a reason other than "termination
for cause" (as defined below) in the one-year period immediately following the
Effective Time, the severance and other benefits set forth below:

                           (i)    severance in an amount equal to two (2) weeks
         base salary multiplied by the number of full years of service of such
         terminated employee to Progress or any Progress Subsidiary, as
         recognized on the books of Progress or the Progress Subsidiary,
         provided that all such employees shall be entitled to receive a minimum
         severance payment of four (4) weeks and a maximum severance payment of
         twenty-six (26) weeks base salary; and

                           (ii)   out-placement services to terminated employees
         of Progress or a Progress Subsidiary consistent with FleetBoston's past
         practices.

For this purpose, "termination for cause" means the termination of an employee's
employment due to any act that is deemed inimical to the best interests of
FleetBoston or any Affiliate, including, but not limited to: (a) gross
misconduct in respect of the employee's duties for FleetBoston or any Affiliate,
(b) conviction of a felony or perpetration of a common law fraud, (c) failure to
comply with applicable laws or regulations with respect to the execution of
FleetBoston's or the Affiliate's businesses, (d) violation of FleetBoston
policies or Code of Ethics and Business Conduct or (e) theft, fraud,
embezzlement, dishonesty or other conduct that has resulted or is likely to
result in material economic or other damage to FleetBoston or any Affiliate.

                  (d)   The Progress Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the
"Progress ESOP") shall be terminated as of the Effective Time. Promptly after
the Effective Time, the trustees of the Progress ESOP shall sell a sufficient
number of shares of FleetBoston Common Stock received with respect to the
Progress Common Stock held, unallocated, in the suspense account in the Progress
ESOP such that the proceeds of such sale shall equal or exceed the then
outstanding ESOP indebtedness and shall apply the proceeds from such sale to the
payment of the ESOP indebtedness. Any remaining shares of FleetBoston Common
Stock and cash held in the suspense account after the repayment of the ESOP
indebtedness shall be allocated to the ESOP participants in accordance with the
terms of the Progress ESOP and applicable laws and regulations. In connection
with the termination of the Progress ESOP, Progress shall promptly apply to the
IRS for a favorable determination letter on the tax-qualified status of the
Progress ESOP on termination and any amendments made to the Progress ESOP in
connection with its termination or otherwise, if such amendments have not
previously received a favorable


                                      -43-
<Page>


determination letter from the IRS with respect to their qualification under Code
Section 401(a). Any amendments to the Progress ESOP requested by the IRS prior
to the Effective Time shall be adopted by Progress and Progress Bank, and any
amendments requested by the IRS after the Effective Time shall be adopted by
FleetBoston if upon advice of legal counsel to FleetBoston such amendments are
appropriate. Any and all distributions from the Progress ESOP after its
termination shall be made consistent with the aforementioned determination
letter from the IRS. The account balances of participants in the Progress ESOP
will be distributed as soon as practicable after the later of (i) the Effective
Time and (ii) the receipt of a favorable determination letter for termination of
the Progress ESOP from the IRS. Prior to the Effective Time, Progress and
Progress Bank shall make contributions to, and payments on the loan of, the
Progress ESOP consistent with past practices on regularly scheduled payment
dates.

                  (e)   Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, (i)
FleetBoston, Fleet National Bank and W. Kirk Wycoff shall enter into an
Employment Agreement, and (ii) FleetBoston, Fleet National Bank, Progress,
Progress Bank and W. Kirk Wycoff shall enter into a Termination and Release
Agreement.

         6.7      INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a)   In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in
which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, (i) a director or officer
or employee of Progress, or (ii) at the request of Progress, a director, officer
or employee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party
based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or
employee of Progress or any Progress Subsidiary or (ii) this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and
defend against and respond thereto to the extent permitted by applicable law and
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Progress as in effect on the date
hereof. It is understood and agreed that from and after the Effective Time,
FleetBoston shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law and the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of
FleetBoston as in effect on the date hereof (subject to change as required by
law), each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses
in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law
upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties
may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with
FleetBoston; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (1) FleetBoston shall have the right to
assume the defense thereof and upon such assumption FleetBoston shall not be
liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in


                                      -44-
<Page>


connection with the defense thereof, except that if FleetBoston elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises
the Indemnified Parties that there are issues that raise conflicts of interest
between FleetBoston and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to FleetBoston, and FleetBoston shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties,
(2) FleetBoston shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only
one firm of counsel in any one jurisdiction for each Indemnified Party, (3)
FleetBoston shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such settlement involves equitable relief,
FleetBoston may withhold such consent in its sole discretion), and (4)
FleetBoston shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and
if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of
such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law, or by the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws of FleetBoston.
FleetBoston shall have no obligation to advance expenses incurred in connection
with a threatened or pending action, suit or preceding in advance of final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, unless (i) FleetBoston would be
permitted to advance such expenses pursuant to the RIBCA and FleetBoston's
Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws, and (ii) FleetBoston receives an
undertaking by the Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it is determined
that such party is not entitled to be indemnified by FleetBoston pursuant to the
RIBCA and FleetBoston's Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.7, upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify
FleetBoston thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to so notify shall not
affect the obligations of FleetBoston under this Section 6.7 except to the
extent such failure to notify materially prejudices FleetBoston. FleetBoston's
obligations under this Section 6.7 continue in full force and effect for a
period of six years from the Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. FleetBoston shall pay
all reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided for in this Section 6.7 to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

                  (b)   Nothing contained in Section 6.7(a) or any other
provision of this Agreement shall limit any right to indemnification that any
current or former director, officer, employee or agent of Progress may have
under applicable law or regulation or the certificate of incorporation, charter,
bylaws or equivalent documents of any Progress Subsidiary, in each case as in
effect on the date hereof, which FleetBoston agrees to honor in accordance with
their terms. Without limiting the foregoing, FleetBoston also agrees that the
limitations on liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties in
Progress's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or the equivalent documents of
any Progress Subsidiary as in effect on the date hereof with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and the Bank
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect from and after the Effective
Time.

                  (c)   FleetBoston shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the persons serving as executive officers and directors of Progress
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who are, as of the date of this
Agreement, individually covered by a directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy to be covered for a period of six years after the Effective
Time by the directors' and officers'


                                      -45-
<Page>


liability insurance policy maintained by Progress on the date hereof (provided
that FleetBoston may substitute therefore policies of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than
such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time that were committed by such executive officers and directors in their
capacity as such; PROVIDED HOWEVER, that in no event shall FleetBoston be
required to expend in any one year pursuant to this Section 6.7(b) more than an
amount equal to 200% percent of the current annual amount expended by Progress
to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto (which current amount
is set forth at Section 6.7(b) of the Progress Disclosure Schedule) for such
insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and provided further that if FleetBoston is
unable to maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of the
preceding proviso, FleetBoston shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount. In
connection with the foregoing, Progress agrees to provide such insurer or
substitute insurer with such representations as such insurer may reasonably
request with respect to the reporting of any prior claims.

                  (d)   In the event FleetBoston or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of FleetBoston
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

                  (e)   The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his
or her heirs and representatives.

         6.8      SUBSEQUENT INTERIM AND ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

         As soon as reasonably available, but in no event more than 45 days
after the end of each fiscal quarter (other than the fourth fiscal quarter, as
to which the time period shall be 90 days), Progress will deliver to FleetBoston
its unaudited financial statements as of the end of each such period. As soon as
they are available, Progress will deliver to FleetBoston its audited financial
statements following the end of its fourth quarter and the Thrift Financial
Reports of Progress Bank.

         6.9      ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS.

         In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, or to vest
the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
parties to the Merger or the constituent banks to the Bank Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and FleetBoston's and
Progress's subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by FleetBoston.

<Page>


         6.10     ADVICE OF CHANGES.

         FleetBoston and Progress shall promptly advise the other party of any
change or event that, individually or in the aggregate, has or would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein. From time to time prior to the Effective Time, each
party will promptly supplement or amend its disclosure schedule delivered in
connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter that, if
existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such disclosure schedule or that is
necessary to correct any information in such disclosure schedule that has been
rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such disclosure
schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.3(a) hereof, as the case may
be, or the compliance by Progress or FleetBoston with the covenants set forth in
Section 5.1 and 5.2, respectively.

         6.11     CURRENT INFORMATION.

         During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, Progress will cause one or more of its designated representatives to
confer on a regular and frequent basis (not less than monthly) with
representatives of FleetBoston and to report the general status of the ongoing
operations of Progress. Progress will promptly notify FleetBoston of any
material change in the normal course of business or in the operation of the
properties of Progress and of any governmental complaints, investigations or
hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or
the institution or the threat of litigation involving Progress, and will keep
FleetBoston fully informed of such events.

         6.12     EXECUTION AND AUTHORIZATION OF BANK MERGER AGREEMENT.

         Prior to the Effective Time, FleetBoston shall cause Fleet National
Bank, and Progress shall cause Progress Bank, to execute and deliver the Bank
Merger Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit A.

         6.13     TRANSACTION EXPENSES OF PROGRESS.

                  (a)   Within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, Progress
will amend Section 6.13(a) of the Progress Disclosure Schedule to include an
estimated budget of transaction-related expenses reasonably anticipated to be
payable by Progress in connection with this transaction, including the fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers and other professionals.

                  (b)   Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Progress
shall ask all of its attorneys and other professionals to render current and
correct invoices for all unbilled time and disbursements. Progress shall accrue
and/or pay all of such amounts that are actually due and owing as soon as
possible. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Progress shall accrue
for or pay all fees and expenses incurred during such period in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.


                                      -47-
<Page>


                  (c)   Progress shall advise FleetBoston monthly of all
out-of-pocket expenses that Progress incurs in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         6.14     AFFILIATES.

         Progress shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each director,
executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule
145 under the Securities Act) of Progress to deliver to FleetBoston, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, a written agreement in the form of
Exhibit B hereto.

         6.15     DIVIDENDS.

         Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
parties agree that Progress may declare and pay a regular quarterly dividend on
the Progress Common Stock in an amount not to exceed $0.13 per share for the
third quarter of 2003, which shall be payable on October 31, 2003, and a regular
quarterly dividend in the same amount on the Progress Common Stock for the
fourth quarter of 2003, which shall be payable on the earlier of (i) the Closing
Date (as defined in Section 9.1 hereof) and (ii) January 31, 2004. In the event
that the Closing does not occur prior to April 1, 2004, Progress shall be
entitled to declare and pay a regular quarterly dividend in an amount not to
exceed $0.13 per share for the first fiscal quarter of 2004, which shall be
payable on the earlier of the Closing Date and April 30, 2004. In the event that
the Closing occurs after the record date for the FleetBoston dividend in any
FleetBoston fiscal quarter after the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2003,
then FleetBoston shall pay at the Closing a cash dividend to the holders of
Progress Common Stock equal to the sum of (i) the quotient of the number of days
from the end of FleetBoston's previous fiscal quarter to the Closing Date
divided by 90, multiplied by $0.13, plus (ii) the quotient of the number of days
from the Closing Date to the end of the FleetBoston fiscal quarter in which the
Closing occurs divided by 90, multipled by $0.35, multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio.

         6.16     CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS; RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.

                  (a)   At the request of FleetBoston, each of Progress and the
Progress Subsidiaries shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of
the SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations, modify or change its loan,
other real estate owned, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate
valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of
reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of
FleetBoston, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such modifications or changes need be
made prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1. The
recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement
of previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be
construed as concurrence of Progress or its management with any such
adjustments.

                  (b)   No modification, change or any other action taken by
Progress or any of the Progress Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.16 shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of
this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining

after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
shareholders of Progress:

                                      -53-
<Page>


                  (b)   by either FleetBoston or Progress (provided that the
terminating party is not then in breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein that, individually or in the
aggregate, would give the other party the right to terminate this Agreement) if
there shall have been a breach of any of the representations or warranties set
forth in this Agreement on the part of the other party, if such breach,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the breaching party, and such breach shall not have
been cured within 30 days following receipt by the breaching party of written
notice of such breach from the other party hereto or such breach, by its nature,
cannot be cured prior to the Closing;

                  (c)   by either FleetBoston or Progress (provided that the
terminating party is not then in breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein that, individually or in the
aggregate, would give the other party the right to terminate this Agreement) if
there shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements

shall not have been cured within 30 days following receipt by the breaching
party of written notice of such breach from the other party hereto or such
breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing;

                  (d)   by either FleetBoston or Progress if the Merger shall
not have been consummated on or before June 30, 2004, unless the failure of the
Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements
of such party set forth herein;

                  (e)   by either FleetBoston or Progress upon written notice to
the other party (i) 30 days after the date on which any request or application

recommendation of the Governmental Entity that must grant such Regulatory
Approval, unless within the 30-day period following such denial or withdrawal
the parties agree to file, and have filed with the applicable Governmental
Entity, a petition for rehearing or an amended application, PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that no party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(e), if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall
be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

                  (f)   by either FleetBoston or Progress (PROVIDED that in the
case of Progress that it is not in material breach of its obligations under

reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of
shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

                  (g)   by FleetBoston, if (i) the management of Progress or its
Board of Directors, for any reason, fails to call and hold within 35 days of the
approval for use of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus a special meeting of
Progress's shareholders to consider and approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the Board of Directors of


                                      -54-
<Page>


Progress does not publicly recommend in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that
Progress's stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement, (iii) after
recommending in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that such stockholders approve
and adopt this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Progress shall have
withdrawn, modified or amended such recommendation in any manner adverse to
FleetBoston, or (iv) the Board of Directors of Progress shall have authorized,
recommended, proposed or publicly announced its intention to authorize,
recommend or propose, to engage in any Competing Proposal; or

                  (h)   by Progress, at any time prior to the meeting of the
stockholders of Progress contemplated by Section 6.4 hereof, in order to
concurrently enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior
Competing Proposal which has been received and considered by Progress and the
Board of Directors of Progress in compliance with Section 6.2 hereof, PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that this Agreement may be terminated by Progress pursuant to this
Section 8.1(h) only after the fifth business day following FleetBoston's receipt
of written notice from Progress advising FleetBoston that Progress is prepared
to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Competing
Proposal, and only if, during such five-business day period, FleetBoston does
not, in its sole discretion, make an offer to Progress that the Board of
Directors of Progress determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, is at least as favorable as the Superior Competing
Proposal.

         8.2      EFFECT OF TERMINATION; BREAKUP FEE.

                  (a)   In the event of termination of this Agreement by either
FleetBoston or Progress as provided in Section 8.1 hereof, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect except (i) as set forth in this Section
8.2, the last sentence of Section 6.16(b) and Section 9.3, which shall survive
any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no party shall be relieved or released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful or intentional breach
of any provision of this Agreement. Termination of this Agreement by any party
for any reason shall not have any effect on the Confidentiality Agreements.

                  (b)   In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other
opportunities foregone by FleetBoston while structuring and pursuing the Merger,
the parties hereto agree that Progress shall pay to FleetBoston a termination
fee of $8.0 million in the manner set forth below, and shall reimburse
FleetBoston for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated herein, if:

                           (i)    this Agreement is terminated by FleetBoston
         pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or by Progress under Section 8.1(h); or

                           (ii)   (1) this Agreement is terminated by (A)
         FleetBoston pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or (B) by either FleetBoston or
         Progress pursuant to Section 8.1(f) and in the case of any termination
         pursuant to clause (A) or (B) a Competing Proposal shall have been

         senior management of Progress or the Progress Board of Directors (or
         any person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made known an


                                      -55-

         intention, whether or not conditional, to make a Competing Proposal) at
         any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of
         the vote of the shareholders of Progress contemplated by this Agreement
         at the Special Meeting, in the case of clause (B), or the date of
         termination of this Agreement, in the case of clause (A), and (2)
         within 12 months after such termination of this Agreement, Progress or
         a Subsidiary of Progress enters into any agreement with respect to, or
         consummates, a transaction which is the subject of a Competing
         Proposal.

                  Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section
8.2(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by FleetBoston.

                  (c)   Progress and FleetBoston agree that the agreement
contained in paragraph (b) of this Section 8.2 is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreement
FleetBoston would not have entered into this Agreement and that such amounts do
not constitute a penalty or liquidated damages in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by Progress. If Progress fails to pay FleetBoston the amounts due
under paragraph (b) above within the time periods specified therein, Progress
shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred by FleetBoston in connection with any action in which FleetBoston
prevails, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such
amounts, together with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts at the
prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to
be paid until the date of actual payment.

         8.3      AMENDMENT.

         Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Board of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters
presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Progress;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by Progress's shareholders, there may not be, without further
approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement which by law
requires further approval of the shareholders of Progress without obtaining such
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

         8.4      EXTENSION; WAIVER.

         At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent
legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or


                                      -56-

         The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions

         Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or

any press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise
make any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If either FleetBoston or Progress, or any of
FleetBoston's or Progress's Subsidiaries, is required by law or the rules of the
NYSE or Nasdaq, as applicable, to issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder.

                  (b)   Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, Progress and FleetBoston (and each of their respective employees,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) the date of the execution
of an agreement (with or without conditions) to enter into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither Progress nor
FleetBoston (nor any of their respective employees, representatives or other
agents thereof) may disclose any other information that is not relevant to
understanding the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions

FleetBoston Financial Corporation, the parent corporation of FNB
("FleetBoston"), and Progress Financial Corporation, the parent corporation of
Progress Bank ("Progress") (the "Parent Merger Agreement")), and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Parent Merger Agreement, Progress shall
merge with and into FleetBoston, with FleetBoston continuing as the surviving
entity of such merger (the "Parent Merger").

SECTION 2.

         Immediately following the Effective Time, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Progress Bank shall merge with and into FNB under

(sometimes referred to herein as the "Association") shall be "FLEET NATIONAL
BANK".

SECTION 3.

         The Bank Merger shall become effective upon the date specified in the
certificate to be issued by the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States
of America (the "Comptroller") under the seal of the Comptroller's office

integration and consolidation of internal systems and operations, the business
and operations of the Association, as conducted at its main office and all
branch offices then established and authorized, will be conducted as a single

pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 27,
2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and between FleetBoston and Progress, Progress
shall be merged with and into FleetBoston (the "Merger") and each share of the
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Progress ("Progress Common Stock")
shall be converted into the right to receive the shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of FleetBoston ("FleetBoston Common Stock") determined by
the Exchange Ratio as set forth in the Merger Agreement (subject to the
adjustment described therein). All terms used in this letter but not defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

         I represent, warrant and covenant to FleetBoston that in the event I
receive any FleetBoston Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

a.       I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of FleetBoston
Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

b.       I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and
discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of FleetBoston Common Stock to the extent I
believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for Progress.

c.       I have been advised that the issuance of FleetBoston Common Stock to me
pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that,
since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of
Progress I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of Progress and the
distribution by me of FleetBoston Common Stock has not been registered under the
Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of FleetBoston Common Stock
issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition
has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition
is made in conformity with the volume and other

limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in
the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to FleetBoston, such sale, transfer
or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.

d.       I understand that FleetBoston is under no obligation to register the
sale, transfer or other disposition of FleetBoston Common Stock by me or on my
behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make
compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

e.       I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
FleetBoston's transfer agents with respect to FleetBoston Common Stock and that
there will be placed on the certificates for FleetBoston Common Stock issued to
me, or any substitutions therefore, a legend stating in substance:

         "The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
         transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of
         1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in
         compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a
         registration statement under said act or an exemption from such
         registration."

f.       I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my FleetBoston
Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity
with the provisions of Rule 145, FleetBoston reserves the right to put the
following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:

         "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered
         under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who
         received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated
         under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired
         by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
         distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933
         and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in
         accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the
         Securities Act of 1933."

         It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs
(e) and (f) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates
without such legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to FleetBoston a
copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, an opinion of counsel in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to FleetBoston, or other evidence
reasonably satisfactory to FleetBoston, to the effect that such legend is not
required for purposes of the Act.

         It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate
and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its

terms. It is also understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect upon delivery by the undersigned
to FleetBoston of a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, and opinion of
counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to FleetBoston, or other
evidence reasonably satisfactory to FleetBoston, to the effect that a transfer
of the undersigned's shares of FleetBoston Common Stock will not violate the Act
or any of the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

         Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on my
part that I am an "affiliate" of Progress as described in the first paragraph of
this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that
I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

                                            Very truly yours,
