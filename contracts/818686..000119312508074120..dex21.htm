sole stockholder of Acquisition Sub, has approved this Agreement and the
merger of the Acquisition Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth herein
and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("
_Delaware Law_ "), and in compliance with laws, rules, regulations, orders,
judgments or decrees promulgated by any Governmental Authority of the
countries where the Company and its subsidiaries are located; and

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Company, Buyer and

respective stockholders that the parties consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions provided for herein;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has resolved to recommend to
its stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Company is contemplating distributing to its existing
stockholders prior to the Effective Time all of the shares of common stock of

and

ARTICLE II

_THE MERGER_

Section 2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this

ARTICLE III

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

Section 3.1 _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Acquisition Sub or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub:

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. Each share of
common stock of the Company, par value $0.02 per share, including the
associated Company Rights (as defined herein) (the " _Company Common Stock_
"), owned by the Company or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries or held by
Buyer or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled, retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor
or in respect thereof.

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_.

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section
3.1(a) hereof and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, in cash, without interest. As of the date
hereof, prior to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3.1(c), and without
giving effect to (i) any change in the number of outstanding Company Common
Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Company Options, and (ii) the equitable
adjustment to the exercise prices of the  



 

3  Company Options or the number of outstanding Company Options and Restricted
Stock Units, in each case that will be effected in connection with the Spin-
Off pursuant to Article V of the Employee Matters Agreement (the " _Equity
Adjustment_ "), the Merger Consideration would be equal to $15.02 per share of
Company Common Stock. " _Merger Consideration_ " shall mean the
quotient obtained by dividing (a) the sum of (i) the Aggregate Purchase Price
and (ii) product of (1) the weighted average exercise price for all In-the-
Money Options immediately following the Equity Adjustment (the "
_Equity Adjustment Date_ "), multiplied by (2) the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock into which all In-the-Money Options are convertible as
of the Equity Adjustment Date, by (b) the result of subtracting (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock into which all Out-of-the-Money
Options would be convertible as of the Equity Adjustment Date from (ii) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis
(including all Company Options and Restricted Stock Units) as of the Equity
Adjustment Date. " _Aggregate Purchase Price_ " shall mean $360,000,000 (three
hundred and sixty million dollars), as may be adjusted by application of
Section 3.1(c). 

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to
receive the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i)
shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and the holders of
certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 3.2 of this
Agreement, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon.

(c) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. The Aggregate Purchase Price shall be
adjusted in the following manner:

(i) As soon as practicable prior to the Effective Time, but in any event at
least 14 days prior to the Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall provide
Buyer with a schedule setting forth the determination of the CPEX Value, which
determination shall be final and binding on the Company and Buyer
for purposes of this Agreement.

(ii) The Aggregate Purchase Price shall be reduced by the sum of (A) the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the CPEX Value over (y) the sum of
(1) $65,000,000 and (2) the amount determined under clause (B) below, and (ii)
the applicable Tax rate(s) as would be imposed by Section 11(b)(1) of the
Code assuming no taxable income other than the excess determined under clause
(A)(i) above, and (B) the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the CPEX
Value over (y) $34,000,000 and (ii) 8.5%.

(d) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each share of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, of
Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.



 

4 (e) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, in each case, other than pursuant to the Spin-
Off, the applicable Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(b) shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Company Common Stock_. 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Buyer shall designate a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
reasonably acceptable to the Company for the payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(b)(i). At or prior to the Effective
Time, Buyer shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent for
the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash constituting an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration (such Merger Consideration as
deposited with the Paying Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this
Agreement.

(b) As promptly as practicable following Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (x) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the
form and have such other provisions as Buyer and the Company may reasonably
specify and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the applicable Merger
Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall provide
that at the election of the surrendering holder, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares may be surrendered, and the applicable Merger Consideration in
exchange therefor collected, by hand delivery).

(c) After the Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the applicable Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be
mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the
surrendering holder) as soon as reasonably practicable, after which the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so  



 

5  surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the applicable Merger
Consideration (or the cash pursuant to Section 3.2(d)) payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Buyer
(or its designee), upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who
have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only
to Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws), as
general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for cash, without
interest, to which such holders may be entitled.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Buyer, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such
cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Buyer, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Buyer or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation in (i) direct obligations of the
United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit
of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all
principal and interest, or (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the
highest rating from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, or a combination thereof. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
and be income of Buyer. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Buyer shall
promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to
the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash
payment obligations.

Section 3.3 _Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units_.

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Each Company Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company
Option, become fully vested and be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive at the Effective Time, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the  



 

6  product of (a) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of such Company Option _multiplied by_  (b) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Company Option (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "), less any applicable
withholding taxes. If the applicable exercise price of any Company Option
equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time without payment of consideration, and all
rights with respect to such Company Option shall terminate as of the Effective
Time. As of the Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Option Cash Payment, if any. 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. As of the Effective Time, each
Restricted Stock Unit that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any holder of any Restricted Stock Unit, become fully vested and be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive at the Effective Time, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, a cash
payment with respect thereto equal to the Merger Consideration (the "
_Restricted Stock Unit Payment_ "), less any applicable withholding taxes. As
of the Effective Time, all Restricted Stock Units shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Restricted Stock Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Restricted Stock Unit Payment.

(c) _Necessary Action_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
any and all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
3.3, including, without limitation, providing holders of Company Options and
Restricted Stock Units with notice of their rights with respect to any such
Company Options and Restricted Stock Units as provided herein.

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article III.

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 3.1(b) hereof, to
the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section
262 of Delaware Law, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly
exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section
262 of Delaware Law (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, but, instead, the
holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and
payment under Delaware Law, such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, and such shares shall not be



 

7  deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal filed pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware
Law received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served or delivered in connection with such demands pursuant to
Delaware Law and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands made
pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law. The Company shall not (x) make any
payment with respect to any such demand, (y) offer to settle, settle or
approve any withdrawal or other treatment of, any such demand or (z) waive
any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take
any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware Law,

as applicable, such amounts as Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Options or Restricted Stock Units, as applicable.

Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no covenant is hereby made by

Statement and shall provide Buyer with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and the
staff of the SEC, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to

thereto, the Company shall provide Buyer a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response; _provided_ that Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide or cause to be provided its

the Proxy Statement.

practicable after the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC, the Company
shall mail the Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Common Stock as of

Meeting_"), and the Company shall hold the Stockholders Meeting; provided,
however, that if the Spin-Off has not been completed prior to the date of the

Section 6.4 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings; Spin-Off_.

(a) The parties hereto will use their respective reasonable best efforts to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and to
cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII to be satisfied
including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, consents
and approvals from Governmental Authorities or other persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Authorities if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to avoid
an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other persons
necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions performed or consummated by
such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including seeking

its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions
under the Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

all consents under any antitrust, competition or pharmaceutical Law that
may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local antitrust or

parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, including committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust,  



 

33  or otherwise, as is commercially reasonable, the sale or disposition of such
assets or businesses as are required to be divested (the " _Divestiture_ ")
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any
Order, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall have the sole and
exclusive right, to propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the Divestiture of such assets of
Buyer, the Company, or their respective subsidiaries or otherwise offer to
take or offer to commit (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect)
to take any action as may be required to avoid the entry of, dissolve, vacate
or lift any such Order. Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer will
take any and all commercially reasonable actions necessary in order to ensure
that (x) no requirement for any non-action, a consent or approval of any State
Attorney General or other Governmental Authority, (y) no decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or
proceeding, and (z) no other matter relating to any antitrust or competition
Law which would preclude consummation of the Merger by the Termination Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any of Buyer, Acquisition
Sub, the Company or their respective affiliates be required to take or agree
to take any such action, that, individually or together with any other
such actions, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the financial condition, business, assets or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or an effect of similar
magnitude on Buyer and its subsidiaries.

(c) Each of Buyer and the Company shall give (or shall cause its respective
subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and Buyer and the Company
shall use, and cause each of its subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any third party consents not covered by paragraphs (a) and
(b) above, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger. Each of
the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the
preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and
will cooperate in responding promptly to any inquiry from a Governmental
Authority, including promptly informing the other party of such inquiry,
consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions to a
Governmental Authority (considering in good faith the views of the other
party in any such presentation or submission), supplying each other with
copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between
either party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement.

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete the Spin-Off
as promptly as practicable;  _provided_ that nothing in this Section 6.4(d)
shall require the board of directors of the Company to take any action that
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(e) Each of Buyer and Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, and the Company on the
other hand, covenants and agrees that between the date hereof and
the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1, each of Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall
not, and shall not permit any of their respective subsidiaries to, take or
agree to take any action that would prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Company will provide to Buyer (and its officers,
directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and
other representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable
access during normal business hours to the Companys and its subsidiaries
properties, books, contracts and records, personnel and other information as
Buyer may reasonably request regarding the business, assets, liabilities,
employees and other aspects of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to provide access to any information or
documents which would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) breach
any agreement with any third-party, (ii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-
client or other privilege held by the Company, or (iii) otherwise violate any
applicable Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company has not provided, shall not be required to provide,
and following the Spin-Off the Company shall not have access to, the
properties, books, contracts and records and other information as it relates
to the business, assets, liabilities, employees and other aspects of the Drug
Delivery Business, and neither the Company nor CPEX shall have any obligation
at any time to grant such access to Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall reasonably cooperate to provide requested information and
access with respect to CPEX to the extent reasonably related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall cause the
officers, employees, consultants, agents, accountants, attorneys and other
Representatives of the Company and its subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate
with Buyer and Buyers Representatives in connection with such investigation
and examination, and Buyer and its Representatives shall cooperate with the
Company and its Representatives and shall use their reasonable efforts to
minimize any disruption to the business.

Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.6  _No Solicitation of Competing Proposal_.

agrees that it shall not, nor shall it authorize or knowingly permit any of
its Representatives, or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate
or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of providing material

Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any

subsidiaries, affiliates and their respective Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all existing solicitations, discussions or
negotiations with respect to any person conducted heretofore by the Company,
any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or their respective Representatives
with respect to any Competing Proposal, and shall demand the return or
destruction of any information previously provided with respect to such
activities, discussions or negotiations, subject to the restrictions set

to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall be permitted to terminate,
amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce any provision of any "standstill" or
similar obligation of any person in order that such person may submit a
Competing Proposal if the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial
advisors that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors exercise of their fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 6.6(a), if the
Company receives a bona fide written Competing Proposal that the board
of directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with
the Companys outside legal and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (ii) could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, the Company may, if its board of directors determines in good faith
after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, and subject to compliance with Section 6.6(e),
take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information with respect to
the Company and its subsidiaries to the third party making such Competing
Proposal and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party
with respect to the Competing Proposal, in each case if, and only if, (A) all
such information has previously been provided to Buyer or is provided to Buyer
prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such
third party and (B) prior thereto, the Company and such third party enter into
a confidentiality and standstill with such person that contains
confidentiality and standstill provisions that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) Except as set forth in Section 6.6(d), neither the board of directors of
the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) change, qualify, withhold
or withdraw, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold or withdraw the
Company Recommendation or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly
to recommend, adopt or approve, any Competing Proposal (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") or

Company or any of its affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to,
any Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
referred to in Section 6.6(b)) (each of the documents referred to in this
clause (ii) shall be an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.6(c), if at any time prior to
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of the
Company has  



 

36  concluded in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal
and financial advisors and after complying with and giving effect to
all proposed adjustments to this Agreement offered by Buyer pursuant to this
Section 6.6(d)) (i)(x) in response to a bona fide written Competing Proposal
that was unsolicited, that such proposal is a Superior Proposal, and (y) that
the failure of the board of directors of the Company to change, qualify,
withhold or withdraw the Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
directors exercise of their fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law, or (ii) in the absence of a Competing Proposal, the
failure of the board of directors of the Company to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law, the board of directors of the
Company may, subject to complying with Section 8.2(a), (1) change, qualify,
withhold or withdraw the Company Recommendation and/or (2) in the case of
clause (i) of this sentence, terminate this Agreement to enter into a binding
written agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance with
Section 8.1(g); _provided_ , that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (2) and any purported termination
pursuant to the foregoing clause (2) shall be void and of no force or effect
unless, in advance of or concurrently with such termination, the Company (X)
pays the Company Termination Fee, as required by Section 8.2, and (Y)
simultaneously with such termination enters into an Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Competing Proposal and terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(g); _provided_ , _further_ that prior to taking any of the
actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence, the Company shall
have given Buyer at least three (3) business days written notice (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to the amount or form of
consideration of the Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new
three (3) business day period) of the material terms of the Superior Proposal
and the Companys intention to accept such Superior Proposal, and the Company
shall, during such three (3) business day period, negotiate in good faith with
Buyer to make such adjustments to the Merger Consideration and other terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that such Competing Proposal would no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal. The board of directors of the Company
shall promptly consider in good faith (in consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) any proposed alteration of the terms of this
Agreement or the Merger proposed by Buyer in response to any Competing
Proposal.

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section
6.6(a), (b) and (c), the Company shall promptly (but in any event within 24
hours of receipt) notify Buyer of any (i) Competing Proposal, (ii) the
material terms and conditions of any such Competing Proposal (including any
material changes thereto), and (iii) the identity of the person making any
such Competing Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide to Buyer any non-
public information concerning the Company provided to any other person in
connection with any Competing Proposal that was not previously provided to
Buyer and any such non-public information shall be held by Buyer subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.6 shall prohibit the Company or the
board of directors of the Company from (i) disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if
the board of directors of the Company has reasonably determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure
to do so would be inconsistent with any applicable Law. The disclosures under
this Section 6.6(f) shall  



 

37  not be a basis, in themselves, for Buyer to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(f) so long as any such disclosure rejects any
Competing Proposal and reaffirms the Company Recommendation.

(g) As used in this Agreement, _"Competing Proposal_ " shall mean
any proposal or offer from any third party (other than a proposal or offer by
Buyer or any of its subsidiaries) relating to, or any inquiry that would
reasonably be expected to lead to (i) a merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share
exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or
any of its significant subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or the
stockholders of any person would own twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its significant
subsidiaries or of any resulting parent company of the Company; or (ii) any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase by any person, in one transaction
or a series of transactions, that would constitute twenty-five percent (25%)
or more of the revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole (but exclusive of CPEX), or twenty-five
percent (25%) or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any
of its significant subsidiaries.

(h) As used in this Agreement,  _"Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a Competing
Proposal for or in respect of, or that if consummated would be reasonably
likely to result in the ownership of, at least a majority of, the outstanding
Company Common Stock (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or
indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially
all of the Companys and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (but exclusive of
CPEX), assets, made by any person on terms that the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as the board of
directors of the Company in good faith considers to be appropriate (including
the conditionality and the timing, the likelihood of consummation of such
proposal and the financing thereof), to be more favorable to the Company and
its stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Merger. Reference to "this Agreement" and "the Merger" in this Section 6.6(h)
shall be deemed to include any proposed alteration of the terms of this
Agreement or the Merger that is agreed to by Buyer after it receives written
notice from the Company pursuant to Section 6.6(e) of the existence of, the
identity of the person making and the material terms and conditions of, any
Competing Proposal.

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Buyer and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company
or its subsidiaries (other than CPEX) as provided in their respective articles
of association, certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organization documents) or agreements shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Buyer
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
and advance expenses to Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions by
them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent required by: (i) the Company  



 

38  Certificate or Company By-Laws and the organizational documents of the
Companys subsidiaries (other than CPEX), each as in effect on the date of
this Agreement; and (ii) any indemnification agreements of the Company or its
subsidiaries (other than CPEX) as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
copies of which have been made available to Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Section 6.7(a) shall affect the rights of any employee of
CPEX existing pursuant to (i) the Company Certificate or Company By-Laws and
the organizational documents of the Companys subsidiaries (other than CPEX),
each as in effect on the date of this Agreement; and (ii) any indemnification
agreements of the Company or its subsidiaries (other than CPEX) as in effect
on the date of this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.7(a), during the period
beginning as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Buyer will: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee
against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A)
any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitees
capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates; or (B) the Merger, the Merger Agreement and any
transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay in advance of the
final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation the expenses (including attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without the
Surviving Corporations prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and will not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnitees in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation; _provided_ that in the event any Indemnitees interests
conflict with those of another Indemnitee with respect to any single such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, the Surviving Corporation
will be obligated to pay fees and expenses of one separate counsel for each
such Indemnitee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 6.7(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation shall
not (and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this Section
6.7(b) unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(c) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, (i) Buyer shall maintain, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, in effect the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance, as disclosed or made
available to Buyer prior to the date hereof (or such other insurance that is
no less favorable to the Indemnitees than the Companys current directors
and officers liability insurance), in respect of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Indemnitee currently covered
by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy, on
terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those
of such policy in effect on the date hereof; or (ii) Buyer or the Surviving  



 

39  Corporation may substitute therefor a single premium tail policy with
respect to such directors and officers liability insurance, as disclosed
to Buyer prior to the date hereof, from an insurance carrier with the same or
better AM Best rating as the Companys current insurance carrier for such
insurance policy, with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective
Time, and policy limits, terms and conditions (including deductibles and
exclusions) at least as favorable to the directors and officers covered under
such insurance policy as the limits, terms and conditions in the existing
policies of the Company;  _provided_ , that in connection with this Section
6.7(c), neither the Surviving Corporation nor Buyer shall be obligated to pay
annual premiums (in connection with any directors and officers liability
insurance policy described in clause (c)(i) above) in excess of the annual
premiums set forth in Section 6.7(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or
pay a one-time premium (in connection with a single premium tail policy
described in clause (c)(ii) above) in excess of the amount set forth in
Section 6.7(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. It is understood and
agreed that in the event such coverage cannot be obtained for such amount or
less, then the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of
coverage as may be obtained for such amount.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 9.1 or Section 9.6 hereof
to the contrary, this Section 6.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, and shall be
enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

Section 6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any
notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or from any person alleging that the consent
of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Buyer and (ii) any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by such party that would reasonably
be expected to cause the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.3(a),
respectively, not to be satisfied. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Buyer of, and cooperate with Buyer in connection with, (i) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced, pending, relating to,
involving or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened against or otherwise
affecting the Company, any of its subsidiaries or their respective officers,
directors or employees, which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) any stockholder litigation or claims
against the Company, any of its subsidiaries or their respective officers,
directors or employees relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby. No settlement in connection with any claim,
suit, hearing, proceeding or litigation referred to in clause (i) or (ii)
above shall be agreed to without Buyers prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



 

40 Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. Buyer and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement without the prior consent of the other (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Law or any
stock exchange listing agreement to which Buyer or the Company is a party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be permitted to make such
announcements and disclosures as it reasonably deems necessary or advisable to
the extent such statements relate solely to the Spin-Off or the Drug Delivery
Business. The parties agree that all formal Company employee communication
programs or announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger, shall be in the forms mutually agreed to
by the parties (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in
the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

(a) As of the Effective Time, all rights and obligations arising from any
employment contract or employment relationship existing in the Company or in
any of its subsidiaries, shall be transferred to the Surviving Corporation.

(b) During the twelve (12) month period commencing on the Effective Time,
Buyer shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to
(after giving effect to the Spin-Off) each current employee, officer, director
or consultant of the Company and any of its subsidiaries at Closing (each, a "
_Company Employee_ " and collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") (i)
compensation no less favorable than the compensation being provided to Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (including equity-based
compensation, as valued by Buyer in good faith), and (ii) benefits under
employee benefit plans that are the same or substantially comparable in the
aggregate to, in the sole discretion of Buyer, either (A) those currently
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees under the
Company Benefit Plans as of the Closing Date (excluding equity-based plans) or
(B) those provided by Buyer and its Subsidiaries to comparably situated
employees from time to time during such twelve (12) month period.

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, determination of the level of
benefits and benefit accrual under the Employee Benefit Plans of Buyer, the
Company, the Companys subsidiaries and their respective affiliates providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), and
for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance
benefits under New Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company, the Company subsidiaries and their
respective affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor
employer) before the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was
entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar
Company Benefit Plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee  



 

41  participated immediately before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Buyer shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and Buyer shall
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents under any Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year
of the New Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Effective
Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with
their terms all employment, change in control, severance and other
compensation agreements and arrangements existing prior to the execution of
this Agreement which are between the Company and any subsidiary and any
Company Employee and set forth in Section 6.10(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (each, a " _Company Executive Agreement_ "); subject, in each case,
to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by the terms of
such agreements or arrangements; _provided_ , that no such amendment or
termination shall be effected by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation if it
would adversely affect an employees (or former employees) rights resulting
from the or relating to the Merger, this Agreement or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company and Buyer hereby agree that the occurrence of
the Closing shall constitute a " _Change in Control_ " for purposes of any
Company Executive Agreement set forth in Section 6.10(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(e) Following the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries to honor any Company collective bargaining agreements,
and to preserve the status and functions of any union representative of the
current Company Employees, or any current Company Employee serving as a
liaison between the Company Employees and applicable unions, on the same terms
and subject to the same conditions as existed prior to the Effective Time.

(f) If requested by Buyer at least five (5) business days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably
necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the Effective
Time, any Company Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company
401(k) Plan_ "). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k)
Plan, then the Company shall provide to Buyer prior to the Closing Date
written evidence of the adoption by the Board of Directors of the Company of
resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form
and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

(g) This Section 6.10 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.10,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under  



 

42  or by reason of this Section 6.10. Without limiting the foregoing, no
provision of this Section 6.10 will create any third party beneficiary
rights in any current or former employee, director or consultant of the
Company or its subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed
employment) or any other matter. Nothing in this Section 6.10 is intended to
amend any Company Benefit Plan, or interfere with Buyers or the Surviving
Corporations right from and after the Effective Time to amend or terminate
any Company Benefit Plan or the employment or provision of services by any
director, employee, independent contractor or consultant.

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.10 shall not apply to any
current or former employees, officers, directors or consultants of CPEX.

contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order or other action shall have
become final and non-appealable, _provided_ that the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to remove such Order or other action; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(c) shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such final, non-
appealable Order was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any
of its obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
obligation of Buyer and Acquisition Sub to take any and all commercially
reasonable steps in accordance with Section 6.4(b) of this Agreement so as to
allow the parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as

such termination;

(f) by Buyer, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of

expenses, incurred or suffered by the other party or parties as a result
of such failure or breach, (b) with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement
(which shall terminate in accordance with its terms), and (c) the provisions
of Section 8.2 (including with respect to any Company Termination Fee that may
be payable pursuant thereto), Section 8.5 and Article IX.

Section 8.2 _Termination Fees_.

(a) If,

(i) (x) prior to the termination of this Agreement, any Competing Proposal is
made to the Company or is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to,
obtaining the Requisite Stockholders Approval, (y) this Agreement is
terminated by the Company or Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(b) (but only if at

application of Section 8.1(b)(ii)) or (d) and (z) within twelve (12) months
after such termination, (1) the Company enters into any definitive agreement
providing for the consummation of a Competing Proposal (whether or not such
agreement shall have been entered into with the person who made the Competing
Proposal referred to in the foregoing clause (x)) or (2) the transactions
contemplated by any such Competing Proposal (whether or not such Competing
Proposal was the Competing Proposal referred to in the foregoing clause (x))
are otherwise consummated;

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g);

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(h); or

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Buyer pursuant to Section

prohibited from terminating this Agreement by application of Section
8.1(b)(ii)) and at the time of such termination, (i) the Company has failed to
effect the Spin-Off and (ii) (x) the SEC has previously indicated that it has
no additional comments to the Registration Statement on Form 10 last filed by

Company has sufficient surplus under Delaware Law to make the distribution of
CPEX common stock and that each of the Company and CPEX will be solvent and
adequately capitalized after giving effect to the distribution;



 

46 then in any such event the Company shall pay to Buyer a fee of U.S.$13,000,000
(thirteen million dollars) in cash (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") and
the Company shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby to Buyer (provided that nothing herein
shall release any party from liability for intentional breach or fraud), such
payment to be made in the case of (x) termination pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i), no later than the date of the first to occur of the events referred
to in Section 8.2(a)(i)(z), (y) termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(ii),

Company be required to pay the fee referred to in this Section 8.2(a) on more
than one occasion. Any such payment shall be reduced by any amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Law.

Section 8.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards
of directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, after the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger by

in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires further approval
by the stockholders of the Company without such further approval of such
stockholders nor any amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law.

the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity, without
any requirement to the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy.

Section 9.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the

is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Buyer and Acquisition Sub, (c) the
provisions of Section 6.7 hereof, and (d) the right of the holders of Company
Options and Restricted Stock Units to receive payment at the applicable time,
pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof, is not intended to and shall not confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, except that
the Merger shall be governed by Delaware Law.

against you in any such court. The parties agree that a final judgment in any
such dispute shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suits on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(b) Each of Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Company irrevocably consents to the
service of the summons and complaint and any other process in any
other action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, on behalf of itself or its property, by personal delivery of copies
of such process to such party. Nothing in this Section 9.9 shall affect the
right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

Section 9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in two (2) or more counterparts, and by
the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
