 SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July 26,
2019, is made by and among (a) Parker-Hannifin Corporation, an Ohio
corporation (" _Buyer_ "), (b) EMFCO Holdings Incorporated, a Washington
corporation (the " _Company_ "), (c) the undersigned shareholders of the
Company (each, a " _Seller_ " and, together, the " _Sellers_ ") and (d)
Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as the " _Seller
Representative_ ". Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined
herein have the meanings set forth in _Exhibit_ __ _ A_.

WHEREAS, Sellers own all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Company (collectively, the " _Shares_ ");

WHEREAS, prior to the Closing, the Sellers and the Company shall effectuate
the transactions set forth in _Sections 7.07(j)(i)  (iv)_, pursuant to which
NewCo Seller (as defined below) shall become the sole owner of the Shares, and
the Company shall be converted from a corporation to a Delaware limited
liability company pursuant to applicable Law;

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer desires to purchase from NewCo Seller, and Sellers desire to
cause NewCo Seller to sell to Buyer, all of the Shares;

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of managers or directors or other governing
bodies, as applicable, of the Company and Buyer have approved this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Buyers willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain Sellers are entering into restrictive covenant agreements
by and between each such Seller and Buyer, which shall become effective as of
the Closing (collectively, the " _Restrictive Covenant Agreements_ "); and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
certain employees of the Company have entered into the Retention Agreements.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I.

PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

1.01 _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. On and subject to the terms
and conditions contained herein, at the Closing, Sellers will sell, assign,
transfer and convey to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase and acquire from
Sellers, all of the Shares in exchange for the payment of the Purchase Price
as set forth in this  _ARTICLE_ __ _ I_. 1.02 _Calculation of Estimated Purchase Price_. At least two Business
Days prior to the Closing, the Company will prepare and deliver to Buyer (a)
an estimated unaudited balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the Adjustment Time (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (b) a
statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth a good faith
calculation of (i) the estimated Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the estimated Closing Cash (the "
_Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (iii) the estimated Closing Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), (iv) the estimated Transaction Expenses
(the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), and (v) the Companys calculation
of the Estimated Purchase Price derived from the foregoing and (c) the Closing
Payment that NewCo Seller is entitled to receive and payment instructions for
receipt of the Closing Payment and any other amounts required to be paid to
NewCo Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the " _Seller Payment
Instructions_ "). The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated
Closing Statement will be prepared, and the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital, the Estimated Closing Cash, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and
the Estimated Transaction Expenses will be determined, in each case, in good
faith and on a consolidated basis in accordance with the definitions set
forth in this Agreement and in the case of the calculation of Net Working
Capital, as set forth on the sample calculation set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _
B_ (the " _Sample Statement_ "), and, to the extent not inconsistent with the
definitions set forth in this Agreement and the Sample Statement, GAAP applied
on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet.

 

1.03 _Closing Payments_.

 

 (a) At the Closing, Buyer will deliver, or cause to be delivered, an
amount in cash equal to: (i) the Estimated Purchase Price _minus_ (ii) the
Adjustment Escrow Deposit Amount, _minus_ (iii) the Maximum Retention Bonus
Amount, _minus_ (iv) the Representative Expense Fund (the " _Closing Payment_
") to NewCo Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with the Seller Payment Instructions.

 

 (b) At the Closing, Buyer will deliver, or cause to be delivered, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (i) the Adjustment Escrow Deposit
Amount, to an escrow account designated by the Escrow Agent no later than two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ ")
and established pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement to be dated as
of the Closing Date and in the form attached as _Exhibit_ __ _ C_ (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "), among Buyer, Seller Representative and the
Escrow Agent and (ii) the Maximum Retention Bonus Amount, to an escrow
account designated by the Escrow Agent no later than two Business Days prior
to the Closing Date (the " _Retention Bonus Escrow Account_ ") and established
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Adjustment Escrow Account
will be maintained separately from other funds held by the Escrow Agent and
will be Buyers sole and exclusive source of recovery for any amounts owing to
Buyer under  _Section_ __ _ 1.04_.

 (c) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, all Estimated Transaction Expenses
(excluding the Retention Bonuses) in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the accounts designated by the Company at least two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 (d) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or cause to be paid, to the Seller
Representative, on behalf of Sellers, the Representative Expense Fund in cash
by wire transfer of

 



-2-  immediately available funds to the accounts designated by the Company at
least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

 (e) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or cause to be paid, the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness set forth on _Schedule 1.03(e)_ in cash by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the accounts designated in any payoff or
other customary documentation evidencing the repayment or redemption of the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness delivered in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.08_.

 

1.04 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_. Following the Closing
Date, the Estimated Purchase Price will be adjusted, if at all, dollar-for-
dollar as set forth below:

 

 (a) Buyer will prepare and deliver to Seller Representative within 75
days after the Closing Date (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Adjustment Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ")
and (ii) a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
a calculation of (A) the Closing Net Working Capital, (B) the Closing Cash,
(C) the Closing Indebtedness, (D) the Transaction Expenses, (E) Buyers
calculation of the Final Purchase Price derived from the foregoing, and (F)
with respect to each of the foregoing, the changes in such amounts from the
corresponding amounts on the Estimated Closing Statement. The Closing Balance
Sheet and Closing Statement will be prepared, and the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses will be
determined, in each case, in good faith and on a consolidated basis in
accordance with the definitions set forth in this Agreement, in the case of
the calculation of Net Working Capital, as set forth on the Sample Statement,
and, to the extent not inconsistent with the definitions set forth in this
Agreement and the Sample Statement, GAAP applied on a basis consistent with
the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet. The Closing Balance Sheet and
Closing Statement (1) will not include any changes in assets or liabilities as
a result of purchase or other accounting adjustments or other changes arising
from or resulting as a consequence of the Transactions, and (2) will be based
on facts and circumstances as they exist as of the Adjustment Time and will
exclude the effect of any act, decision or event occurring on or after the
Closing. The parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing Statement and calculating Final Purchase Price is solely
to (x) accurately measure the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and (y) measure the difference
in Closing Net Working Capital from Target Net Working Capital Range, and such
processes are not intended to permit the introduction of different judgments,
accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
reserves classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of
calculating Final Purchase Price than were used in the calculation of
Estimated Purchase Price.

 

 (b) On or prior to the 60th day following Buyers delivery of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, Seller Representative may give Buyer
a written notice stating in reasonable detail Sellers objections (a " _Notice
of Disagreement_ ") to the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement.
During such 60-day period, and any period of dispute thereafter with respect
to such Closing Balance Sheet and/or Closing Statement, subject to the
limitations set forth in the last sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, Buyer
will, and will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide Seller
Representative and its Advisors reasonable access to the books, records,
systems, supporting data, facilities, and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including Company personnel responsible for accounting and
finance and senior management)

 



-3-  and, subject to execution of any customary work paper access letters
required by them, the Companys accountants and their work papers, and (ii)
otherwise reasonably cooperate with and assist Seller Representative and its
Advisors in connection with such review. Any determination set forth on the
Closing Statement which is not specifically objected to in the Notice of
Disagreement will be deemed to have been accepted by Sellers, and will be
final and binding upon all parties upon delivery of the Notice of
Disagreement. If Seller Representative does not deliver to Buyer a Notice of
Disagreement within such 60-day period, then the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Closing Statement and the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, and Transaction Expenses, each as delivered by Buyer, will be
final and binding upon the parties as of the expiration of such 60-day period,
and the Final Purchase Price set forth in the Closing Statement delivered by
Buyer will constitute the Final Purchase Price for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 

 (c) Following Buyers receipt of any Notice of Disagreement, Seller
Representative and Buyer will attempt to negotiate in good faith to resolve
the disputed matters set forth therein, and all such discussions and
negotiations related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and
Seller Representative) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and any applicable
similar state rule. If Seller Representative and Buyer fail to agree on any of
Seller Representatives proposed adjustments set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement within 30 days after Seller Representative delivers the Notice of
Disagreement, Seller Representative and Buyer shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause Grant Thornton LLP ( _provided_ that if
Grant Thornton LLP is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, Seller
Representative and Buyer shall jointly select an alternative firm that is a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm) (the " _Neutral Auditor_
"), within 45 days immediately following such first 30-day period, to make
the final written determination of all matters which remain in dispute that
were included in the Notice of Disagreement. Buyer and Seller Representative
will instruct the Neutral Auditor to, and the Neutral Auditor will, make a
final determination of the items included in the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement (to the extent such amounts are in dispute) solely
in accordance with this Agreement. Buyer and Seller Representative will
execute a customary engagement letter and will cooperate with the Neutral
Auditor during the term of its engagement. Buyer and Seller Representative
will instruct the Neutral Auditor not to, and the Neutral Auditor will not,
assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such
item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller Representative, on the
other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer,
on the one hand, or Seller Representative, on the other hand. Buyer and Seller
Representative will also instruct the Neutral Auditor to, and the Neutral
Auditor will, make its determination based solely on written submissions by
Buyer and Seller Representative that are in accordance with this Agreement and
not on the basis of an independent review. The Closing Balance Sheet, the
Closing Statement and the resulting Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, in each case, as
determined by the Neutral Auditor in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
1.04_, will be final and binding on the parties hereto on the date the Neutral
Auditor delivers its final determination in writing to Buyer and Seller
Representative. The date on which the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing
Statement and the resulting Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses are finally determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.04(b)_, are agreed upon by Buyer and Seller Representative
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.04(c)_ or are determined by the Neutral
Auditor in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.04(c)_ is referred to as
the " _Settlement Date_ ". The fees, costs and

 



-4-  expenses of the Neutral Auditor will be allocated between Buyer, on the one
hand, and Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), on the other hand,
in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items so
submitted to the Neutral Auditor that is unsuccessfully disputed by such party
(as finally determined by the Neutral Auditor) bears to the total amount of
disputed items submitted. For example, if Seller Representative submits a
Notice of Disagreement for $1,000, and if Buyer contests only $500 of the
amount claimed by Seller Representative, and if the Neutral Auditor ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding Seller Representative $300 of the
$500 contested Neutral Auditor then the costs and expenses of the Neutral
Auditor will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200/500)
to Seller Representative. The Neutral Auditor shall only have the authority to
resolve disputes between Buyer and the Seller Representative (on behalf of
the Sellers) regarding the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement and the resulting calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses,
pursuant to the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 1.04(c)_.

 

 (d) If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price
(such excess, the " _Excess Amount_ "), Buyer and Seller Representative will
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow
Agent to pay to Buyer (or its designee), within five Business Days after the
Settlement Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Excess
Amount from the Adjustment Escrow Funds. In the event that at such time the
Excess Amount is less than the Adjustment Escrow Funds (such shortfall, the "
_Remaining Adjustment Escrow Funds_ "), Buyer and Seller Representative will
simultaneously with delivery of the instructions in the immediately foregoing
sentence deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the
Escrow Agent to pay the Remaining Adjustment Escrow Funds from the Adjustment
Escrow Account to NewCo Seller. In the event that the Excess Amount exceeds
the Adjustment Escrow Funds, the payment to Buyer pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 1.04(d)_ shall equal the Adjustment Escrow Funds.

 (e) If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price
(such excess, the " _Adjustment Amount_ "), then (i) Buyer will, within five
Business Days after the Settlement Date, make payment of the Adjustment Amount
to NewCo Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance
with the Seller Payment Instructions, and (ii) Buyer and Seller Representative
will deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the
Escrow Agent to make payment of the Adjustment Escrow Funds from
the Adjustment Escrow Account, within five Business Days after the Settlement
Date, to NewCo Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with the Seller Payment Instructions.

 

 (f) The parties hereto agree that any payment made pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.04_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the aggregate
consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

1.05 _Retention Bonus Payments_. The employees set forth on  _Schedule_
__ _ 1.05_ (the " _Retention Employees_ ") shall have the opportunity to
earn, in accordance with the Retention Agreements, up to an aggregate amount
equal to the Maximum Retention Bonus Amount. Within two Business Days of
November 30, 2020, the Escrow Agent shall pay from the Retention Bonus Escrow
Account (a) to Buyer, the Maximum Retention Bonus Amount less any Retention
Bonuses that have been forfeited by any Retention Employee in accordance with
such Retention

 



-5-  Employees Retention Agreement (such aggregate forfeited amount, the "
_Forfeited Retention Bonus Amount_ ") and (b) to NewCo Seller, the Forfeited
Retention Bonus Amount. Buyer shall promptly (and in no event later than two
Business Days after receipt of the funds from the Retention Bonus Escrow
Account) pay to each Retention Employee the applicable Retention Bonus in
accordance with such Retention Employees Retention Agreement.

1.06 _Withholding Rights_. Buyer, Sellers and the Company will
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement only such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely
remitted in full to the applicable Tax Authority by Buyer, Sellers or the
Company, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. Except with respect to any recipient of a
compensatory payment who is an employee or former employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, if Buyer, a Seller or the Company determines that
withholding from any payment that is not compensatory contemplated hereunder
is required under applicable Tax Law and permitted under this Agreement,
Buyer, such Seller or the Company, as applicable, will use commercially
reasonable efforts to so notify the applicable recipient at least five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date or any subsequent date that the
applicable payment is to be made, or as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, so as to provide such recipient with an opportunity to provide
any form or documentation or take such other steps in order to avoid such
withholding. For the avoidance of doubt, in the absence of such form or
documentation, Buyer, such Seller or the Company, as applicable, will be
entitled to withhold amounts in accordance with the first sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 1.06_. If Buyer, a Seller or the Company withholds any amount
which it was not required to withhold, it will promptly, but in any event
within five Business Days after demand therefor (including wire transfer
information as applicable), remit to the appropriate recipient thereof such
amount wrongly withheld.

in each of the following: (i) as promptly as reasonably
practicable, furnishing Buyer, its Affiliates and any financing sources with
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its

statements; (ii) reasonably assisting with the preparation of lender and
investor presentations, rating agency presentations, and similar documents and
materials, in connection with any financing; (iii) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings and presentations with prospective lenders,
and sessions with ratings agencies, in each case upon reasonable notice and

to any such financing and (vii) cooperate with any financing sources due
diligence, to the extent customary or reasonable); provided, however, that (x)

any of the Company Representatives to pay any fees or expenses or otherwise
incur any Liability or give any indemnities prior to the Closing Date, (y) any

become effective until the consummation of the Closing and (z) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to pass resolutions or
consents or approve or authorize the execution of any financing arrangements
prior to the Closing, except to the extent the effectiveness of such
authorization or the effectiveness of such arrangement is conditioned upon the
Closing. Such assistance will not require the Company or any of its Affiliates
to agree to any contractual obligation relating to such financing that is
not conditioned upon the Closing and that does not terminate without
Liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates upon the termination of this
Agreement.

 

 (b) In each case of this _Section_ __ _ 6.07_, the
Companys cooperation will be at Buyers written request with reasonable
prior notice and at Buyers sole cost and expense. The Company and its

goodwill of the Company and its Subsidiaries. All information provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries, the Seller Representative or any of their
respective Affiliates or any of their respective representatives under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.07_ will be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. Buyer agrees and acknowledges that the Company and
its Subsidiaries will not be considered to have breached this _Section_ __ _
6.07_ unless the Company or its Subsidiaries has willfully and materially
breached this  _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ and such breach has caused any such
financing to not to be obtained. No Affiliate of the Company will have any
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ following the consummation of
the Closing. Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Sellers and their respective directors, managers, officers,
equityholders, employees and agents from and against any liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of such
financing or any assistance or activities as provided by this _Section_ __ _
6.07_.

 

6.08 _Payoff Letters_. At least three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Sellers or the Company will deliver to Buyer (a) copies of executed
payoff letters for, or other customary documentation evidencing the repayment
or redemption of, the Indebtedness, if any, listed on _Schedule 6.08(a)_ or
any Indebtedness for borrowed money incurred in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 6.01_, and (b) any releases necessary to release all liens securing such
Indebtedness, in each case in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Buyer.

_Section_ __ _ 5.04_ or that relate to the consummation of the
Transactions; and (d) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement at any time during the term
hereof that would reasonably be expected to cause the condition set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ not to be satisfied; _provided_ that, the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_ will not limit any of the
representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in this Agreement or the
remedies available hereunder to the Company or any Seller.

 

7.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
(including the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_), Buyer

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have
under any other agreement, from the Closing Date through the sixth anniversary

and hold harmless each present (as of immediately prior to the Closing) and
former officer, director, manager, managing member, member or partner
(general or limited) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "
_Indemnified Person_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Indemnified Person is or was an officer, director, manager, managing
member or partner (general or limited) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing (including with respect to acts or
omissions of each Indemnified Person occurring prior to Closing, including in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law. If any such action, suit, claim, investigation or
proceeding occurs, (i) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to advancement
of expenses incurred in the defense of any action, suit, claim, investigation
or proceeding from Buyer or the Company and its Subsidiaries within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt by Buyer or the Company from the Indemnified Person
of a request therefor; _provided_ that, any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the
WBCA or other applicable Law and by the articles of incorporation, bylaws,
limited liability company agreement or operating agreement (or equivalent
organizational documents) of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is
not entitled to indemnification, (ii) neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
proceeding or threatened action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding in
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Person hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such
action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding (including all attorneys
fees and expenses) or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents and (iii)
Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates will reasonably cooperate
in the defense of any such matter.

 

 (b) For a period of at least six years from the Closing Date, Buyer and
the Company will not, and will not permit any of their Subsidiaries to,
amend, repeal or modify any provision in such Persons articles of
incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement or operating
agreement (or equivalent organizational documents), or in any agreement,
relating to the exculpation or indemnification of, or advancement of expenses
to, any Indemnified Person as in effect immediately prior to the Closing in
any manner adverse to any Indemnified Person, and Buyer and the Company will
cause all such provisions to be observed by their Subsidiaries, it being the
intent of the parties that any Indemnified Person will continue to be entitled
to such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.

 (c) Prior to the Closing, the Company will (at Buyers expense) obtain,
maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies or similar
protection to the extent available naming the Indemnified Persons as direct
beneficiaries on terms mutually acceptable to

 



-41-  the Parties; _provided_ that, if any claim is brought under any such policy
before the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, such insurance policies will
be maintained until final disposition thereof. Buyer and the Company will
not, and will cause their Subsidiaries to not, cancel or change such insurance
policies in any respect.

 

 (d) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of expenses
as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which any Indemnified Person may at any time be entitled. No right
or remedy herein conferred by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of
any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or
now or hereafter existing at Law or in equity or otherwise.

respective successors or assigns of the foregoing (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the surviving or continuing entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties, rights or assets to any Person, then, in each case, the
successors and assigns of such Persons or properties, rights or assets, as the
case may be, must expressly assume in writing and be bound by the obligations
set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ as a condition of succession of
assignment.

 

 (f) This _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ is intended to be for the benefit of
each of the Indemnified Persons and may be enforced by any such Indemnified
Person as if such Indemnified Person were a party to this Agreement. The
obligations of Buyer and the Company under this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ will not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person.

 

 (g) Buyer and the Company, on behalf of themselves and their
Subsidiaries, knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and
agree, that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ and the
indemnification contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ require performance
after the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law and will
survive the Closing for the maximum duration permitted under applicable Law
(or if earlier, when no obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ remain)
and will not be subject to any of the survival or exclusive remedy provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 11.01_.

 

7.06 _Contact with Business Relations_. Without limiting the provisions
of  _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, Buyer acknowledges that it is not authorized to,
and agrees that it will not, and it will not permit any member of the Buyer

vendor, distributor, referral source, lessee, lessor, equityholder, lender,
noteholder or other material business relation of the Company or its
Subsidiaries before the Closing with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries,

prior written consent of the Company, except for contacts made in the ordinary
course of Buyers business unrelated to the Transactions.

 

7.07 _Tax Matters_.

 

 (a) _Transfer Taxes_. At the Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly
when due thereafter, all sales, use, conveyance, registration, business and
securities transactions, real estate,

 



-42-  land transfer, stamp, documentary, notarial, filing, recording, permit,
license, authorization or similar Taxes and all applicable conveyance fees,
recording charges and other similar fees and charges (excluding all income,
gains or receipts Taxes) applicable to, arising out of or imposed upon the
Transactions, whether imposed on Buyer, Sellers, the Company or the Companys
Subsidiaries resulting from the Transactions (collectively, " _Transfer
Taxes_ ") will be paid by Buyer and Buyer will indemnify and hold Seller
harmless against all such Transfer Taxes. Buyer will prepare any Tax Returns
with respect to such Taxes, and Seller Representative will cooperate
with Buyer in the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller Representative shall have
no obligations to prepare or file any Tax Returns.

 

 (b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, the Company and Sellers will,
and Sellers will cause the NewCo Seller to, cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by any other party hereto, in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns, any Tax audits, Tax proceedings or
other Tax-related claims. Such cooperation will include providing records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such matters, making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis during normal business hours to
provide additional information and explaining any materials provided pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 7.07(b)_.

 

 (c) _Certain Tax Returns_. Following the Closing, NewCo Seller shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, all income Tax Returns of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for reporting flow-through Tax items of the Sellers or the
NewCo Seller that are due after the Closing Date with respect to any taxable
period that ends on or before the Closing Date (such Tax Returns, " _Pre-
Closing Tax Returns_"). Any such Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries
except as otherwise required by applicable Law, provided that any Transaction
Tax Deductions that accrue on or prior to the Closing Date shall be allocated
to the taxable year or portion thereof ending on the Closing Date to the
maximum extent permissible under applicable Law. Other than with respect to
the Companys federal income Tax Return for calendar year 2018, at least 30
days prior to the due date for filing any Pre-Closing Tax Return (after giving
effect to any valid extensions thereof), NewCo Seller shall provide Buyer with
a draft of such Tax Return for Buyers review and comment. Buyer shall provide
any written comments to NewCo Seller not later than 10 days after receiving
any such Pre-Closing Tax Return and, if Buyer does not provide any written
comments with ten (10) days, the Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted such
Pre-Closing Tax Return. Seller Representative and Buyer shall attempt to
negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute with respect to such Pre-
Closing Tax Return. If Seller Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve
any such dispute at least ten (10) days before the due date for any such Pre-
Closing Tax Return (after giving effect to any valid extensions thereof) the
dispute shall be referred to the Neutral Auditor for resolution on or before
the due date for any such Pre-Closing Tax Return (after giving effect to any
valid extensions thereof) and the fees shall be shared one-half by Seller
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) and one-half by Buyer.

 

 (d) _Straddle Periods_. With respect to any Straddle Period of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, the Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and
the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date will be
determined in the following manner: (i) in the case of any sales or use
Taxes, value added Taxes, employment Taxes, withholding Taxes, and any Tax
based on or

 



-43-  measured by income, receipts, or profits earned during a Straddle Period, by
assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods,
one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at
the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income,
gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Company or its Subsidiaries for the
Straddle Period will be allocated between such two taxable years or periods
on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company
were closed at the close of the Closing Date; _provided_ that, exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the
deduction for depreciation, will be apportioned between such two taxable years
or periods on a daily basis; and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in
clause (i) above, such Taxes will be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
either the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date or the number of calendar days in the Straddle
Period beginning the day after the Closing Date, as the case may be, and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period.

 

 (e) _Tax Refunds_. The NewCo Seller will be entitled to any Tax refunds
or credits of overpayments of Tax that are received by Buyer, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that relate to any taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date, to the extent that any such Tax refunds or credits of
overpayments of Tax were not taken into account in the calculation of Closing
Net Working Capital, in each case, net of any Taxes or reasonable out-of-
pocket costs attributable to obtaining such Tax refunds or credits of
overpayments of Tax. Notwithstanding this _Section_ __ _ 7.07(e)_, if, after
the Closing, Buyer, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates is required to pay any Tax liabilities imposed with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company and its Subsidiaries that were not
included in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price (" _Excess Tax
Liabilities_ "), the aggregate amount of any Tax refunds or credits of
overpayments of Tax required to be paid to the NewCo Seller pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.07(e)_ will be reduced by the amount of such Excess Tax
Liabilities. Buyer, the Company, and each of its Subsidiaries shall
reasonably cooperate with Seller Representative to make any filings and
elections necessary to secure such Tax refunds or credits of overpayments of
Tax of which it is aware, or reasonably promptly following notice by Seller
Representative of the availability thereof, and Buyer shall cause the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary to pay to NewCo Seller any such Tax refunds or
credits of overpayments of Tax within five days after the actual receipt or
utilization of such Tax refunds or credits of overpayments of Tax. If, after
any payment is made to the NewCo Seller pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.07(e)_, any Tax Authority disallows any Tax refunds or credits of
overpayments of Tax paid to the NewCo Seller, NewCo Seller shall repay to
Buyer such disallowed amount within fifteen (15) days of Buyers request
therefor.

 

 (f) _Retention Payment Tax Benefit_. The cash Tax savings resulting from
any Transaction Tax Deductions directly resulting from the payment of the
Retention Bonuses to the Retention Employees after the Closing Date (the "
_Retention Payment Tax Benefit_ ") shall be for the account of the Sellers,
and, no later than five (5) days following the date on which Buyer, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries files an income Tax Return for the taxable
period in which the Retention Bonuses are paid (which for this purpose shall
not include any payment of estimated Taxes), Buyer shall pay an amount in
cash equal to the Retention Payment Tax Benefit attributable to such income
Tax Return to the NewCo Seller. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.07(f)_,
the amount of the Retention Payment Tax Benefit shall be equal to the
reduction in the income Tax liability of Buyer, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries attributable to any Transaction Tax Deductions

 



-44-  directly resulting from the payment of the Retention Bonuses, calculated on
a with-and-without basis with such Transaction Tax Deductions treated as the
last deductions claimed in the taxable period of the Retention Bonus payment.
Notwithstanding this _Section_ __ _ 7.07(f)_, if, after the Closing, Buyer,
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates is required
to pay any Excess Tax Liabilities, the aggregate amount of any payment
required to be paid to the NewCo Seller pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.07(f)_ will be reduced by the amount of such Excess Tax Liabilities. If,
after any payment is made to the NewCo Seller pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.07(f)_, any Tax Authority disallows any cash Tax savings resulting from any
Transaction Tax Deductions that were paid to the NewCo Seller, the NewCo
Seller shall repay to Buyer such disallowed amount within fifteen (15) days of
Buyers request therefor.

 

 (g) _Tax Contests_. Buyer shall notify the Seller Representative in
writing of the commencement of any examination, proceeding, or audit of any
income Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries reporting flow-through
Tax items of the Sellers or the NewCo Seller and any other proposed change or
adjustment, claim, dispute, arbitration or litigation of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that could result in a
liability to or otherwise impact the Sellers or the NewCo Seller or could
impact the amount of any Tax refund or Retention Payment Tax Benefit
otherwise payable to the NewCo Seller hereunder (" _Tax Claims_ "). Such
notice shall describe the asserted Tax Claim in reasonable detail and shall
include copies of any notices and other documents received from any
Governmental Body in respect of any such asserted Tax Claim. Seller
Representative shall have the right to control the defense of any Tax Claim,
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall have the opportunity to participate
in any such Tax Claim at its own expense. With respect to any Tax Claim
controlled by Seller Representative, Seller Representative shall provide Buyer
with copies of all correspondence, notices or other written
materials received from any Governmental Body, and shall otherwise keep Buyer
advised of significant developments in the Tax Claim, and of significant
communications involving representatives of the Tax Authorities.

 

 (h) _Post-Closing Actions_. Without the prior written consent of
Seller Representative, Buyer will not, and will not permit the Company or its
Subsidiaries to, make, change or rescind any Tax election with retroactive
effect to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, amend or
refile any income Tax Return, engage in any voluntary disclosure or similar
process with a Governmental Body, extend the statute of limitations with
respect to any Tax, in each case solely with respect to any income Tax or
income Tax Return reporting flow-through Tax items of the Sellers or the
NewCo Seller, or that could reasonably be expected to result in a liability to
or otherwise impact the Sellers or the NewCo Seller or could impact the amount
of any Tax refund or Retention Payment Tax Benefit otherwise payable to the
NewCo Seller hereunder.

 (i) _Purchase Price Allocation_. Buyer and Sellers agree that all
amounts properly treated as purchase price for the Shares for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes shall be allocated among the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Asset Allocation_ "). Buyer shall
prepare a proposed Asset Allocation and deliver it to Sellers within ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date for the review and comment of Sellers.
Sellers and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to resolve any disputed items
on such proposed Asset Allocation, _provided_ that if Sellers and Buyer cannot
come to a mutual agreement on the Asset Allocation, the matter shall
be resolved in

 



-45-  accordance with substantially identical procedures as set forth for the
resolution of disputes in _Section_ __ _ 1.04(c)_. Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Sellers from time to time revised copies of the Asset Allocation
to reflect any adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder, and such revised
Asset Allocation shall be subject to the same review process as described in
the preceding sentence. No party hereto shall take any position inconsistent
with the Asset Allocation (as finally determined) on any applicable Tax Return
unless otherwise required pursuant to a determination (as defined in Section
1313(a) of the Code) of a Tax Authority. In the event the final Asset
Allocation is disputed by any Governmental Body, the party receiving notice of
such dispute shall promptly notify the other, and the Sellers and Buyer shall
consult in good faith as to how to resolve such dispute in a manner
consistent with such allocation.

 

 (j) _Pre-Closing Reorganization_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers and
the Company shall effectuate, or cause to be effectuated, the following
transactions (the " _Pre-Closing Reorganization_"):

 

 (i) The Sellers shall incorporate a new Delaware corporation ("
_NewCo Seller_ ");

 (ii) The Sellers shall transfer all of the outstanding stock of the
Company held by the Sellers, which shall constitute all of the Shares, to
NewCo Seller, such that the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
NewCo Seller;

 

 (iii) The Sellers shall cause NewCo Seller to file Form 8869 with the
Internal Revenue Service electing for the Company to be treated as a
"qualified subchapter S subsidiary" for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
together with any additional filings required to make such election applicable
for state and local income Tax purposes, as applicable;

 (iv) The Sellers and NewCo Seller shall cause the Company to convert from
a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington into a
limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in
accordance with applicable Law; and

 

 (v) Prior to Closing, the Company shall distribute to Sellers, or if
after the Pre-Closing Reorganization, to NewCo Seller, the marketable
securities set forth on _Schedule 7.07(j)(v)_ and any marketable securities
acquired after the date of this Agreement by the Company and
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such marketable
securities are not distributed prior to Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to, transfer such non-distributed marketable
securities to NewCo Seller at NewCo Sellers sole cost and expense.

 

 (k) _Tax Treatment_. The parties hereto agree that for applicable income
Tax purposes: (i) the transactions set forth in _Sections 7.07(j)(i)_ through
_(iv)_ are intended to be treated as a reorganization of the Company
described in Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, and (ii) the purchase of the Shares by Buyer is
intended to be treated as a taxable acquisition of the assets of the Company.
No party hereto shall take any position inconsistent with the foregoing
treatment on any applicable Tax Return unless otherwise required pursuant to
a determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code) of a Tax
Authority.

that (i) no termination may be made under this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)_ if
the failure to consummate the Closing by the Outside Date was caused by the

_Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)_ and (ii) if the satisfaction, or waiver by the
appropriate party, of all of the conditions contained in _Sections 8.02_ and

_Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_ would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, (i) if such breach is curable by the Company or Sellers, then Buyer may
not terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)_ unless such
breach has not been cured by the date which is the earlier of (A) two Business
Days prior to the Outside Date and (B) thirty (30) days after Buyer notifies
the Company and Sellers of such breach and (ii) the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)_ will not be available to
Buyer at any time that Buyer is then in breach of any covenant, agreement
or representation and warranty hereunder, in each case such that the

and non-appealable, or any Law enacted or promulgated by any Governmental
Body is in effect that prevents or makes illegal the consummation of the
Transaction; _provided_ that, the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(e)_ shall not be available to a party if the
issuance of, or failure to resolve or have vacated or lifted, such Order was
primarily due to a breach by such party of any of its covenants or agreements
under this Agreement, including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.03_; and

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 9.01_ shall give written notice of such termination to the other party.

__ _ 9.02_ and _ARTICLE_ __ _ XI_ will survive any termination of this
Agreement and (c) except that no such termination will relieve any party from
any liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, costs or expenses (which the
parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out of pocket costs, and may include to the extent proven the
benefit of the bargain lost by the Company and/or Sellers, taking into
consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and
the time value of

 



-49-  money, which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such Persons)
relating to such partys Willful Breach of this Agreement.

 

9.03 _Buyer Termination Fee_

 

 (a) If (i) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company and the
Seller Representative, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)_ as a result of a
material breach under _Section_ __ _ 10.03_, or  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(e)_
and (ii) all conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.01(a)_ or _Section_ __
_ 8.01(b)_ (in the case of any Law in respect of or under the Antitrust
Approvals) have not been satisfied as of the date of such termination but all
other conditions to Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, _Section_ __ _
8.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ shall otherwise have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but
which conditions would have been satisfied if the Closing Date were the date
of such termination), then concurrently with such termination (in the case of
a termination by Buyer) or within three (3) Business Days following such
termination (in the case of a termination by the Company and Sellers), Buyer
shall pay to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds an
amount equal to $55,000,000 (such amount, the " _Termination Fee_ ").

 

 (b) Buyer, the Company, Sellers and the Seller Representative acknowledge
that (i) the Termination Fee and other provisions of this _Section_ __ _
9.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
without these agreements, Buyer, the Company and Sellers would not enter
into this Agreement, (iii) any amount payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
9.03_ does not constitute a penalty but is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company and its Affiliates in
the circumstances in which such amounts are payable for the efforts and
resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (iv) without limiting
the foregoing clause (iii), any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 9.03_ are first treated as a reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred
by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and,
thereafter, as proceeds of a disposition of rights of the Company under this
Agreement. If Buyer fails to promptly pay or cause to be paid the Termination
Fee pursuant to the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.03_, and, in order to
obtain the Termination Fee, the Company commences a suit against Buyer that
results in a judgement against Buyer for the Termination Fee (or any portion
thereof) pursuant to this Agreement rendered by a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.17_, Buyer shall pay to the
Company the reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company in connection with such suit for the
Termination Fee (the " _Buyer Termination Fee Damages_ ").

 

 (c) If (i) this Agreement is terminated is validly terminated by the
Company and the Seller Representative, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the
other hand, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)_ as
a result of a material breach under _Section_ __ _ 10.03_, or  _Section_ __
_ 9.01(e)_ and (ii) all conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.01(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)_ (in the case of any Law in respect of or under the
Antitrust Approvals) have not been satisfied as of the date of such
termination but all other conditions to Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.01_, _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ shall otherwise
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at Closing, but which conditions would have been satisfied if the
Closing Date were the

 



-50-  date of such termination), Buyer shall not have any liability or obligation
as a result of, in connection with, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any other documents and
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby except Buyers obligation to pay
the Termination Fee and any Buyer Termination Fee Damages; provided that the
foregoing shall not impair the rights of the Company and/or Sellers to obtain
injunctive relief pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.16_ prior to any termination
of this Agreement.

 

9.04 _Certain Other Effects of Termination_. If this Agreement is
terminated by Sellers, the Company or Buyer as provided in _Section_ __ _
9.01_, the Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect and
survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of two years following
the date of such termination (and, notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the
Confidentiality Agreement term will be automatically amended to be extended
for such additional two year period).

 

ARTICLE X.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS

10.01 _Further Assurances_. From time to time at and after the Closing
Date, as and when requested by any party hereto and at the requesting partys
expense, any other party will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such documents and instruments and will take, or cause to
be taken, all such further or other actions as such requesting party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the
Transactions.

 

10.02 _Employee_ _Matters_.

 

 (a) _Compensation and Benefits_. Except as set forth on _Schedule
10.02(a)_ , effective as of the Closing Date and continuing for a period of
at least one year thereafter, Buyer will, or will cause the Company, a
Subsidiary of the Company, or one of Buyers other Affiliates to, provide each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately following the
Closing (each, a " _Retained Employee_ "), who remains in the employment of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), compensation (other than equity compensation) and employee
benefits (other than any change in control, transaction, retention or similar
bonuses) that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided by
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Retained Employees immediately before
the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) for a period beginning on the
Closing Date and continuing for a period of at least one year thereafter,
Buyer will, or will cause the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company, or one of
Buyers other Affiliates to provide to each Retained Employee who remains in
the employment of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) with (A) a base salary or wage rate and annual
cash bonus opportunity, (B) termination and severance benefits, taking into
account each such Retained Employees additional period of service and any
increase in the rate of base pay or wages and bonus target at Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) following the
Closing, and (C) the opportunity to receive rates of fixed and discretionary
Matching Contributions and Employer Discretionary Contributions (as such terms
are defined in the Exotic Metals Forming Company LLC Profit Sharing
Retirement and 401(k) Plan) under a tax qualified defined contribution plan of
Buyer or its Affiliates) taking into account the rates in effect for the plan
year ending August 31, 2019, in the case of clauses (A), (B), and (C), in
amounts that, when taken together, are no less favorable to the compensation,

-51-  and opportunities in effect for such Retained Employee immediately before
the Closing, and (ii) following the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause the
Company, a Subsidiary of the Company, or one of Buyers other Affiliates to
continue and maintain the Companys Acknowledgement Appreciation Award bonus
policy, as in effect on the date hereof, with respect to those Retained
Employees that qualify for such benefit as of, or within the first two years
following, the Closing Date. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_ will
obligate Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to continue (and will
not prevent Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from modifying or
terminating) the employment of any such Retained Employee.

 

 (b) _Service Credit_. Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall treat, and shall cause each
plan, program, policy, practice and arrangement sponsored or maintained by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) on
or after the Closing Date and in which any Retained Employee (or the spouse,
domestic partner or dependent of any Retained Employee) participates or is
eligible to participate (each, a " _Buyer Plan_ ") to treat, for all purposes
(including for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting
and level of benefits), all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (and any predecessor employers if the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any Plan provides past service credit) as
service with Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_
, that such service need not be counted to the extent it would result in
duplication of benefits and such service need only be credited to the same
extent and for the same purpose as such service was credited under the
corresponding Buyer Plan.

 

 (c) _Welfare Benefits_. Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall
cause each Buyer Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA, (i) to waive any and all eligibility waiting periods,
actively-at-work requirements, evidence of insurability requirements, pre-
existing condition limitations and other exclusions and limitations regarding
the Retained Employees and their spouses and dependents to the extent waived,
satisfied or not imposed under the corresponding Benefit Plan, and (ii) to
recognize for each Retained Employee for purposes of applying annual
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums under such Buyer Plan any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Retained
Employee and his or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents under the
corresponding Plan during the plan year of such Plan in which the date on
which such Retained Employee begins participating in such Buyer Plan.

 (d) _Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays_. Buyer will cause the Company
to continue to credit to each Retained Employee all vacation and personal
holiday pay that the Retained Employee is entitled to use but has not used as
of the Closing Date, including any earned vacation or personal holiday pay to
be used in future years, and will assume all liability for the payment of such
amounts to the extent such liability is appropriately accrued in the Financial
Statements or included in Closing Net Working Capital. 

 (e) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.02_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this
Agreement and nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ will (i) confer
any rights or remedies, including any third-party beneficiary rights, upon
any employee or former employee of the Company, any Retained Employee or upon
any other Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns, (ii) be construed to establish, amend, or modify any Plan or any
other benefit plan, program, agreement

 



-52-  or arrangement or (iii) subject to compliance with the other provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, alter or limit Buyers or the Companys or any of
its Subsidiaries ability to amend, modify or terminate any specific benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time.

 

10.03 _Antitrust Notification_ _s_.

 

 (a) The Company and Buyer will, as promptly as practicable and no later
than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, file with
the United States Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of
Justice, any notification form required pursuant to the HSR Act for the
Transactions. In addition, each party agrees to make, cause to be made, or
coopering in the making of any filing required under the antitrust or
competition law identified in _Schedule 3.21(b)_ as promptly as practicable
following the date of this agreement. To the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law, each of the Company and Buyer will furnish to each others
counsel such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission that is necessary under any Antitrust Approval and will provide any
supplemental information requested by any Governmental Body as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Sellers, the Company and Buyer will use reasonable
best efforts to comply as promptly as reasonably practicable with any
requests made by any Governmental Body for any additional information in
connection with such filings. Buyer will be responsible for all filing fees
payable in connection with such filings.

 (b) Subject to the immediately following sentence, the Sellers,
the Company and Buyer will use their reasonable best efforts to promptly
obtain any Antitrust Approvals for the consummation of the Transactions and
will keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of any communications
with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, any
Governmental Body and will comply promptly with any such inquiry or request.
Buyer will take, and will cause its Affiliates to take, any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Body or any other Person so as to enable
the parties to expeditiously close the Transactions, including (i) opposing
any motion or action for a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction or
order against or preventing or delaying the consummation of the Transactions,
(ii) entering into a consent decree, consent agreement or other agreement or
arrangement containing Buyers or, effective as of or following the Closing,
the Companys agreement to hold separate, license, sell and/or divest
(pursuant to such terms as may be required by any Governmental Body) such
assets or businesses of Buyer and its Affiliates after the
Closing, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including entering into customary ancillary agreements relating
to any such sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such assets or
businesses), and (iii) agreeing to any such limitations on conduct or actions
of members of Buyer and its Affiliates after the Closing, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as may be required in
order to obtain satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 8.01(a)_ before the Outside Date (all such actions, " _Remedial Actions_
"). Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, neither the
provisions of this Section nor any other provision of this Agreement will be
construed to require Buyer of any of its Subsidiaries to undertake (or to
request or authorize the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries to
undertake) any Remedial Action that would, or would reasonably be expected
to, individually or taken together with all other Remedial Actions, result in
a Material Adverse Remedial Action. The Company and its Subsidiaries will
cooperate with Parent to implement any Remedial Actions, and will agree
to any Remedial Action to the extent

 



-53-  and only as directed by Buyer, so long as the effectiveness of such Remedial
Action is conditioned on the Closing.

 

 (c) The parties hereto commit to instruct their respective counsel to
cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate and
expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR
Act or other applicable antitrust or competition laws at the earliest
practicable dates. Such reasonable best efforts and cooperation include
counsels undertaking (i) to keep each other appropriately informed of
material communications from and to personnel of the reviewing Governmental
Bodies and (ii) to confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts with
and response to personnel of such Governmental Bodies and the content of any
such contacts or presentations, in each case, to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law. None of the Company, Sellers or Buyer will participate in any
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Body with respect to any such
filings, applications, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other
party reasonable prior notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the
extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting or discussion (which, at the request of
Sellers, Buyer or the Company, will be limited to outside antitrust counsel
only). The parties will have the right to review (subject to appropriate
redactions for confidentiality and attorney-client privilege concerns) and
approve the content of each others presentations, white papers or other
written materials to be submitted to any Governmental Body in advance of any
such submission. The parties may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material" or some similar notation agreed by
the parties, and such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient or its Affiliates unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials or its legal counsel. Buyer will control and
lead all communications and strategy related to any filings, analyses,
reviews, approvals, consents, submissions, or other dealings with any
Governmental Body in connection with the Transactions under the HSR Act or any
applicable antitrust or competition laws.

 

 (d) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, Buyer will not
take any action, or refrain from taking any action, the effect of which would
be to materially delay or impede the ability of the parties to consummate the
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer will
not, and will not permit any member of the Buyer Group to, acquire or agree
to acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner), any Person or
portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the
entering into a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such
acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (i)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase
the risk of not obtaining, any approvals of any Governmental Body necessary
to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period, (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Body entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
Transactions or (iii) materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 

10.04 _Certain Consents_. Buyer knowingly, willingly, irrevocably, and
expressly acknowledges and agrees that consents to the Transactions may be
required from the parties to the contracts set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 3.11_
and that such consents have not been obtained as of the date 

 



-54-  of this Agreement and may not be obtained. Buyer knowingly, willingly,
irrevocably, and expressly acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement, subject to the Companys and Sellers
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ in all material respects, neither the
Company nor any of the Seller Parties will have any liability whatsoever to
Buyer, including, for the avoidance of doubt, through any reduction in, or
deduction from, the Purchase Price (whether through any increase in Closing
Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses or any decrease in Closing Net Working
Capital or otherwise) in accordance with this Agreement, and Buyer will not
be entitled to assert any claims, in each case, arising out of or relating to
the failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in
connection with the Transactions (other than the Antitrust Approvals) or
because of the default, acceleration or termination of or loss of any right
under any such contract or other agreement as a result of the Closing and the
failure to obtain any such consent. Further, Buyer knowingly, willingly,
irrevocably, and expressly acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement, subject to the Companys and Sellers
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_ in all material respects, no
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained herein will be
breached or deemed breached and no condition of Buyer will be deemed not to be
satisfied as a result of the failure to obtain any such consent or as a result
of any such default, acceleration or termination or loss of any right or any
action commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any such consent or any such default,
acceleration or termination or loss of any right.

 

10.05 _Affiliate Contracts_. The Company and Sellers will cause the
termination, effective no later than the Closing, of the contracts or
arrangements set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 10.05_ without any further cost or
Liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries (or, after the Closing, Buyer or
its Affiliates). At or prior to Closing, the Company and Sellers shall
provide Buyer with reasonably satisfactory evidence of the termination of all
contracts or arrangements required to be terminated pursuant to the preceding
sentence.

 

10.06 _Name Use_. From and after the Closing, Buyer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve the goodwill associated with the "Exotic
Metals" tradename by continuing to operate the business using such tradename
until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ that, such
tradename may be incorporated with Buyers own tradenames if done in a manner
that is consistent with Buyers naming and branding conventions for other
similarly sized divisions or subsidiaries.

 

10.07 _RWI Policy_. Promptly following the Closing, the Buyer shall
deliver a complete and accurate copy of any representations and warranties
insurance policy, including all riders, certificates, declarations and
attachments thereto, that it obtained in connection with the Transactions (a "
_RWI Policy_ ").

MISCELLANEOUS

 

11.01 _Survival; Certain Waivers_.

 

 (a) Each of the representations and warranties and the covenants and
agreements (to the extent such covenant or agreement contemplates or requires
performance by such party prior to the Closing) of the parties set forth in
this Agreement or any other document

 



-55-  contemplated hereby, or in any certificate delivered hereunder or
thereunder, will terminate effective immediately as of the Closing; _provided_
, that the foregoing shall not limit claims of Fraud by a party hereto based
on the representation and warranties set forth in this Agreement against the
party hereto alleged to have committed such Fraud. Each covenant and agreement
that by its terms is required to be performed at or after the Closing, will,
in each case, expressly survive Closing in accordance with its terms, and if
no term is specified, then for the maximum duration permitted under applicable
Law, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_ will be deemed to limit
any rights or remedies of any Person for breach of any such surviving covenant
or agreement (with it being understood that Buyer will also be liable for
breach of any covenant or agreement requiring performance by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing, and that nothing herein will limit
or affect Buyers or any of its Affiliates liability for the failure to pay
the Purchase Price (in whole or in part) or pay any other amounts payable by
them (in whole or in part) as and when required by this Agreement).

 (b) From and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, Buyer (including, after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly waives, on its
own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action any of them may have against any Seller Party (excluding any
Person who continues to be an officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing, but only in such Persons capacity as such)
relating to the operation or ownership of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses, or relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby, or the Transactions, in
each case, whether or not arising under, or based upon, any Law (including
any right, claim or cause of action arising under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act or any other
Environmental Law, and any other right, claim, or cause of action, whether
arising at law or in equity, to seek indemnification, contribution, cost
recovery, damages, or any other recourse or remedy) (other than, and solely
with respect to, any of the covenants that survive the Closing in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_). Furthermore, from and after the Closing,
without limiting the generality of this _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, no action, suit, claim, investigation
or proceeding will be brought, encouraged, supported or maintained by, or on
behalf of, any member of the Buyer Group (including, after the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) or the Seller Parties against any of the Seller
Parties or Buyer (excluding any Person who continues to be an officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing, but only
in such Persons capacity as such), as the case may be, and no recourse will
be sought against any of them, by virtue of, or based upon, any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of Sellers, the Company or any other
Person set forth or contained in this Agreement or any other document
contemplated hereby or any certificate, instrument, opinion, agreement or
other document of Sellers, the Company or any other Person delivered hereunder
or in connection with the Transactions (other than, and solely with respect
to, any of the covenants that survive the Closing in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 11.01(a)_), the subject matter of this Agreement or any other document
contemplated hereby, the Transactions, the business, the ownership,
operation, management, use or control of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any of their assets, or any actions or omissions at, or prior
to, the Closing.

 

 (c) Buyer and Sellers knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly
acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group
or the Seller Parties,

 



-56-  as the case maybe, that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _
11.01_ (i) require performance after the Closing to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law and will survive the Closing for the maximum
duration permitted under applicable Law and will not be subject to any of the
survival or exclusive remedy provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.01_; and
(ii) are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without the
agreements set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, none of the parties would
enter into this Agreement.

 

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this  _Section_ __ _
11.01_ shall limit claims of Fraud against the party alleged to have committed
such Fraud.

assets, liabilities, properties, contracts, and prospects of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and, in making its determination to proceed with the
Transactions, Buyer has relied solely on the results of its own independent
investigation and verification and has not relied on, is not relying on, and
will not rely on, any of Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries, that certain

Sellers expressly and specifically set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ IV_, in each
case, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules and Updated Schedules and the

acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group,
that: (i) the representations and warranties of the Company expressly and
specifically set forth in  _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_ and of Sellers expressly and
specifically set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ IV_, in each case, as qualified by
the Disclosure Schedules and Updated Schedules and in accordance with the
express terms and conditions (including limitations and exclusions) of this
Agreement, are the sole and exclusive representations, warranties, and
statements of any kind made to Buyer and on which Buyer may rely in connection
with the Transactions; and (ii) all other representations, warranties and
statements of any kind or nature expressed or implied, whether in written,
electronic or oral form, including (A) the completeness or accuracy of, or any
omission to state or to disclose, any information, including the Information
Presentation, the _Dataroom_ , the Projections, meetings, calls or

(B) any other statement relating to the historical, current or future
business, financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities,
properties, contracts, and prospects of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or the quality, quantity or condition of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries assets, are, in each case, specifically disclaimed by Sellers
and the Company, on their own behalf and on behalf of any Seller Parties.
Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, knowingly,
willingly, irrevocably and expressly: (x) disclaims reliance on the items in
clause (ii) in the immediately preceding sentence and (y) acknowledges and
agrees that it has relied on, is only relying on and will only rely on, the
items in clause (i) in the immediately preceding sentence. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Buyer knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and

 



-57-  expressly acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of the
Buyer Group, that neither the Company, nor any other Person (including the
Seller Parties), has made, is making or is authorized to make, and Buyer, on
its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, hereby knowingly, willingly
and irrevocably waives, any warranty or representation (whether in written,
electronic or oral form), express or implied, as to the quality,
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or condition of any
Sellers or the Companys or its Subsidiaries business, operations, assets,
liabilities, prospects or any portion thereof, except solely to the
extent expressly set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_ or _ARTICLE_ __ _ IV_, in
each case, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules and Updated Schedules and
the terms and conditions of, including the limitations and exclusions in,
this Agreement.

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection
with the investigation by Buyer of Sellers and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Buyer and its Affiliates, and the representatives of each of the
foregoing, have received or may receive, from or on behalf of Sellers or
the Company, certain projections, forward-looking statements and other
forecasts (whether in written, electronic or oral form, and including in the
Information Presentation, Dataroom or management meetings) (collectively, "
_Projections_ "). Buyer knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly

that (i) such Projections are being provided solely for the convenience
of Buyer to facilitate its own independent investigation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
such Projections, (iii) Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, and (iv)
Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all Projections (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such Projections).

 

 (c) Buyer knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledges
and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, that it will
not assert, institute or maintain, and will cause the members of the Buyer
Group not to assert, institute or maintain, any action, suit, claim,
investigation, or proceeding of any kind whatsoever, including a
counterclaim, cross-claim, or defense, regardless of the legal or equitable
theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed,
that makes any claim contrary to the agreements and covenants set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 11.02_, including any such action, suit, claim,
investigation, or proceeding with respect to the distribution to Buyer or any
member of the Buyer Group, or Buyers or any member of the Buyer Groups use,

information, statements, disclosures, or materials, in each case whether
written or oral, provided by them or any other Seller Party or any failure of

and that, without these agreements set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.02_,
the Company and Sellers would not enter into this Agreement.

 



-58- 11.03 _Provision Respecting Representation of Company_. Each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its directors, members, partners, managers, members, officers, employees and
Affiliates, (a) that Perkins Coie LLP has been retained by, and may serve as
counsel to, each and any of the Seller Parties, on the one hand, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Transactions, (b) that Perkins Coie
LLP has not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in connection with the
Transactions and that none of the other parties hereto has the status of a
client of Perkins Coie LLP for conflict of interest or any other purposes as
a result thereof, and (c) that, following consummation of the Transactions,
Perkins Coie LLP (or any of its successors) may serve as counsel to any Seller
Parties or any director, member, partner, manager, officer, employee or
Affiliate of any of the Seller Parties, in connection with any litigation,
action, suit, claim, investigation, proceeding or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding such
representation or any continued representation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, each of the parties hereto (on their own behalf and on behalf of
their Affiliates) hereby consents thereto and knowingly, willingly and
irrevocably waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of
such parties will cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to knowingly,
willingly and irrevocably waive any conflict of interest arising from such
representation. Buyer, the Company and any Seller Parties hereby agree that,
in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer, the
Company, and/or its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and any Seller Parties or
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, Perkins Coie LLP (or any of
its successors) may represent any Seller Parties, and/or such Affiliates in
such dispute even though the interests of any Seller Parties, and/or such
Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries,
and even though Perkins Coie LLP may have represented the Company or its
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for Buyer, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries.
In addition, Buyer agrees that (i) all communications prior to the Closing
among any of the Seller Parties, the Company and its Subsidiaries, any of
their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or Advisors, and
Perkins Coie LLP that relate to the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and closing under, or any dispute arising in connection with, this
Agreement, or otherwise relating to any potential sale of the Company or the
Transactions (the " _Protected Seller Communications_ "), will be deemed to
be privileged and confidential communications, (ii) all rights to such
Protected Seller Communications, the expectation of client confidentiality,
and the control of the confidentiality and privilege applicable thereto,
belong to and will be retained by any Seller Parties, (iii) to the extent any
member of the Buyer Group should discover in its possession after the Closing
any Protected Seller Communications, it will take reasonable steps to preserve
the confidentiality thereof and promptly deliver the same to Sellers, keeping
no copies, and will not by reason thereof assert any loss of confidentiality
or privilege protection, and (iv) Seller Representative (A) will have the
right to take possession and control of all Protected Seller Communications
effectively as of the Closing and (B) if and to the extent Seller
Representative fails to take such possession and control (which failure will
not, alone or in association with any other act or omission, be deemed a
waiver of any of their rights under this _Section_ __ _ 11.03_), then Seller
Representative will have the right to access and copy, from time to time, any
Protected Seller Communication in the possession or control of any member of
the Buyer Group from and after the Closing, during normal business hours and
on not less than 48 hours prior written notice, as Seller Representative
reasonably determines may be necessary or desirable in connection with any
post-Closing legal proceeding,

 



-59-  whether or not such matter is known to any member of the Buyer Group. As to
any such Protected Seller Communications prior to the Closing Date, Buyer, the
Company, and each of its Subsidiaries together with any of their respective
Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, further agree that none of
the foregoing may use or rely on any of the Protected Seller Communications in
any action against or involving any of the Seller Parties or Perkins Coie LLP
after the Closing. The Protected Seller Communications may be used by any
Seller Parties and/or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with
any dispute that relates in any way to this Agreement or the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third
party other than any Seller Parties (solely in their capacity as equityholders
of the Company), on the other hand, the Company and its Affiliates may assert
the attorney-client privilege with respect to Protected Seller Communications
to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such third party.
Buyer and the Seller Parties knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly
acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group
and any Seller Parties, respectively, that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 11.03_ (y) require performance after the Closing to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law and will survive the Closing for
the maximum duration permitted under applicable Law and will not be subject to
any of the survival or exclusive remedy provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.01_;
and (z) are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without the
agreements set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.03_, none of the parties would
enter into this Agreement.

11.04 _Press Releases and Communications_. No press release or
public announcement related to this Agreement or the Transactions (including
any press release or other public announcement disclosing the transaction

11.07 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative and
Buyer; _provided_ , that Buyer may assign this Agreement to any of its
Subsidiaries, provided that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its
obligations under this Agreement.

 

11.08 _Amendment and Waiver_. Except as provided herein, any provision of
this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits hereto may be amended
or waived (a) only in a writing signed by Buyer, the Company, and the Seller
Representative; and (b) subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.04_ with respect to the
waiver of conditions to Closing as of the Closing, any waiver of any
provision of this Agreement will be effective against Buyer, the Company, or
Sellers, only as set forth in a writing executed by such Person; _provided_
that no waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof
will extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent
breach or default.

 

11.09 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, including  _Section_ __ _ 7.05_, and except for _Sections 11.01_ ,
_11.02_ , _11.03_ , _11.09_ and _11.10_ in respect of which each of the Seller
Parties is a third party beneficiary, nothing expressed or referred to
in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties
to this Agreement any legal

 



-62-  or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement
or any provision of this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are
for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with this Agreement without notice or liability to any other
Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

11.10 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any action, suit, claim, investigation, or proceeding based upon, arising out
of or related to this Agreement may only be brought against, the Persons that
are expressly named as parties to this Agreement. Except to the extent named
as a party to this Agreement, and then only to the extent of the specific
obligations of such parties set forth in this Agreement, no past, present or
future shareholder, member, partner, manager, director, officer, employee,
Affiliate, agent or Advisor of any party to this Agreement or any Subsidiary
of the Company will have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
or other obligations or liabilities of any of the parties to this Agreement
or for any action, suit, claim, investigation, or proceeding based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement.

 

11.11 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

 

11.12 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed
to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person.
The headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and will in no way restrict or
otherwise modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.

 

11.13 _Disclosure_ _Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedules have been
arranged for purposes of convenience in separately numbered sections
corresponding to the sections of this Agreement; _however_ , each section of
the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to incorporate by reference all
information disclosed in any other section of the Disclosure Schedules to the
extent the relevance of such information to such other section of the
Disclosure Schedules is reasonably apparent on its face. Capitalized terms
used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the
meanings given to them in this Agreement. The specification of any dollar
amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, the Updated Schedules
or the attached exhibits is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher
or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are not
required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the
ordinary course of business, and no party will use the fact of the setting of
the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this

 



-63-  Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, the Updated Schedules or exhibits in
any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation,
item or matter not set forth or included in this Agreement, the Disclosure
Schedules, the Updated Schedules or exhibits is or is not required to be
disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed
as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of
business. In addition, matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedules and the
Updated Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules and the Updated
Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. No
information set forth in the Disclosure Schedules or the Updated Schedules
will be deemed to broaden in any way the scope of the parties
representations and warranties. Any description of any agreement, document,
instrument, plan, arrangement or other item set forth on any Disclosure
Schedule or Updated Schedule is a summary only and is qualified in
its entirety by the terms of such agreement, document, instrument, plan,
arrangement or item to the extent made available to Buyer. The information
contained in this Agreement, in the Disclosure Schedules, the Updated
Schedules, and exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this
Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein will be deemed to be
an admission by any party hereto to any Person of any matter whatsoever,
including any violation of Law or breach of contract.

 

11.14 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, Escrow Agreement and any other agreements
expressly referred to herein or therein (collectively, " _Transaction
Documents_ "), contain the entire agreement of the parties regarding the
subject matter of this Agreement and the Transactions and supersede all prior
agreements among the parties respecting the sale and purchase of the Company.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises with
respect to this Agreement, the terms and provisions of the execution version
of this Agreement will control and prior drafts of this Agreement and the
documents referenced herein will not be considered or analyzed for any purpose
(including in support of parol evidence proffered by any Person in connection
with this Agreement), will be deemed not to provide any evidence as to the
meaning of the provisions hereof or the intent of the parties with respect
hereto and will be deemed joint work product of the parties.

 

11.15 _Conflict Between Transaction Documents_. The parties hereto agree
and acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement
are in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated by this
Agreement, this Agreement will govern and control.

11.16 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise
breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of
them hereunder to consummate the Transactions. It is accordingly agreed that
(a) the parties hereto will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in _Section_ __ _ 11.17_ without proof of damages or
otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled under this Agreement, (b) the provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.03_ are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that
would result from a breach of this Agreement and will not be construed to
diminish or otherwise impair in any

 



-64-  respect any partys right to specific performance or other equitable relief
and (c) the right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an
integral part of the Transactions and without that right, none of such
Sellers, the Company or Buyer would have entered into this Agreement. The
parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or
other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an
adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
party pursuing an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 11.16_ will not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such Order. If,
before the Outside Date, any party hereto brings any action, in each case in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.17_, to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the
Outside Date will automatically be extended (y) for the period during which
such action is pending, _plus_ 10 Business Days or (z) by such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may
be.

11.17 _Jurisdiction and Exclusive Venue_. Each of the parties
irrevocably agrees that any action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding
of any kind whatsoever, including a counterclaim, cross-claim, or defense,
regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be
sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law
or in equity, or otherwise under any legal or equitable theory, that may be
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or the Transactions brought by any
other party or its successors or assigns will be brought and determined only
in the Delaware Chancery Court and any state court sitting in the State of
Delaware to which an appeal from the Delaware Chancery Court may be validly
taken (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court declines to accept jurisdiction over
a particular matter, any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and
any federal appellate court therefrom), and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with
regard to any such action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement and the Transactions. Each of the
parties agrees not to commence any action, suit, claim or proceeding relating
thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than actions
in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or
award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein, and no party
will file a motion to dismiss any action filed in a state or federal court in
the State of Delaware, on any jurisdictional or venue-related grounds,
including the doctrine of forum non-conveniens. Each party hereby irrevocably
consents to the service of any and all process in any such action, suit, claim
or proceeding by delivery of such process in the manner provided in _Section_
__ _ 11.06_ and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise) in any action, suit, claim or proceeding any claim that service of
process made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.06_ does not constitute
good and valid service of process.

 

11.18 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

 (a) This Agreement, and any action, suit, claim, investigation, or
proceeding of any kind whatsoever, including a counterclaim, cross-claim, or
defense, regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort,
or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise under any legal or equitable
theory,

 



-65-  that may be based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the Transactions
will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the
State of Delaware applicable to agreements executed and performed entirely
within such State without regard to conflicts of law principles of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction that would cause the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware to apply.

 

 (b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT
MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY AND THE TRANSACTIONS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES AND THEREFORE HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT,
CLAIM, INVESTIGATION, OR PROCEEDING BASED ON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY
OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY. EACH PARTY HERETO (i) CERTIFIES THAT NO
ADVISOR OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (ii) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 

11.19 _No Right of Set-Off_. Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of
the Buyer Group, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any rights of
set-off, netting, offset, recoupment, or similar rights that any member of the
Buyer Group has or may have with respect to the payment of the Purchase Price
or any other payments to be made by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any
other document or instrument delivered by Buyer in connection herewith.

 

11.20 _Counterparts_. This Agreement, and any other agreements referred
to herein or therein, and any amendments hereto or thereto, may be executed
in multiple counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signature of
more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute
one and the same instrument. Any counterpart, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine, .pdf or other electronic
transmission, will be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and will be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto will re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract will raise the use of a
facsimile machine, .pdf or other electronic transmission to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile machine, .pdf or other electronic
transmission as a defense to the formation of a contract and each such party
forever waives any such defense.

 

11.21 _Seller Representative_.

 

 (a) The Seller Representative shall act as the representative of the
Sellers.

 



-66- (b) Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints the Seller Representative,
effective as of the Closing, as the representative, exclusive agent, proxy and
attorney-in-fact for such Seller for all purposes of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, including the full power and authority on such Sellers
behalf (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and in the
Transaction Documents, (ii) to make any determinations and settle any matters
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.04_, (iii) to execute and deliver on behalf
of such Seller any amendment to the terms hereof or any Transaction Document (
_provided_ that if any such amendment would adversely and disproportionately
affect any particular Seller, such amendment shall also require the prior
written approval of the Seller so adversely and disproportionately affected,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (iv) subject to the
Seller Representatives compliance in full with its obligations in connection
with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Seller Representative
Engagement Agreement, to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on
behalf of the Sellers which the Seller Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in its sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller
Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of Sellers, except
as expressly provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Seller
Representative Engagement Agreement; and for purposes of clarity, there are no
obligations of the Seller Representative in any other Transaction Document,
schedule, exhibit or the Disclosure Schedules. The Seller Representative shall
be entitled to: (A) rely upon the Seller Payment Instructions, (B) rely upon
any signature believed by it to be genuine, and (C) reasonably assume that a
signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Seller
or other party. The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification granted
to the Seller Representative Group and the Advisory Group hereunder: (I) are
coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death,
incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Seller and shall be binding on
any successor thereto, and (II) shall survive the delivery of an assignment
by any Seller of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the
Adjustment Escrow Account.

 

 (c) The Seller Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed
or replaced by the vote of Sellers with a majority of the Shares of the date
of this Agreement. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive
the resignation or removal of the Seller Representative or any member of the
Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement.

 

 (d) Sellers have caused certain of its representatives to enter into, on
each Sellers behalf, an engagement agreement (the " _Seller Representative
Engagement Agreement_ ") with the Seller Representative to provide direction
to the Seller Representative in connection with its services under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Seller Representative Engagement
Agreement (such Sellers, including their individual representatives,
collectively hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the
Seller Representative nor its members, managers, directors, officers,
contractors, agents and employees (collectively, the " _Seller Representative
Group_ "), shall be liable to any Seller or member of the Advisory Group for
any action or failure to act in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Seller Representatives responsibilities hereunder,
under the Escrow Agreement or under the Seller Representative Engagement
Agreement, unless and only to the extent such action or failure to act
constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct. No member of the Advisory
Group shall be liable to any Seller or Seller Representative for any action or
failure to act in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Seller Representatives responsibilities hereunder, under the

 



-67-  Escrow Agreement or under the Seller Representative Engagement Agreement.
The Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller
Representative Group from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, costs, expenses (including fees, disbursements and costs of
counsel and other skilled professionals and in connection with seeking
recovery from insurers), judgments, fines or amounts paid in
settlement (collectively, the " _Seller Representative Expenses_ ") incurred
without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Seller
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under
the Seller Representative Engagement Agreement. The Sellers shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each member of the Advisory Group from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, costs, expenses
(including fees, disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled
professionals and in connection with seeking recovery from insurers),
judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under the
Seller Representative Engagement Agreement or in connection with this
Agreement. Any Seller Representative Expenses owed to the Seller
Representative may be recovered first, from the Representative Expense Fund,
second, from any distribution of the Adjustment Escrow Fund or Forfeited
Retention Bonus Amount otherwise distributable to NewCo Seller at the time of
distribution, and third, directly from the Sellers. The Sellers acknowledge
that the Seller Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Seller Representative Engagement
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the
Seller Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the
Seller Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities
which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the Seller
Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Seller Representative in performing such actions.

 (e) The Representative Expense Fund shall be held by the
Seller Representative in a segregated client account and shall be used (i)
for the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the Seller Representative
for any Seller Representative Expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the Seller Representative Engagement Agreement, or
(ii) as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group. The Seller Representative
is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice and
shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the
Representative Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Seller Representative is not acting as a withholding
agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Representative
Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The
Sellers will not receive any interest on the Representative Expense Fund and
assign to the Seller Representative any such interest. Subject to
Advisory Group approval, the Seller Representative may contribute funds to
the Representative Expense Fund from any consideration otherwise distributable
to the Sellers. As soon as reasonably determined by the Seller Representative
that the Representative Expense Fund is no longer required to be withheld,
the Seller Representative shall distribute the remaining Representative
Expense Fund (if any) to NewCo Seller.

 

 (f) Any decision, act, omission, consent or instruction of the Seller
Representative in accordance with this Agreement shall constitute a decision
of all Sellers and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Seller and
such Sellers successors as if expressly

 



-68-  confirmed and ratified in writing by such Seller, and all defenses which may
be available to any Seller to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the
Seller Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Seller Representative Engagement Agreement are waived, and
Buyer, the Company and the Escrow Agent may rely upon any decision, act,
omission, consent or instruction of the Seller Representative as being the
decision, act, omission, consent or instruction of each Seller. Each of Buyer,
the Company and the Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by any of Buyer, the Company or the Escrow Agent
in accordance with any such decision, act, omission, consent or instruction
of the Seller Representative.

 

11.22 _Interpretation_. In addition to the definitions referred to or set
forth in this Agreement:

 (a) Accounting terms which are not otherwise defined in this Agreement
have the meanings given to them under GAAP. To the extent that the definition
of an accounting term defined in this Agreement is inconsistent with the
meaning of such term under GAAP, the definition set forth in this Agreement
will control.

 (b) The terms "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and terms of similar
import are references to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. Section, clause, schedule and exhibit references
contained in this Agreement are references to sections, clauses, schedules
and exhibits in or to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified.

 

 (c) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

 

 (d) Where the context permits, the use of the term "or" will be
equivalent to the use of the term "and/or."

 (e) Words denoting any gender will include all genders, including the
neutral gender. Where a word is defined herein, references to the singular
will include references to the plural and vice versa.

 

 (f) All references to "$" and dollars will be deemed to refer to
United States currency unless otherwise specifically provided.

 (g) All references to a day or days will be deemed to refer to a
calendar day or calendar days, as applicable, unless otherwise specifically
provided.

 

 (h) Any document or item will be deemed "delivered," "provided" or
"made available" by the Company or Sellers, as applicable, within the meaning
of this Agreement if such document or item (i) is included in the electronic
Dataroom but only to the extent such information or documents were accessible
to Buyer, its Affiliates and Advisors or (ii) actually delivered or provided
to Buyer or any of Buyers Advisors, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), at
least 24 hours prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



-69- (i) Any reference to any particular Code section or any Law will be
interpreted to include any revision of or successor to that section regardless
of how it is numbered or classified, unless otherwise expressly provided
herein.

 

 (j) Whenever this Agreement requires Buyer to take any action or
contains a representation with respect to Buyer, where applicable or
necessary to give effect to the Transactions, such requirement or
representation shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of its
Subsidiaries formed in connection with the Transactions to take such action
and shall be deemed to include a reference to such Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Buyer to take
any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of Buyer to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

 (k) The word "extent" and the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
simply mean "if".

 

 (l) "Writing", "written" and comparable terms refer to printing, typing
and other means of reproducing words (including electronic media) in a visible
form.

 

 (m) With respect to the determination of any period of time, the
words "from" or "through" mean "from and including" or "through and
including" respectively, and the words "to" and "until" each means "to but
excluding".
