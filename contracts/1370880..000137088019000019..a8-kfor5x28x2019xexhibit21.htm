AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of May 28, 2019 by and among FireEye, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Viking Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub I"), Viking Merger LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub II" and, together with Merger Sub I, the "Merger Subs"), Verodin,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Shareholder Representative
Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, solely in its capacity as
representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of the Indemnifying Parties (the
"Stockholder Representative"). All capitalized terms that are used but not
defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in Annex A.

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the boards of directors or members, as applicable, of each of Parent,
the Merger Subs and the Company have determined that it is advisable and in
the best interests of each corporation or limited liability company and their
respective stockholders or members, as applicable, that Parent acquire the
Company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub I with and into the
Company, pursuant to which the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (the "First Merger") and as part of the same overall transaction,
the surviving entity of the First Merger will merge with and into Merger Sub
II (the "Second Merger" and together with the First Merger, the "Mergers")
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
in accordance with the provisions of Delaware Law, and in furtherance thereof,
have approved this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements (the
"Transactions").

WHEREAS, Parent and the Company intend, by executing this Agreement, that the
Mergers be treated as integrated steps in a single transaction contemplated by
this Agreement and will together qualify as a tax-free reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code and that this Agreement will
be, and is, adopted as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, (i)
each Key Employee listed on Schedule A is accepting an offer letter from
Parent (collectively, the "Key Employee Offer Letter") and (ii) each Key
Employee listed on Schedule A-1 has executed a Non-Competition Agreement in
substantially the form set forth as Exhibit A (the "Non-Competition
Agreement").

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, each
Stockholder listed on Schedule B (each, a "Major Stockholder") has executed
and delivered to Parent a Joinder Agreement in the form set forth in Exhibit B
(a "Joinder"), and an accredited investor questionnaire in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent (an "Accredited Investor Questionnaire").

WHEREAS, based on the Accredited Investor Questionnaires delivered prior to
the execution of this Agreement and other information made available to Parent
by the Company, Parent reasonably believes that no more than thirty-five (35)
of the recipients of Parent Common Stock in the Transactions are not
accredited investors (as such term is used in Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act) and that the issuance of all shares of Parent Common Stock
in the Transactions will validly qualify for an exemption from the
registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act and
the equivalent state "blue-sky" Legal Requirements (the "Share Registration
Exemption"). 

WHEREAS, Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, as more fully set forth
herein, in connection with the Transactions.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
premises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the performance
thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:



ARTICLE I

THE MERGERS

1.1 The Mergers.

(a) First Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and applicable provisions of Delaware Law, on the Closing Date
Parent shall effect the First Merger, whereupon the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub I shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company, as
the surviving corporation after the First Merger, is sometimes referred to
herein as the "First Merger Surviving Corporation." The Merger shall become
effective at the latest time of the filing and acceptance by the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware of the First Merger Certificate of Merger or
such other later time as may be agreed by Parent and the Company and specified
in the First Merger Certificate of Merger (such time the "First Merger
Effective Time").

(b) Second Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and applicable provisions of Delaware Law, within forty-five
(45) days from the Closing Date, Parent shall effect the Second Merger,
whereupon the separate corporate existence of the First Merger Surviving
Corporation shall cease and Merger Sub II shall continue as the surviving
entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub II, as the
surviving entity after the Second Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as
the "Second Merger Surviving Entity." The Second Merger shall become effective
at the latest time of the filing and acceptance by the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware of the Second Merger Certificate of Merger or such other
later time as may be specified in the Second Merger Certificate of Merger
(such time the "Second Merger Effective Time"). For the sake of clarity, it is
intended that the First Merger and the Second Merger are integrated and to be
considered as being performed and occurring as an integrated transaction and
reorganization for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes with the result
being a reorganization as defined in Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

1.2 The Closing.

(a) Closing Time and Location. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to Section 6.1, the First Merger shall be consummated at a closing
(the "Closing") on the date of this Agreement or, if the conditions set forth
in Section 1.2(b) are not satisfied on such day, a date within one (1)
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver (if permissible hereunder)
of the conditions set forth in Section 1.2(b) (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
satisfaction or waiver (if permissible hereunder) of those conditions), at the
offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto,
California, unless another time or place is mutually agreed upon in writing by
Parent and the Company. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs shall
be referred to herein as the "Closing Date."



(b) Closing Conditions.

(i) Conditions to Obligations of Each Party. The respective obligations of
Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company to effect the Mergers shall be subject
to the satisfaction, at or prior to the First Merger Effective Time, of the
following conditions (any of which may be waived only with the written mutual
consent of Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company (it being understood that
each such condition is solely for the benefit of Parent, the Merger Subs and
the Company and may be waived in writing by their written mutual consent
without notice, liability or obligation to any other Person)):

(A) Stockholder Approval. The Requisite Stockholder Approval shall have been
obtained.

(B) Regulatory Approvals. All approvals of Governmental Entities required to
be obtained prior to the First Merger Effective Time in connection with the
Transactions shall have been obtained and the waiting period (and any
extension thereof) under the HSR Act relating to the Transactions shall have
expired or terminated early.

(C) No Legal Impediments. No Legal Requirement (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) shall be in effect which has the effect of making the
Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibiting or preventing consummation of
the Transactions.

(ii) Additional Conditions to the Obligations of Parent and the Merger Subs.
The obligations of Parent and the Merger Subs to effect the Mergers shall be
subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the First Merger Effective Time of
each of the following additional conditions (any of which may be waived, in
writing, exclusively by Parent and the Merger Subs (it being understood that
each such condition is solely for the benefit of Parent and the Merger Subs
and may be waived in writing without notice, liability or obligation to any
other Person)):

(A) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in this Agreement that are qualified by "materiality" or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications set forth in such
representations or warranties shall have been true and correct on the date of

representations and warranties were made on and as of the Closing Date (other
than the representations and warranties of the Company made only as of a
specified date, which shall have been true and correct as of such date) and
all other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement shall have been true and correct in all material respects on the
date of this Agreement and shall be true and correct in all material respects
on the Closing Date as if such representations and warranties were made on and
as of the Closing Date (other than the representations and warranties of the
Company made only as of a specified date, which shall have been true and
correct in all material respects as of such date).

(B) Covenants. The Company shall have performed and complied in all material

be in full force and effect.

and delivered to Parent the Stockholder Written Consents with respect to such

effect.

(F) FIRPTA Certificate. Parent shall have received (i) a notice to the IRS, in

the Treasury Regulations under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent for purposes of satisfying Parent's
obligations under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445‑2(c)(3), in each case,
validly executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company.

(G) Key Employees. The Non-Competition Agreements and each of the Key Employee
Offer Letters executed concurrently with this Agreement shall be in full force
and effect and shall not have been revoked, rescinded or otherwise repudiated
by the respective signatories thereto, and no Key Employee shall have
terminated his or her employment with the Company (or one of the Subsidiaries,
as applicable) or, to the Knowledge of the Company, expressed an intention or
interest in terminating his or her employment with the Company (or one of the
Subsidiaries, as applicable) at or prior to the Closing, or with the Second

(H) Share Registration Exemption. Parent shall be reasonably satisfied that no
more than thirty-five (35) of the potential recipients of Parent Common Stock
or rights to acquire Parent Common Stock (otherwise than pursuant to any
Assumed Options) in connection with the First Merger will fail to be, at the
Closing, "accredited" as defined in Rule 501 promulgated under Regulation D of

capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after the First
Merger Effective Time). Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of
Merger Sub I capital stock will evidence ownership of such shares of Company
Common Stock.

(b) Company Capital Stock; Company Options; Company Warrants.

(i) Generally. At the First Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the First
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Merger Subs, the
Company or the respective stockholders or members thereof, each share of
Company Capital Stock (excluding (A) Cancelled Shares, which shall be treated
in the manner set forth in Section 1.6(b)(ii) and (B) Dissenting Shares, which
shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 1.6(b)(iii)) issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time shall
be cancelled and extinguished and shall be converted automatically into the
right to receive, upon the terms set forth in this Section 1.6 and throughout
this Agreement (subject to the indemnification and escrow provisions set forth
in Article VII) and subject to surrender of the certificate representing such
shares of Company Capital Stock (or receipt by Parent of confirmation from
Carta, pursuant to the Carta Letter, of the cancellation of such certificate)
and the execution and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal and a Joinder
Agreement in the manner provided in Section 1.8:

(A) with respect to each outstanding share of Company Common Stock: (1) the
Per Share Common Stockholder Closing Cash Consideration, (2) the Per Share
Common Stockholder Closing Stock Consideration, (3) the Per Share Escrow
Consideration, and (4) the Per Share Representative Fund Consideration;
provided, however, that with respect to each outstanding share of Company
Restricted Stock, the amounts in the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)
shall continue after the First Merger Effective Time to be subject to the same
vesting or repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other conditions under any
applicable stock restriction agreement or other agreement with the Company to
which such Company Restricted Stock was subject prior to the First Merger
Effective Time, shall not automatically be payable when otherwise due if such
Company Restricted Stock had been Company Common Stock and shall instead
become payable subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and on
such date as such Company Restricted Stock would have ceased to become subject
to any vesting or repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
under any applicable stock restriction agreement or other agreement with the
Company to which such Company Restricted Stock was subject prior to the First
Merger Effective Time;



(B) with respect to each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock: (1)
the Per Share Stockholder Closing Cash Consideration, (2) the Per Share
Stockholder Closing Stock Consideration, (3) the Per Share Escrow
Consideration, and (4) the Per Share Representative Fund Consideration;

(C) with respect to each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock: (1)
the Per Share Series B Stockholder Closing Stock Consideration, (2) the Per
Share Escrow Consideration, and (3) the Per Share Representative Fund
Consideration; and

(D) with respect to each outstanding share of Series Seed Preferred Stock: (1)
the Per Share Stockholder Closing Cash Consideration, (2) the Per Share
Stockholder Closing Stock Consideration, (3) the Per Share Escrow
Consideration, and (4) the Per Share Representative Fund Consideration.

"Merger Consideration" shall mean all of the amounts payable pursuant to the
preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (A) a
portion of the consideration that otherwise would be payable at the Closing to
each Stockholder pursuant to this Section 1.6(b)(i) shall be withheld at the
Closing and (1) deposited into the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(iii)
and (2) deposited into the Representative Fund pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(iv),
which will be distributed to the Stockholders in accordance with, and subject
to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and, as applicable, the Escrow
Agreement, (B) Parent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to pay in
cash in lieu of shares of Parent Common Stock any amounts payable from time to
time hereunder that would otherwise be paid in shares of Parent Common Stock
to any Stockholder that is not a Major Stockholder and (C) any such amounts
paid in cash that would otherwise have been paid in shares of Parent Common
Stock if not for the foregoing clause (B) shall be deducted on a pro rata
basis from the amount of cash consideration payable from time to time to the
Major Stockholders and paid instead in a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock of equivalent value to such deducted amounts with each share valued at
the Parent Trading Price. For purposes of calculating all amounts issuable to
each Stockholder pursuant to this Section 1.6, all shares of Company Capital
Stock held by each Stockholder shall be aggregated on a certificate-by-
certificate basis, the amount of cash consideration due in respect of each
such certificate shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock due in respect of each such
certificate shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. No fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Mergers,
provided, that any Stockholder who otherwise would be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, an
amount of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) such fraction
by (B) the Parent Trading Price, rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

(ii) Cancelled Shares. At the First Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the
First Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Merger Subs,
the Company or the respective stockholders or members thereof, each share of
Company Capital Stock that is issued and outstanding and held by the Company
or any Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time
("Cancelled Shares") shall be cancelled without any consideration paid
therefor.

(iii) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time and with respect to which
the holder thereof has properly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 262 of Delaware Law, and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost
such holder's appraisal rights under Delaware Law (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the applicable consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in
Section 1.6(b)(i) but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights
as are provided by Delaware Law.



Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.6(b)(iii), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holder's appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then,
as of the later of the First Merger Effective Time and the occurrence of such
event, such holder's shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares (or confirmation from Carta, pursuant to the Carta
Letter, of the cancellation of such certificate), upon the terms set forth in
this Section 1.6 and throughout this Agreement (including the indemnification
and escrow provisions set forth in Article VII), the consideration for Company
Capital Stock set forth in Section 1.6(b)(i) without interest thereon. After
the Closing, Parent shall give the Stockholder Representative (A) prompt
notice of any written demand for appraisal received by Parent and/or any of
its Affiliates (including the Second Merger Surviving Entity) pursuant to the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law and (B) the opportunity to control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates (including the Second Merger Surviving Entity), on the
one hand, nor the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, shall make or
authorize any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or
settle any such demands without the prior written consent of the other party,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. After the Closing, any
communication to be made by Parent and/or any of its Affiliates (including the
First Merger Surviving Corporation), on the one hand, and the Stockholder
Representative, on the other hand, to any such demanding Stockholder with
respect to such demands shall be submitted to the other party in advance and
shall not be presented to any such demanding Stockholder prior to such Person
receiving the other party's written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld.

(iv) Treatment of Company Options.

(A) Effect on Vested Company Options. Parent shall not assume any Vested
Company Options, and at the First Merger Effective Time each Vested Company
Option outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time shall,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, the
Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and, subject to
the following sentence and the other terms and conditions set forth throughout
this Agreement, and the applicable delivery requirements in Section 1.8, shall
become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product (rounded to the nearest cent) obtained by multiplying (i) the excess,
if any, of (x) the amount of cash equal to the Per Share Total Consideration
Value over (y) the exercise price per share attributable to such Vested
Company Option by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise in full of such Vested Company Option, less applicable
Tax withholding. The parties acknowledge and agree that any Tax deduction or
expense arising or resulting from the cancellation of any Vested Company
Option or the payment of any amount which is treated as compensation for Tax
purposes, in each case pursuant to this Section 1.6(b)(iv)(A), shall be
allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period for all Tax purposes to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.

(B) Effect on Unvested Company Options held by Continuing Employees. At the
First Merger Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option held by a Continuing
Employee shall be assumed by Parent as a Parent Option. Except as otherwise
set forth in this Agreement, each Unvested Company Option so assumed by Parent
pursuant to this Section 1.6(b)(iv)(B) (an "Assumed Option") shall continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including the
applicable vesting terms) set forth in the Plan and the option agreements
relating thereto as in effect immediately prior to the First Merger Effective
Time, except that (A) such Assumed Option will be exercisable for that number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise in
full of such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the First Merger
Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (B) the per share
exercise price for the shares



of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option shall be
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock at which such applicable Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Closing Date by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up
to the nearest whole cent. It is the intention of the parties that, to the
extent possible, each Assumed Option qualify following the First Merger
Effective Time as an "incentive stock option" (within the meaning of Section
422 of the Code) to the extent that the corresponding Company Option qualified
as an incentive stock option immediately prior to the First Merger Effective
Time. The assumption of Unvested Company Options under this Section
1.6(b)(iv)(B) is intended to comply with Section(s) 409A and 424 of the Code.

(C) Effect on Unvested Company Options held by non-Continuing Employees.
Effective as of the First Merger Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time
and held by a non-Continuing Employee shall be cancelled without payment of
any consideration in respect of such cancelled Unvested Company Option.

(D) Necessary Actions for Company Options and Company Restricted Stock. Prior
to the First Merger Effective Time, and subject to the review and approval of
Parent, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the
transactions anticipated by this Section 1.6 under all Company Option
agreements, all agreements related to Company Restricted Stock and any other
plan or arrangement of the Company (whether written or oral, formal or
informal), including adopting all resolutions, delivering all required
notices, obtaining consents from each holder of a Company Option or Company
Restricted Stock and taking any other actions that are necessary or
appropriate to effectuate Section 1.6(b)(iv)(A) and this Section
1.6(b)(iv)(D).

(v) Treatment of Company Warrants. At the First Merger Effective Time, each
Company Warrant that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately
prior to the First Merger Effective Time shall terminate in its entirety.

1.7 Effect of Second Merger on Capital Stock of Constituent Companies.

(a) Company Capital Stock. Effective as of the Second Merger Effective Time,
by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub II, the Company or the respective stockholders thereof, each share
of capital stock of the Company that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled without any
consideration paid therefor.

(b) Merger Sub II Capital Stock. Effective as of the Second Merger Effective
Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub II, the Company or the respective stockholders or members
thereof, each membership interest of Merger Sub II that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall remain
issued and outstanding.

1.8 Payment of Merger Consideration for Company Capital Stock and Company
Options.

(a) Exchange Agent. American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC shall serve
as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the Mergers.



(b) Parent Closing Payments.

(i) On the Closing Date (or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date)), Parent shall
transfer, or cause to be transferred, to the Exchange Agent the amount of cash
and stock payable to the Stockholders at Closing pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(i)
in exchange for all shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding as of
immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time.

(ii) On the Closing Date (or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date)), Parent
shall transfer, or cause to be transferred, to the Company a cash amount, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company prior to the Closing, equal to the aggregate amount payable in respect
of all Company Options pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(iv), for distribution to the
holders of the Vested Company Options through the Company's payroll system.

(iii) On the Closing Date (or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date)), Parent
shall transfer, or cause to be transferred, the Escrow Amount to the Escrow
Agent to hold in trust as an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") under the terms
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Upon deposit of the Escrow Amount
with the Escrow Agent in accordance with the preceding sentence, Parent shall
be deemed to have contributed each relevant Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of
the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Fund.

(iv) At the First Merger Effective Time, Parent shall transfer the
Representative Expense Amount to the Stockholder Representative to hold (the
"Representative Fund") under the terms of this Agreement. The Representative
Fund will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Stockholder Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this
Agreement and the ancillary agreements. The Stockholders will not receive any
interest or earnings on the Representative Fund and irrevocably transfer and
assign to the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder
Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the
Representative Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Stockholder Representative will hold these funds separate from
its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or
any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Upon deposit of the
Representative Expense Amount with the Stockholder Representative in
accordance with this Section 1.8(b)(iv), for tax purposes Parent shall be
deemed to have paid each relevant Stockholder its, his or her Pro Rata Portion
of the Representative Expense Amount and then each such Stockholder shall be
deemed to have voluntarily contributed such amount to the Representative Fund,
any withholding in respect thereof shall be satisfied from the Total
Stockholder Closing Cash Consideration owing to the Stockholder on the Closing
Date and, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of the Representative Fund
that is returned to the Stockholders shall not again be subject to information
reporting or withholding.

Escrow Consideration, the Per Share Stockholder Closing Cash Consideration,

pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and may be entitled to receive pursuant to Section

receive pursuant to Section 1.6(b) (on a certificate-by-certificate basis and
in the aggregate), (G) the Pro Rata Portion of such holder, (H) the amount of

deposited in the Representative Fund, in each case, on behalf of such holder

a certificate-by-certificate basis and in the aggregate), (J) the amount of
any withholding due on any payment (assuming, solely for purposes of preparing
the Payment Spreadsheet, that such Stockholder has delivered to the Exchange
Agent the appropriate Form W-8, Form W-9 or similar tax form indicating that
no withholding is required) and (K) such other information as required by the
Exchange Agent in the form of spreadsheet provided to the Company prior to the
date hereof; and

and social security number (or tax identification number, as applicable); (B)

Company Options, (K) the amount of cash, if any, to be paid by or on behalf of

outstanding loans between the Company and such Company Optionholder, and (L)

form set forth in Exhibit C (a "Letter of Transmittal") and a Joinder
Agreement to the address set forth opposite each such Stockholder's name on
the Payment Spreadsheet (except to the extent any of such documents have
previously been received by Parent prior to the Closing from such
Stockholder). Promptly (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days)
following receipt by the Exchange Agent of a Letter of Transmittal, a Joinder
Agreement and any applicable tax forms that the Exchange Agent may reasonably
require in connection therewith (except to the



extent any of such documents have previously been received by Parent prior to
the Closing from such Stockholder) (the "Exchange Documents"), duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and a
certificate representing the relevant shares of Company Capital Stock (the
"Company Stock Certificates") (provided, however, such Company Stock
Certificate shall not be required to be delivered to the Exchange Agent if
Carta, pursuant to the Carta Letter, shall have theretofore confirmed the
cancellation of such Company Stock Certificate), Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and/or issue to the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate in exchange therefor the cash and/or stock portion of the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof at Closing pursuant to Section
1.6(b)(i) (less the amount of cash withheld and deposited in the Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(iii) and less the amount of cash withheld and
deposited in the Representative Fund pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(iv)) and the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled (if not already
cancelled by Carta). Until so surrendered (or cancelled by Carta), each
Company Stock Certificate outstanding after the First Merger Effective Time
will be deemed, for all corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only the
right to receive the cash and stock amounts payable hereunder in exchange for
shares of Company Capital Stock (without interest). Subject to Section 1.8(e),
no portion of the Merger Consideration will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to shares of Company
Capital Stock formerly represented thereby until the holder of record of such
Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate
(provided, however, such Company Stock Certificate shall not be required to be
surrendered if Carta, pursuant to the Carta Letter, shall have theretofore
confirmed the cancellation of such Company Stock Certificate) and validly
executed Exchange Documents pursuant hereto. For all purposes under this
Agreement the value attributable to a share of Parent Common Stock shall be
the Parent Trading Price.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Company Stock
Certificate not otherwise held in electronic form immediately prior to the
First Merger Effective Time by Carta, shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent or Parent shall pay and/or issue, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Merger Consideration, if
any, payable and/or issuable in respect thereto pursuant to Section 1.6(b)
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof; provided,
however, that as conditions precedent to the issuance thereof the Stockholder
who is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate shall have
provided an indemnification agreement in a form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Second Merger Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed and to the extent
required by the Exchange Agent, the Stockholder who is the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificates shall have delivered a bond in such amount as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct.

(f) Transfers of Ownership. If any cash amounts or stock are to be disbursed
pursuant to Section 1.6 and this Section 1.8 to a Person other than the Person
whose name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate surrendered (or
confirmed by Carta, pursuant to the Carta Letter, as cancelled) in exchange
therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery thereof that the
certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid
to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered,
or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(g) Shares of Parent Common Stock. The shares of Parent Common Stock issued by
Parent to the Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.6(b), and this Section 1.8
shall be placed in a restrictive class bearing the following restrictive
legend:



THE SHARES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR ANY STATE
SECURITIES LAWS. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE ABSENCE OF AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SAID ACT AND ANY
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAW OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION UNDER
SAID ACT. THE ISSUER OF THESE SHARES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER
OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES
LAWS.

(h) Exchange Agent to Return Merger Consideration. At any time following the
last day of the sixth (6th) month following the First Merger Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent or
its designated successor or assign all cash amounts that have been deposited
with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(i), and any and all
interest thereon or other income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the
holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 1.8(d), and
thereafter the holders of Company Stock Certificates shall be entitled to look
only to Parent, the First Merger Surviving Corporation and/or the Second
Merger Surviving Entity (subject to the terms of Section 1.8(j)) only as
general creditors thereof with respect to any and all cash amounts and stock
that may be payable to such holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to
Section 1.8(d) upon the due surrender of such Company Stock Certificates and
duly executed Exchange Documents in the manner set forth in Section 1.8(d). No
interest shall be payable for the cash amounts delivered to Parent pursuant to
the provisions of this Section 1.8(h) and which are subsequently delivered to
the holders of Company Stock Certificates.

(i) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. Following the
consummation of the Mergers, the cash amounts and stock paid in respect of the
surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock (or delivery of
confirmation from Carta, pursuant to the Carta Letter, of the cancellation of
the certificates representing such shares) in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the First Merger Surviving Corporation or the
Second Merger Surviving Entity of shares of Company Capital Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time. If, after
the First Merger Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to
the First Merger Surviving Corporation or the Second Merger Surviving Entity
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article I.

(j) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
none of Parent, the First Merger Surviving Corporation, the Second Merger
Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any party hereto shall be liable to a
Stockholder for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(k) Statement of Expenses. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a statement that sets forth all Third Party Expenses that are unpaid as
of the Closing, or anticipated to be incurred or payable by or on behalf of
the Company or any Subsidiary after the Closing and wire instructions for each
payment to be made at or after the Closing (the "Statement of Expenses").
Without limitation to any other provision of this Agreement, in making any
payment in respect of any unpaid Third Party Expenses at the Closing and in
calculating the Closing Net Working Capital, Parent shall be entitled to rely
on the Statement of Expenses.



1.9 Withholding Taxes. The Company, the Exchange Agent, the Escrow Agent,
Parent, the First Merger Surviving Corporation and the Second Merger Surviving
Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable
or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law or under any Legal Requirements or
applicable Orders and shall be permitted to pay or cause to be paid any
amounts due under this Agreement through an appropriate payroll service
provider of Parent, the Company, the First Merger Surviving Corporation or the
Second Merger Surviving Entity or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates in
order to facilitate any such deducting or withholding. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity or other Person, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

1.10 Tax Consequences. The Mergers are intended to be treated as integrated
steps in a single transaction and together to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, and this Agreement is
intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3. Each party hereto shall
cause all Tax Returns relating to the Mergers filed by such party to be filed
on the basis of treating the Mergers as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code unless otherwise required by applicable
Legal Requirements.

1.11 Adjustment for Closing Net Working Capital.

(a) Schedule 1.11(a) sets forth (i) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement prepared by
the Company and (ii) the Company's good faith estimate of the amount of Net
Working Capital and all components thereof as if the Closing occurred upon the
execution of this Agreement.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
certificate of the Company (the "Company Pre-Closing Certificate"), validly
executed on its behalf by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, setting
forth (i) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing prepared by the Company and (ii) the Company's
good faith estimate of the amount of Closing Net Working Capital (the
"Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Amount") and all components thereof.
The Company Pre-Closing Certificate shall be prepared in accordance with the
Applicable Accounting Principles. After delivery of the Company Pre-Closing
Certificate and the Payment Spreadsheet, Parent and its accountants and other
representatives shall be permitted reasonable access to the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' Books and Records and any work papers related to the preparation
of the Company Pre-Closing Certificate and Payment Spreadsheet, and the
Company shall, and shall cause its accountants and employees to, reasonably
cooperate with and respond to questions and comments of Parent related to the
Company Pre-Closing Certificate or the Payment Spreadsheet. The process
described in this Section 1.11(b) is not intended to permit the introduction
of different accounting methodologies, practices, estimation techniques,
assumptions and principles to the preparation of the Company Pre-Closing
Certificate from the accounting methodologies, practices, estimation
techniques, assumptions and principles used in the Applicable Accounting
Principles.

(c) No later than ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent
may, but shall not be obligated to, deliver to the Stockholder Representative
a statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth (i) a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing and (ii)
Parent's good faith calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, and the
components thereof, together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation
for such calculations. The Post-Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles. If Parent does not
deliver a Post-Closing



Statement on or before the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date, then
the amount of Closing Net Working Capital estimated in the Company Pre-Closing
Certificate and all amounts therein shall be final and binding and not subject
to appeal.

(d) If Parent delivers a Post-Closing Statement to the Stockholder
Representative in accordance with Section 1.11(c) on or before the ninetieth
(90th) day after the Closing Date, then the Stockholder Representative shall
have sixty (60) calendar days following its receipt of the Post-Closing
Statement (the "Review Period") to review the same together with all
documentation and information related to the Stockholder Representative's
review of the Post-Closing Statement as reasonably requested in accordance
with this Section 1.11(d). During the Review Period, Parent shall provide the
Stockholder Representative with reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the work papers of Parent and its accountants related to the
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement, and Parent shall make reasonably
available its employees involved in the preparation of the Post-Closing
Statement. On or before the expiration of the Review Period, the Stockholder
Representative may deliver to Parent a written statement accepting or
disputing the Post-Closing Statement. In the event that the Stockholder
Representative shall dispute the Post-Closing Statement, such written
statement shall include an itemization of the Stockholder Representative's
objections and the reasons therefor (such statement, a "Dispute Statement").
Any component of the Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Post-Closing
Statement that is not disputed in a Dispute Statement shall be final and
binding and not subject to appeal. If the Stockholder Representative does not
deliver a Dispute Statement to Parent within the Review Period or delivers a
statement accepting the Post-Closing Statement, the Post-Closing Statement and
all amounts therein shall be final and binding and not subject to appeal.

(e) If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Dispute Statement during the
Review Period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative may meet and attempt
in good faith to resolve their differences with respect to the disputed items
set forth in the Dispute Statement during the forty-five (45) calendar days
immediately following Parent's receipt of the Dispute Statement, or such
longer period as Parent and the Stockholder Representative may mutually agree
in writing (the "Resolution Period"). Any such disputed items that are
resolved by Parent and the Stockholder Representative during the Resolution
Period shall be final and binding and not subject to appeal. If Parent and the
Stockholder Representative do not resolve all such disputed items by the end
of the Resolution Period, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may
submit all items then remaining in dispute with respect to the Dispute
Statement to PricewaterhouseCoopers, or if PricewaterhouseCoopers will not so
act, a nationally recognized independent accounting firm upon which Parent and
the Stockholder Representative shall reasonably agree (the "Accounting Firm")
for review and resolution (provided that the Accounting Firm shall not have
provided services to either Parent or the Company previously unless otherwise
agreed in writing by Parent and the Stockholder Representative). The
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator. The Accounting
Firm shall (i) make any calculations in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles, (ii) shall review and determine only those items
remaining in dispute between Parent and the Stockholder Representative, and
(iii) shall only be permitted or authorized to determine an amount with
respect to any such disputed item that is either, or within the numerical
range between, the amount of such disputed item as proposed by Parent in the
Post-Closing Statement or the amount of such disputed item as proposed by the
Stockholder Representative in the Dispute Statement. Each of Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall (A) enter into a customary engagement letter
with the Accounting Firm at the time such dispute is submitted to the
Accounting Firm and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm and (B) have
the opportunity to submit a written statement in support of their respective
positions with respect to such disputed items, to provide supporting material
to the Accounting Firm in defense of their respective positions with respect
to such disputed items and to submit a written statement responding to the
other party's position with respect to such disputed items. Neither Parent nor
the Stockholder Representative shall engage in any



communication of any kind, whether oral or written, with the Accounting Firm
regarding the items included in the Dispute Statement except in the presence
(in person or telephonically) of the other such party, or, in the case of
written communications (including electronic mail), without such other party
simultaneously receiving a copy of any such communications. The Accounting
Firm's sole function shall be to arbitrate each disputed item in accordance
with the requirements of this Agreement and not to conduct its own
investigation or analysis. The Accounting Firm shall allow Parent and the
Stockholder Representative to present their respective positions regarding the
disputed items and shall thereafter as promptly as possible provide the
parties hereto a written determination of each disputed item, and such written
determination shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment
may be entered on the award. The Accounting Firm may, at its discretion,
conduct a conference concerning the disputed items, at which conference each
party shall have the right to present additional documents, materials and
other information and to have present its advisors, counsel and accountants.
In connection with such process, there shall be no other hearings or any oral
examinations, testimony, depositions, discovery or other similar proceedings.
The Accounting Firm shall address only the issues in dispute, shall make its
decision solely on the basis of the evidence and position papers presented to
it and in a manner consistent with the Applicable Accounting Principles. The
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to deliver to Parent and the Stockholder
Representative a written determination (such determination to include a
worksheet setting forth all calculations used in arriving at such
determination and to be based solely on information provided to the Accounting
Firm by Parent and the Stockholder Representative) of the disputed items
within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the disputed items, which
determination shall be final and binding and not subject to appeal, absent
manifest error or fraud. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any,
to be performed by the Accounting Firm will be allocated between Parent, on
the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties), on the other hand, in the same proportion as the
differences between the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to
the Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as
finally determined by the Accounting Firm) and the final total determined
amount of such items so submitted.

(f) The "Final Closing Net Working Capital Amount" shall be the final, binding
and nonappealable amount of Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to the terms
of this Section 1.11. If the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Surplus is
greater than the Final Closing Net Working Capital Surplus, then within five
(5) Business Days after such final determination, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to deliver to Parent from the
Escrow Fund an aggregate amount of cash equal to the amount of such excess
(the "Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount").

1.12 Taking of Further Action. If at any time after the First Merger Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Second Merger Surviving Entity with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, or to vest Parent with full right, title
and possession to all of the Company Capital Stock, then each of the Second
Merger Surviving Entity, Parent and the officers and directors of each of the
Second Merger Surviving Entity and Parent are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action.

OF THE COMPANY

Subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in the specific section,
subsection or sub-clause of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent on the date hereof prior to the execution and delivery hereof (the
"Disclosure Schedule") that corresponds to the specific section, subsection or
sub-clause of each representation and warranty set forth in this Article II
(provided, however, that any information set forth in



a section, subsection or sub-clause of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to be disclosed for purposes of, and shall qualify, the corresponding section,
subsection or sub-clause of this Agreement and any other section, subsection
or sub-clause of this Agreement, where it is reasonably apparent on the face
of such disclosure that such information applies to such other section,
subsection or sub-clause), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and the Merger Subs as follows:

2.1 Organization and Good Standing. The Company is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. The Company has the requisite corporate power to own, lease
and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as
currently conducted. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which
the character or location of its assets or properties (whether owned, leased
or licensed) or the nature of its business make such qualification or license
necessary to the Company's business as currently conducted, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company
has Made Available true, correct and complete copies of its certificate of
incorporation, as amended to date, and bylaws, as amended to date, each in
full force and effect on the date hereof (collectively, the "Charter
Documents"). When made, all the payments made in accordance with Section
1.6(b) and as reflected in the Payment Spreadsheet shall comply with the
Charter Documents. Since the date the Charter Documents were Made Available,
the Company Board has not approved or proposed any amendment to any of the
Charter Documents. Section 2.1 of the Disclosure Schedule lists the directors
and board appointed officers of the Company.

2.2 Authority and Enforceability.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which it is a party and, subject
to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and any Related
Agreements to which the Company is a party and the consummation of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company (including the unanimous approval of the Company
Board) and no further corporate or other action is required on the part of the
Company to authorize this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which the
Company is a party or to consummate the Transactions, other than the adoption

Company who hold (i) a majority of the outstanding shares of Voting Common
Stock and Voting Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-

(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) collectively, the "Requisite Stockholder Approval").
The Requisite Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the Stockholders
required under applicable Legal Requirements, the Charter Documents and all
Contracts to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party to legally adopt
this Agreement and approve the Transactions.

(b) The Company Board has unanimously determined that this Agreement and the
Transactions are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company
and its Stockholders, approved this Agreement and the Transactions, and
recommended to the Stockholders to vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement
and approval of the Transactions. The Company Board has taken all necessary
actions so that any restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section
203 of Delaware Law are not applicable



to this Agreement and the Transactions and no "control share acquisition,"
"fair price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover Legal Requirement (such Law,
including Section 203 of Delaware Law, "Takeover Law") applies to this
Agreement or the Transactions.

(c) This Agreement and each of the Related Agreements to which the Company is
a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto and
thereto, constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company
enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms, subject to
(x) Legal Requirements of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, the relief of debtors and enforcement of creditors'
rights in general, and (y) rules of law governing specific performance,
injunctive relief, other equitable remedies and other general principles of
equity (clauses (x) and (y) collectively, the "Enforceability Limitations").

(d) The Company and the Company Board have taken all actions necessary to
effect the transactions anticipated by Section 1.6(b)(iv) under the Plan, all
Company Options, and any other plan or arrangement of the Company (whether
written or oral, formal or informal) governing the terms of any Company
Options, including (i) the determination by the administrators of the Plan
that the treatment of Company Options contemplated by Section 1.6(b)(iv) is
permissible under the terms of the Plan and the applicable equity award
agreements, and (ii) the delivery of all required notices and the procurement
of all necessary approvals and consents from third parties necessary to
effectuate the foregoing.

(e) The Company has complied with the provisions of, and no breach, violation
or default exists under, any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party that provides for any notice or negotiation rights
with respect to an acquisition of the Company.

Order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with any
Governmental Entity, is required by, or with respect to, the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
any Related Agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or the

waivers, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
filings as may be required under applicable securities laws and state "blue
sky" laws, and (c) the filing of the First Merger Certificate of Merger and

State of Delaware.

2.4 No Conflicts. The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
and any Related Agreement to which the Company is a party, and the
consummation of the Transactions, will not conflict with or result in any
violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, modification or
acceleration of any material obligation or loss of any material benefit under,
or result in the imposition of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any
material assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of the equity
securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries under, (any such event, a
"Conflict") (a) any provision of the Charter Documents or the organizational
documents of any Subsidiary, as amended, (b) any Material Contract to which
the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective
properties or assets (whether tangible or intangible) are bound, or (c) any
Legal Requirement or Order applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary.

(a) As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of (i) 40,265,971 shares of Company Common Stock, $0.00001 par value
per share, of which (A) 39,691,471

the Company Capital Stock is held by the Persons and in the amounts set forth
in Section 2.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule which further sets forth for each
such Person the number of shares held of each series of Company Capital Stock,
class and/or series of such shares and the number of the applicable stock
certificate representing such shares. All outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and are not subject to preemptive rights created by statute, the
Charter Documents, or any agreement to which the Company is a party or by
which it is bound.

(b) All outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (including Company
Restricted Stock) and Company Options have been issued or repurchased (in the
case of shares that were outstanding and repurchased by the Company or any
Stockholder) in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, and were
issued, transferred and repurchased (in the case of shares that were
outstanding and repurchased by the Company or any Stockholder) in accordance
with any right of first refusal or similar right or limitation Known to the
Company. No Stockholder has exercised any right of redemption, if any,
provided in the Charter Documents with respect to shares of the Company
Preferred Stock, and the Company has not received notice that any Stockholder
intends to exercise such rights. The Company does not have any liability
(contingent or otherwise) or claim, loss, liability, damage, deficiency, cost
or expense relating to or arising out of the issuance or repurchase of any
Company Capital Stock, or out of any agreements or arrangement relating
thereto (including any amendment of the terms of any such agreement or
arrangement). There are no declared or accrued but unpaid dividends with
respect to any shares of Company Capital Stock. Other than the Company Capital
Stock set forth in Section 2.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company has
no other capital stock authorized, issued or outstanding.

(c) Section 2.5(c) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth for all holders of
Company Restricted Stock as of the date hereof, the name of the holder of such
Company Restricted Stock, the date of grant and/or purchase of such Company
Restricted Stock, as applicable, the purchase price of such Company Restricted
Stock, if any, the repurchase price of such Company Restricted Stock, if any,
whether such Company Restricted Stock was acquired pursuant the exercise of an
incentive stock option (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) and the vesting
schedule for such Company Restricted Stock, the extent vested to date and
whether the vesting of such Company Restricted Stock is subject to
acceleration as a result of the Transactions or any other events and whether
the holder has made a timely election with the IRS under Section 83(b) of the
Code with respect to such Company Restricted Stock.

(d) All holders of Company Restricted Stock are current employees or directors
of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Each holder of Company Restricted Stock
has made a timely election with the IRS under Section 83(b) of the Code with
respect to such Company Restricted Stock.



(e) Except for the Plan, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has ever
adopted, sponsored or maintained any stock option plan or any other plan or
agreement providing for equity or equity-related compensation to any Person
(whether payable in shares, cash or otherwise). The Company has reserved
8,077,033 shares of Company Common Stock for issuance to employees and
directors of, and consultants to, the Company upon the issuance of stock or
the exercise of options or the granting or purchase of restricted stock or the
granting of restricted stock units granted under the Plan, of which (i)
6,971,482 shares are issuable, as of the date hereof, upon the exercise of
outstanding, unexercised options granted under the Plan, (ii) 378,769 shares
have been issued upon the exercise of options granted under the Plan and
remain outstanding as of the date hereof, (iii) no shares have been issued as
restricted stock awards under the Plan and remain outstanding as of the date

Company Option was originally granted with an exercise price that the Company
Board in good faith, based on a reasonable valuation method utilized at the
time of grant, determined to be at least equal to the fair market value of a
share of Company Common Stock on the date of grant. The terms of the Plan and
the applicable agreements for each Company Option and/or Company Restricted
Stock award permit the assumption of options to purchase Parent Common Stock,
and the cashout and/or termination of Company Options or Company Restricted
Stock, as applicable, as provided in this Agreement, without the consent or
approval of the holders of such securities, the Stockholders or otherwise and
without any acceleration of the exercise schedules or vesting provisions in
effect for such Company Options or Company Restricted Stock, as applicable.
True and complete copies of all agreements and instruments relating to or
issued under the Plan have been Made Available and such agreements and
instruments have not been amended, modified or supplemented, and there are no
agreements to amend, modify or supplement such agreements or instruments from
the forms thereof Made Available. No holder of Company Options has the ability
to early exercise any Company Options for shares of Company Restricted Stock
under the Plan or any other Contract relating to such Company Options. All
Company Optionholders are current or former employees or non-employee
directors of the Company.

(f) Section 2.5(f) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth for each outstanding
Company Option and Company Warrant, the name of the holder, the type of entity
of such holder, and the country and state of residence of record of such
holder, whether such holder is an Employee, the number of shares of Company
Capital Stock issuable upon the exercise of such option or warrant (as
applicable), the date of grant, the exercise price (if any), the vesting
schedule, including the extent vested to date and whether such vesting is
subject to acceleration as a result of the Transactions or any other events,
whether such option is a nonstatutory option or intended to qualify as an
incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code and whether (and
to what extent) such Company Option is or has ever been subject to Section
409A (whether or not subsequently amended to comply with or be exempt from the
requirements of Section 409A and any action taken to amend such Company Option
to comply with or be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A).

(g) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or any
Subsidiary (i) having the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders
may vote (or which is convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having
such right) or (ii) the value of which is in any way based upon or derived
from capital or voting stock of the Company, are issued or outstanding as of
the date hereof.

(h) Except for the Company Options or Company Warrants, there are no options,
warrants, calls, rights, convertible securities, commitments or agreements of
any character, written or oral, to which the Company or any Subsidiary is or
has ever been a party or by which the Company is or has ever been bound
obligating the Company to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem, or cause
to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or obligating the Company to grant, extend,
accelerate the vesting of, change the price of, otherwise amend or enter into
any



such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. None of the
Company, the Company Board, any committee of thereof or the administrator of
the Plan has resolved to accelerate or accelerated the vesting of any Company
Restricted Stock or Company Options in contemplation of the Transactions.
There are no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock,
profit participation, or other similar rights with respect to the Company or
any Subsidiary (whether payable in shares, cash or otherwise). Except as
contemplated hereby, there are no voting trusts, proxies, or other agreements
or understandings with respect to the voting stock of the Company or any
Subsidiary, and there are no agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary
is a party relating to the registration, sale or transfer (including
agreements relating to rights of first refusal, co-sale rights or "drag-along"
rights) of any Company Capital Stock. As a result of, and immediately
following, the First Merger, Parent will be the sole record and beneficial
holder of all issued and outstanding Company Capital Stock and all rights to
acquire or receive any shares of Company Capital Stock, whether or not such
shares of Company Capital Stock are outstanding.

(i) Section 2.5(i) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the outstanding
principal, accrued interest and applicable rate of interest of all outstanding
Indebtedness from the Company (as lender) to Stockholders (as borrowers).

(j) All Company Warrants will automatically convert into Company Capital Stock
at the Closing and there will not be any Company Warrants outstanding as of
immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time.

2.6 Company Subsidiaries.

(a) Section 2.6(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists each corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, association, joint venture or other business
entity of which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, more than fifty
percent (50%) of the stock or other equity interest entitled to vote on the
election of the members of the board of directors or similar governing body
(each, a "Subsidiary"), including its form and state of organization,
ownership and states in which qualified to do business, and the names of each
of its officers and directors. Each Subsidiary is a corporation, limited
liability company or similar legal entity duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing (or in compliance with any comparable concept in the
applicable jurisdiction) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization. Each Subsidiary has the corporate power to own
its assets and properties and to carry on its business as currently conducted.
Each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed (to the extent such concepts are
applicable) to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the character or location of its assets or properties (whether owned,
leased or licensed) or the nature of its business make such qualifications or
licenses necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
would not reasonably be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. A true, correct and complete copy of each Subsidiary's charter
documents and bylaws (or similar charter documents), each as amended to date
and in full force and effect on the date hereof, has been Made Available. All
of the outstanding shares or other equity interests of each Subsidiary are
owned of record and beneficially by the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary
of the Company. All outstanding shares or other equity interests of each
Subsidiary are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
and not subject to preemptive rights created by statute, the charter documents
or bylaws of such Subsidiary, or any agreement to which such Subsidiary is a
party or by which it is bound, have been issued in compliance with all
applicable Legal Requirements, and are free of any other restriction
(including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such capital stock or other equity or voting interest) that would prevent the
operation by the First Merger Surviving Corporation and/or the Second Merger
Surviving Entity of such Subsidiary's business as presently conducted. There
are no options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any
character, written or oral, to which any Subsidiary is a party or by which any
Subsidiary is bound obligating such Subsidiary to issue, deliver,



sell, repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued, sold, repurchased or
redeemed, any shares of the capital stock or other equity interests of such
Subsidiary or obligating such Subsidiary to grant, extend, accelerate the
vesting of, change the price of, otherwise amend or enter into any such
option, warrant, call right, commitment or agreement. There are no outstanding
or authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation, or
other similar rights with respect to any of the Subsidiaries. Section 2.6(a)

finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand (such as any arrangement described in Section 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K
of the SEC)) where the purpose or effect of such arrangement is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving the Company or any Subsidiary
in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

(e) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary, nor, to the Company's Knowledge,
any director, officer, Employee, auditor, accountant consultant or
representative of the Company or any Subsidiary has received any written

its past practices, reserves adequate for the payment of all Taxes for the
period from the date of the Balance Sheet Date through the Closing Date, and
the Company will disclose the dollar amount of such reserves to Parent on or

agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract by which the Company or any
Subsidiary is bound to compensate any Employee for excise taxes paid pursuant
to Section 4999 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary currently
is, or has ever been, a party to or bound by any tax indemnity agreement, tax
sharing agreement, tax allocation agreement or similar Contract (other than a
Contract, such as a lease, the primary purpose of which does not relate to
Taxes). Section 2.10(g) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all persons who are
"disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder) as determined as of the date hereof.

in any country other than its country of incorporation or formation by virtue
of having a permanent establishment or other fixed place of business in that

that jurisdiction.

material respects with all applicable transfer pricing laws, including the

for financial services, provided by or to the Company or any Subsidiary are
arm's length prices for purposes of the relevant transfer pricing laws,
including Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 482 of the Code.

(i) Section 2.10(q)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule lists each Company Employee
Plan and Contract between the Company or any ERISA Affiliate and any Employee,
in each case, that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as such
term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) subject to Section 409A of

plan, if any, has been at all times since January 1, 2005 in operational
compliance with Section 409A and at all times since January 1, 2009 in
documentary compliance with Section 409A. No nonqualified deferred

any time after October 3, 2004. No compensation shall be includable in the
gross income of any Employee as a result of the operation of Section 409A with
respect to any Company Employee Plan or other arrangements or agreements which
is or has been in effect at any time prior to the First Merger Effective Time.
To the extent required, the Company and each Subsidiary has properly reported
and/or withheld and remitted on amounts deferred under any Company
nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A. There is no
Contract to which the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates is a party,

Company, Second Merger Surviving Entity or Subsidiary reporting obligations
under Section 409A.

(ii) No Company Option or other stock right (as defined in U.S. Treasury
Department regulation 1.409A-1(l)) (w) has an exercise price that was less

or right was granted (as determined in accordance with Section 409A of the
Code or, in the case of incentive stock options, in accordance with Section
422 of the Code), (x) has any feature for the deferral of compensation other

GAAP in the Company's audited financial statements provided to Parent.

Stock directly or indirectly received by Parent will be approximately equal to
the fair market value of the Parent Common Stock and other Merger
Consideration received by the Stockholders in exchange.



(ii) Ownership Continuity. To the Company's Knowledge, there is no plan or
intention by the Stockholders to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock received in the Transactions that
would reduce the Stockholders' ownership of Parent Common Stock to a number of
shares having a value of less than forty percent (40%) of the value of all of
the formerly outstanding Company Capital Stock. For purposes of this
representation, shares of Company Capital Stock exchanged for cash or other
property, surrendered by dissenters, or exchanged for cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be treated as outstanding
Company Capital Stock.

(iii) Company Liabilities. The liabilities of Company assumed by Parent and
the liabilities to which the transferred assets of Company are subject were
incurred by Company in the ordinary course of its business.

liabilities assumed by Parent plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which
the transferred assets are subject.

(s) Other. Other than the representations and warranties contained in Section
2.10(f) and 2.10(m), no representation or warranty contained in this Section
2.10 shall be deemed to apply directly or indirectly with respect to any
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning on or after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.10, the Company
makes no representation as to the amount of, or limitations on, any net
operating losses, Tax credit carry-forwards or other Tax attributes that the
Company or any Subsidiary may have following the Closing.

2.11 Real Property. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns any real
property, nor has the Company or any Subsidiary ever owned any real property.

Subsidiary or otherwise occupied by the Company or any Subsidiary
(collectively, the "Leased Real Property"). Section 2.11 of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of all leases, lease guaranties, subleases,

operation of its business. There are no other parties occupying, or with a
right to occupy, the Leased Real Property. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary owes brokerage commissions or finders' fees with respect to any
such Leased Real Property or would owe any such fees if any existing Lease
Agreement were renewed pursuant to any renewal options contained in such Lease
Agreements. The Company and each Subsidiary



has performed all of its obligations under any termination agreements pursuant
to which it has terminated any leases, subleases, licenses or other occupancy
agreements for real property that are no longer in effect and has no
continuing liability with respect to such terminated agreements. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the Leased Real Property is in good operating
condition and repair, free from any material structural, physical and
mechanical defects, is maintained in a manner consistent with standards
generally followed with respect to similar properties, and is structurally
sufficient and otherwise suitable for the conduct of the Company's business as
currently conducted. Neither the operation of the Company or any Subsidiary on
the Leased Real Property nor, to the Company's Knowledge, such Leased Real
Property, including the improvements thereon, violate in any material respect
any applicable building code, zoning requirement or statute relating to such
Leased Real Property or operations thereon, and any such non-violation is not
dependent on so-called non-conforming use exceptions.

title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold
interests in, all of its material tangible properties and assets, real,

any Liens, except for Permitted Liens. The material items of equipment owned

Employee Plan. There are no Actions pending or threatened or reasonably
anticipated (other than routine claims for benefits) against any Company
Employee Plan or against the assets of any Company Employee Plan. Each Company
Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the
First Merger Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without liability to
Parent, the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate (other than
ordinary administration expenses or with respect to benefits, other than
bonuses, commissions or amounts under other compensation plans, that were
previously earned, vested or accrued under Company Employee Plans prior to the
First Merger Effective Time). There are no audits, inquiries or proceedings
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by the IRS, DOL, or

At no time has the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate contributed
to or been obligated to contribute to any multiemployer plan (as defined in

participated in or contributed to any multiple employer plan or to any plan
described in Section 413 of the Code, a "funded welfare plan" within the

(h) International Employee Plans. Each International Employee Plan has been
established, maintained and administered in compliance in all material
respects with its terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all statutory or regulatory Legal Requirements that are applicable to
such International Employee Plan. Furthermore, no International Employee Plan
has unfunded liabilities, that as of the First Merger Effective Time, will not
be offset by insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by Legal
Requirement, no condition exists that would prevent the Company, any
Subsidiary or Parent from terminating or amending any International Employee
Plan at any time for any reason without liability to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary notice and
administration requirements and expenses or routine claims for benefits).

(i) No Post-Employment Obligations. No Company Employee Plan or Employee
Agreement provides, or reflects or represents any liability to provide, post-
termination or retiree or post-employment life insurance, health or other
employee welfare benefits to any person for any reason, except as may be
required by COBRA or other applicable Legal Requirements, and neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has ever represented, promised or contracted
(whether in oral or written form) to any Employee (either individually or to
Employees as a group) or any other person that such Employee(s) or other
person would be provided with life insurance, health or other employee welfare
benefits, except to the extent required by statute or other applicable Legal
Requirements. Section 2.16(i) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately: (i)
identifies each former Employee who is receiving or is scheduled to receive
(or whose spouse or other dependent is receiving or is scheduled to receive)
any post-termination or retiree compensation or benefits (whether from the
Company or otherwise) relating to such former Employee's service with the
Company, excluding any potential distributions from the Company's 401(k) plan
and/or any continuation coverage under COBRA or other applicable Legal
Requirements; and (ii) briefly describes such benefits.

(j) Effect of Mergers. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the Transactions (alone or in connection with
additional or subsequent events) or any termination of employment or service
in connection therewith will (i) result in any payment or benefit (including
severance, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any Employee,
(ii) result in any forgiveness of Indebtedness, (iii) materially increase any
payments or benefits otherwise payable or to be provided by the Company or any
Subsidiary or (iv) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such payments or benefits except as required under Section
411(d)(3) of the Code.

2.17 Employment Matters.

(a) Compliance with Employment Laws. The Company and each Subsidiary is in
compliance with all applicable foreign, federal, state and local Legal
Requirements and other agreements or arrangements with any works council,
employee representative or other labor organization or group of employees, and
its own policies and internal regulations respecting employment, employment
practices, terms and conditions of employment, worker classification, tax
withholding and reporting, social security contributions withholding,
prohibited discrimination, working time, employee representation, equal
employment, fair employment practices, meal and rest periods, immigration
status, employee safety and health, wages (including overtime wages),
compensation, and hours of work, or the equivalent under applicable Legal
Requirements, and in each case, with respect to Employees: (i) has withheld
and reported all amounts required by Legal Requirements or by Contract to be
withheld and reported with respect to wages, salaries and other payments to
Employees, (ii) is not liable for any arrears of wages, severance pay or any
Taxes or social security contributions or any penalty for failure to comply
with any of the foregoing, and (iii) is not liable for any payment to any
trust or other fund governed by or maintained by or on behalf of any
Governmental Entity, with respect to unemployment compensation benefits,
social security and other payroll taxes or other benefits or obligations for
Employees (other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of
business and consistent with past practice). There are no Actions pending, or
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated against
the Company, any Subsidiary, or any of their Employees relating to any
Employee, Employee Agreement or Company Employee Plan. There are no pending
or, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated
material Actions against Company, any Subsidiary, any Company trustee or any
trustee of any Subsidiary under any worker's compensation policy or long-term
disability policy. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is currently a party
to a conciliation agreement, consent decree or other agreement or order with
any federal, state, or local agency or Governmental Entity with respect to
employment practices. The services provided by each of the Company's, each
Subsidiary's and their ERISA Affiliates' current employees inside the United
States are terminable at the will of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates, and
outside the United States are terminable in compliance with applicable Legal
Requirements, and any such termination would result in no expenses to the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate (other than statutory severance obligations,
ordinary administration expenses, previously agreed to severance pay or
benefits, bonuses, commissions or amounts under other compensation plans, that
were previously earned, vested or accrued under Company Employee Plans prior
to the First Merger Effective Time). Section 2.17(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule lists all current amounts owed to any Employee that would result from
the termination by the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of such Employee's
employment or provision of services, other than those disclosed in Section
2.16(i). To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has direct or indirect liability with respect to any
misclassification of any person as an independent contractor, intern and/or
temporary worker rather than as an employee, with respect to any employee
leased from another employer or with respect to any employee currently or
formerly classified as exempt from overtime wages, or the equivalent under
applicable Legal Requirements.

(b) Labor. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not a party to any collective
bargaining or other agreements with any union, works council, employee
representative or other labor organization or group of employees. No strike,
labor dispute, slowdown, concerted refusal to work overtime, or work stoppage
or labor strike against the Company or any Subsidiary is pending, or to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, or reasonably anticipated. The Company
has no Knowledge of any activities or proceedings of any labor union, works
council, employee representative or other labor organization or group of
employees to organize any Employees. There are no Actions, labor disputes or
grievances pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened relating to
any labor matters involving any Employee, including charges of unfair labor
practices. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary



has engaged in any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National
Labor Relations Act or similar Legal Requirement. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is presently, nor has it been in the past, a party to, or bound by,
any collective bargaining agreement, or other agreements with any union, works
council, employee representative or other labor organization or group of
employees with respect to Employees and no such agreement is being negotiated
by the Company or any Subsidiary.

(c) Immigration Documentation. The Employees are authorized and have legally
required documentation to work in jurisdictions in which they are working.
Section 2.17(c) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete
list of (i) all U.S.-based employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who
are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents and (ii) all employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries based outside of the United States that are not
citizens or permanent residents of the jurisdiction in which they perform
services. Each of the U.S.-based employees required to be listed on Section
2.17(c) of the Disclosure Schedule is authorized under applicable U.S.
immigration Legal Requirements to work in his or her current position for the
Company or its Affiliate and each non-U.S.-based employee required to be
listed on Section 2.17(c) of the Disclosure Schedule is authorized under
applicable Legal Requirements to work in his or her current positions for the
Company or any Subsidiary.

(d) No Interference. No Employee or consultant of the Company or any
Subsidiary is obligated under any Contract or subject to any Order, in each
case, that would materially interfere with such person's efforts to carry out
his/her functions to promote the interests of the Company or any Subsidiary or
that would materially interfere with the Company's business.

2.18 Governmental Authorizations. Each notification, consent, license, permit,
grant or other authorization (a) pursuant to which the Company or any
Subsidiary currently operates or holds any interest in any of their respective
properties, or (b) which is required for the operation of the Company's or any
Subsidiary's business as currently conducted or the holding of any such
interest (collectively, "Company Authorizations") has been issued or granted
to the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be. The Company
Authorizations are in full force and effect, and no suspension or cancellation
of any such Company Authorizations is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened. The Company Authorizations constitute all Company
Authorizations required to permit the Company and the Subsidiaries to operate
or conduct their respective businesses or hold any interest in their
respective properties or assets and none of the Company Authorizations is
subject to any term, provision, condition or limitation which may adversely
change or terminate such Company Authorizations by virtue of the completion of
the Mergers. Since December 18, 2014, (i) the Company has been and is in
compliance with the terms and conditions of the Company Authorizations, and
(ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written notice
from any Governmental Entity regarding any violation by the Company or any
Subsidiary of any Company Authorizations, or any actual or threatened
revocation, cancellation or termination of any Company Authorizations.

2.19 Litigation and Orders.

(a) There is no material Action of any nature pending, or to the Knowledge of
the Company threatened, against the Company or any Subsidiary, their
respective properties and assets (tangible or intangible) or any of their
respective officers or directors (solely in their capacities as such). To the
Knowledge of the Company, there is no Action of any nature pending against any
Person who has a contractual right or a right pursuant to applicable Legal
Requirements to indemnification from the Company in respect of such Action

Effective Time.

2.20 Insurance. Section 2.20 of the Disclosure Schedule lists all insurance
policies and fidelity bonds covering the assets, business, equipment,
properties, operations, employees, officers and directors of the Company, any
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate. There is no claim by the Company or any
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate pending under any of such policies or bonds
as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed. In addition,
there is no pending claim of which its total value (inclusive of defense
expenses) would reasonably be expected to exceed the policy limits. All
premiums due and payable under all such policies and bonds have been paid, (or
if installment payments are due, will be paid if incurred prior to the Closing
Date) and the Company, any Subsidiary and its ERISA Affiliates are otherwise
in material compliance with the terms of such policies and bonds (or other
policies and bonds providing substantially similar insurance coverage). Such
policies and bonds are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has received any written threat of termination of, or premium
increase with respect to, any of such policies. None of the Company, any
Subsidiary or any controlled Affiliate of either has ever maintained,
established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any self-insurance
plan.

ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
OF PARENT AND MERGER SUBS

Subject to such exceptions as are disclosed (i) in the specific section,
subsection or sub-clause of the disclosure schedule, if any, delivered by
Parent to the Company on the date hereof prior to the execution and delivery
hereof (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") that corresponds to the specific
section, subsection or sub-clause of each representation and warranty set
forth in this Article III (provided, however, that any information set forth
in a section, subsection or sub-clause of the Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed for purposes of, and shall qualify, the corresponding
section, subsection or sub-clause of this Agreement and any other section,
subsection or sub-clause of this Agreement, where it is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure that such information applies to such other
section, subsection or sub-clause) or (ii) in the Parent SEC Documents (other
than in any "risk factor" disclosure or any other forward looking



statements set forth therein), each of Parent and the Merger Subs hereby
represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

3.1 Organization and Standing. Each of Parent and Merger Sub I is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of Delaware. Merger Sub II (a) is a limited liability company duly
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware, (b)
is a disregarded entity for federal income Tax purposes and (c) does not
intend to elect to be treated as anything other than a disregarded entity for
federal income Tax purposes as of immediately following the Closing. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II is duly qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership of its
properties makes such qualification necessary, except for where such failures
to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to delay or impair Parent's, Merger Sub I's or Merger Sub II's
abilities to consummate the Mergers. Parent owns beneficially and of record
all outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub I and all outstanding membership
interests of Merger Sub II, in each case free and clear of any Liens, and no
other Person holds any capital stock of Merger Sub I or interests of Merger
Sub II nor has any rights to acquire any interest in either Merger Sub. Each
of the Merger Subs was incorporated or formed, as applicable, solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
of the Merger Subs (i) has engaged in no business activities or operations and
(ii) has conducted its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement.

3.2 Authority and Enforceability. Each of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub
II has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and any Related Agreements to which it is a party and to consummate
the Transactions. The execution and delivery by each of Parent, Merger Sub I
and Merger Sub II of this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which it is
a party and the consummation of the Transactions have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate and other action on the part of Parent and the Merger
Subs. This Agreement and any Related Agreements to which Parent and/or Merger
Sub I or Merger Sub II is a party have been duly executed and delivered by
Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II and constitute the valid and binding
obligations of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, enforceable against
Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II in accordance with their terms, subject
to the Enforceability Limitations.

3.3 Governmental Approvals and Consents. No consent, waiver, approval, Order
or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or the Merger
Subs in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any
Related Agreements to which Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II is a party
or the consummation of the Transactions, except for (a) such consents,
waivers, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
filings as may be required under applicable securities laws and state "blue
sky" laws, in (b) the filing of the First Merger Certificate of Merger and the
Second Merger Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, (c) such consents, notices, waivers, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required
under the HSR Act and (d) such consents, waivers, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings that have been
obtained prior to the execution of this Agreement on terms that in the
aggregate would not materially impair Parent's ability to consummate the
Mergers.

3.4 No Conflicts. The execution and delivery by Parent and each of the Merger
Subs of this Agreement and any Related Agreement to which Parent or such
Merger Sub is a party, and the consummation of the Transactions, will not
result in any violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation,
modification or acceleration of any material obligation or loss of any
material benefit under (a) any provision of the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws



(or equivalent organizational documents) of Parent or such Merger Sub, as
amended or (b) any Legal Requirement or Order applicable to Parent or any of
its direct or indirect subsidiaries.

3.5 SEC Reports and Financial Statements.

(a) A true and complete copy of each quarterly report and registration
statement filed by Parent with the SEC since the initial public offering of
Parent Common Stock on January 1, 2017 and prior to the date hereof (the
"Parent SEC Documents") is available on the Web site maintained by the SEC at
http://www.sec.gov, other than portions in respect of which confidential
treatment was granted by the SEC. As of their respective filing dates, the
Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent
SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained on their filing
dates any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except to the extent corrected by a subsequently filed Parent SEC
Document.

(b) Except as set forth in any Parent SEC Document, the financial statements
of Parent, including the notes thereto, included in the Parent SEC Documents
(the "Parent Financial Statements") complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto as of their respective dates, were prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto, except in the case of pro
forma statements, or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, except as
permitted under Form 10‑Q under the Exchange Act) and fairly presented in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of Parent's operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated (subject to, in the case of unaudited statements, normal and
recurring year-end audit adjustments).

(c) Parent maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of Parent; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of Parent; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of Parent that could have a
material effect on the Parent Financial Statements. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) reasonably designed to provide reasonable
assurance that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent in
the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to Parent's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since
December 31, 2014, neither Parent nor Parent's independent registered
accountant has identified or been made aware of: (A) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting utilized by Parent; (B) any illegal act or fraud,
whether or not material, that involves Parent or its management or other
employees; or (C) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.
There are no outstanding loans made by Parent or any of its direct



or indirect subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7
under the Exchange Act) or director of Parent.

3.6 Parent Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
1,000,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, of which 205,069,595 shares were
issued and outstanding as of May 21, 2019 and 100,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, of which none are issued and outstanding as of the close of business on
the day immediately preceding the date of this Agreement. All of the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued, and are fully paid and non-assessable.

3.7 Merger Consideration.

(a) Parent has sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand to pay the cash
portion of the Merger Consideration.

(b) The Parent Common Stock to be issued by Parent as part of the Merger
Consideration has been duly authorized, and upon consummation of the First

in accordance with the terms hereof, will be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable.

(c) The Parent Common Stock to be issued by Parent as part of the Merger
Consideration will be, when issued in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

Person that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Parent
or any of its subsidiaries who is entitled to any financial advisor's,
brokerage, finder's or other similar fee or commission in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions.

3.9 Statutory Merger. To the Knowledge of Parent, there are no facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers, taken
together, from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of
the Code.

3.10 No Other Representations and Warranties. Except as expressly set forth in
Article III, none of Parent, the Merger Subs nor any of their respective
agents, employees or Representatives have made, nor are any of them making any
representation or warranty, written or oral, express or implied, in respect of

completeness of any information or documents previously provided, and any such
other representations or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed. The
Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company or any of
its agents, employees or Representatives is relying on any other
representation or warranty of Parent, the Merger Subs or any of its agents,
employees or Representatives, including regarding the accuracy or completeness
of any such other representations and warranties, whether express or implied.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent hereby acknowledges that during the
course of the due diligence investigation of Parent conducted by or on behalf
of the Company in connection with the Company's consideration of the
Transactions, Parent provided information and made statements to the Company

financial condition and other matters. The Company understands and hereby
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other Person shall
have any right to file, bring or make (and hereby expressly waives to the
fullest extent allowable under applicable Legal Requirements the right to
file, bring or make) any lawsuit or other claims against Parent or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives under this Agreement or otherwise as a result of
any inaccuracies in any such information or statements unless and solely to

representation and warranty set forth in this Article III, or (ii) the Company

misrepresentation by or on behalf of Parent or the Merger Sub when such

hereby acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other Person
shall have any right to bring (and hereby expressly waives to the fullest
extent allowable under applicable Legal Requirements the right to file, bring
or make) any lawsuit or other claims against Parent or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives under this Agreement or otherwise arising out of any
forward looking, predictive or prospective information or statements. As of
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent does not have Knowledge
(excluding, for this purpose, any duty of inquiry) of any material claims for
indemnification that it has against the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to
Section 7.2(a)(i) that relate to currently outstanding Losses; provided,
however, that (A) Parent has Knowledge of matters which could result in one or
more claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) if any
Indemnified Party pays, incurs, suffers or sustains any Losses in connection
with any such matters and (B) no representations or warranties are made by
Parent as to any claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) that

capacities as such) (each, a "Third Party") regarding (A) any acquisition of
all or any part of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (including by way of
any merger or consolidation with or involving the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries) or any acquisition, issuance, grant, sale or transfer of any of
the securities, business, properties or assets of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (other than the sale of products and services in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice or license of Intellectual
Property in connection therewith), (B) any joint venture or other strategic
investment in or involving the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (other than
a commercial or strategic relationship in the ordinary course of business),

or non-binding, with any Third Party providing for an Alternative Transaction
(including a letter of intent or exclusivity agreement) or committing the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries to do any of the actions contemplated by
the preceding clauses (i)‑(vii) above.

(c) Notice of Competing Acquisition Proposals. In the event that the Company
or any of its Representatives shall receive, prior to the First Merger
Effective Time or the termination of this



Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1, any inquiry offer, proposal or
indication of interest regarding a potential Alternative Transaction, or any
request for disclosure of information or access of the type referenced in
clause (ii) of Section 5.1(b), the Company or such Affiliate or Representative
shall immediately notify Parent thereof, which notice shall include the
identity of the Third Party making any such inquiry, offer, proposal,
indication of interest or request, and the specific terms of such inquiry,
offer, proposal, indication or request, as the case may be (including a copy
of any written material and electronic communications received from such Third
Party), and such other information related thereto as Parent may reasonably
request.

(d) Actions of Representatives. The parties hereto understand and agree that
any violation of the restrictions set forth above by any Representative of the
Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

(e) Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that the provisions of this Section 5.1 were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled
to an immediate injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of
posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of
this Section 5.1 and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in
equity.

5.2 Stockholder Approval. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall solicit written consent from the Major Stockholders in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Stockholder Written Consent") and,
concurrently therewith, deliver the information statement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit E (the "Information Statement"), in each case in accordance
with Delaware Law. The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each
executed Stockholder Written Consent upon receipt thereof from any Stockholder
pursuant to such solicitation. It is anticipated that, promptly after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company will receive Stockholder Written
Consents from Stockholders pursuant to the preceding solicitation that are
sufficient to fully and irrevocably deliver the Requisite Stockholder
Approval. Promptly upon obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the
Company shall prepare and, as soon as reasonably practicable, send to all
Stockholders on the record date for the Stockholder Written Consents who did
not execute a Stockholder Written Consent the notices required pursuant to
Delaware Law. Such materials submitted to the Stockholders in connection with
such Stockholder Written Consents shall be subject to review and comment by
Parent. Each party agrees that information supplied by such party for
inclusion in the Information Statement will not, on the date the Information
Statement is first sent or furnished to the Stockholders, contain any
statement which, at such time, is false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not false or misleading.

5.3 Reasonable Best Efforts to Close. Subject to the terms and conditions
provided in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto (other than the
Stockholder Representative) shall use reasonable best efforts to take
promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions, and to do promptly, or
cause to be done promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Legal Requirements to consummate and make effective Transactions as
promptly as practicable, including by using reasonable best efforts to take
all action necessary to satisfy all of the conditions to the obligations of
the other party or parties hereto to effect the Mergers set forth in Section
1.2(b), to obtain all necessary waivers, consents, approvals and other
documents required to be delivered hereunder and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings and to remove any injunctions or other impediments
or delays, legal or otherwise, in each case in order to consummate and make
effective the Transactions for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto
the benefits



contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto, at the request of another
party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do and
perform such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable for
effecting completely the consummation of the Transactions.

5.4 Access to Information. The Company shall afford Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during the period from the date hereof and
prior to the First Merger Effective Time to (i) all of the properties, Books
and Records and Contracts of the Company and the Subsidiaries, including all
Company IP, (ii) all other information concerning the business, properties and
personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by applicable law) of the Company
and the Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request, and (iii) all Employees
of the Company and the Subsidiaries as identified by Parent. The Company
agrees to provide to Parent and its accountants, counsel and other
Representatives copies of internal financial statements (including Tax Returns
and supporting documentation) promptly upon request. No information or
knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 or
otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify, amend or supplement any
representation or warranty set forth herein or in the Disclosure Schedule or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Mergers in
accordance with the terms and provisions hereof, restrict, impair or otherwise
affect any Indemnified Parties' right to indemnification hereunder or
otherwise prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach
of covenant.

5.5 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, registration and other similar
Taxes (including, without limitation, charges for or in connection with the
recording of any instrument or document as provided in this Agreement and any
indirect or direct Taxes (including Taxes on capital gains) imposed on the
transfer or deemed transfer of any Subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) payable in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and
the Mergers ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne and timely paid one-half by
Parent and one-half by the Stockholders. The Person(s) required by applicable
Legal Requirement to file any necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to Transfer Taxes shall file such Tax Returns and documentation
and, if required by an applicable Legal Requirement, the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, shall join in the execution of such Tax Returns and
documentation.

5.6 Treatment of 401(k) Plan. Unless instructed otherwise by Parent, effective
as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the
Company shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to include
group severance pay or benefits and any arrangement pursuant to Section 401(k)
of the Code (each, a "401(k) Plan") (unless Parent provides written notice to
the Company that such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated). The Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that any such 401(k) Plan has been terminated
pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors (or similar body) of the
Company or its ERISA Affiliates, as the case may be. The form and substance of
such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The
Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any
such Company Employee Plan as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that
termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees, then such charges and/or
fees shall be included in Third Party Expenses and shall be the responsibility
of the Company, and the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such
estimate in the Statement of Expenses.

5.7 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the First Merger Effective Time,
Parent shall, and Parent shall cause the Second Merger Surviving Entity or its
successor to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company
with respect to all rights to indemnification (including advancement of
expenses) or exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on the
personal liability of, any Person who



is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior
to the First Merger Effective Time, a director, officer, employee, fiduciary
or agent of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries under the Charter Documents
or in any indemnification agreements in effect as of the date hereof and set
forth in Section 5.7 of the Disclosure Schedule to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements (each, a "DandO Indemnified Party"
and collectively, the "DandO Indemnified Parties"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall have no obligation to maintain the existence of the
Second Merger Surviving Entity for any specified period following the First
Merger Effective Time. The Company hereby represents to Parent that no claim
for indemnification has been made as of the date hereof by any director or
officer of the Company.

(b) Prior to the First Merger Effective Time, the Company shall purchase (and
pay in full all premiums on) an extended reporting period endorsement under
the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage
for the Company's directors and officers on terms reasonably acceptable to
Parent that shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six
(6) years following the First Merger Effective Time of not less than the
existing coverage and have other terms not materially less favorable to the
insured Persons than the directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage
presently maintained by the Company and any premiums with respect to such
policy shall be Third Party Expenses hereunder. After the First Merger
Effective Time, Parent and the Second Merger Surviving Entity shall maintain
such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder; provided, however, that Parent and the Second Merger Surviving
Entity shall have no obligation to pay premiums or any other amounts with
respect to such policy. In addition, prior to the First Merger Effective Time,
the Company shall purchase (which expense shall not be a Third Party Expense)
a single premium tail coverage policy with respect to the Company's current
errors and omissions insurance policies that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the First Effective Time (the "Errors and Omissions
Insurance") for a period of sixty (60) months following the Closing Date.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this Section 5.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party to whom this Section
5.7 applies without the consent of such affected DandO Indemnified Party (it
being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this Section
5.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.7 and shall
be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

(d) In the event that, following the Second Merger Effective Time, Parent or
the Second Merger Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person or (iii) commences a dissolution, liquidation,
assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar action, then, and in each
such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that
either the successors and assigns of Parent or the Second Merger Surviving
Entity, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.7.

5.8 Tax Matters.

(a) Limitation on Return Filing for Pre-Closing Periods. Neither Parent nor
any Affiliate of Parent shall file, amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax
Return relating in whole or in part to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period which results in the Indemnifying Parties becoming liable for
additional Taxes, without consulting the Stockholder Representative and
considering in good faith the Stockholder Representative's reasonable
comments. Parent and any Affiliate of Parent shall prepare any such Tax
Returns relating in whole or in part to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period consistent with



the past practices of the Company unless otherwise required by applicable
Legal Requirements. Neither Parent nor any Affiliate of Parent shall elect to
waive any carryback of the Company's net operating losses (if any) under
Section 172(b)(3) of the Code on any Tax Return of the Company filed for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (or any similar provision of local, state or non-U.S.
Legal Requirement), to the extent that such net operating loss is attributable
to a period ending on or before the Closing Date.

(b) Transaction Related Deductions. For all purposes, including with respect
to the preparation of any Tax Returns, Parent, the Company and the Stockholder
Representative agree that (i) all Transaction Deductions shall be treated as
properly allocable to the taxable period or portion thereof ending on or
before the Closing Date and shall be included as deductions on the Tax Returns
of the Company for such period to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirement, and (ii) such Tax Returns shall be prepared for a pre-
Closing short year in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) (and not using the "next day" rule of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)). "Transaction Deductions" means
all items of loss, deduction or credit resulting from or attributable to (x)
the repayment at or prior to Closing of Indebtedness of the Company and the
payment at or prior to Closing of any related fees, expenses or interest, and
(y) Third Party Expenses. The Transaction Deductions described in clause (y)
shall be computed consistent with the safe harbor for treating success-based
fees pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2011-29, 2011-18 I.R.B. 746 in lieu of
maintaining the documentation required by Treasury Regulations Section
1.263(a)-5(f).

(c) Closing of Books for Straddle Period. In the case of any tax period that
begins prior to the Closing Date but does not end on the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income of
the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as if the Straddle Period ended as of the close
of business on the Closing Date, except that any exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis shall be calculated on a per
diem basis, and the amount of Taxes charged on a periodic basis (such as ad
valorem or property Taxes) that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period portion of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period.

(d) Past Tax Claims. If any item on a Tax Return of the Company for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, or the amount of taxable gain or loss resulting therefrom,
is disputed by any Governmental Entity as part of a tax claim (a "Past Tax
Claim"), the party receiving notice of the Past Tax Claim shall promptly
notify the other parties. The control and resolution of Past Tax Claims shall
be governed by Section 7.4(d).

(e) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent and the Stockholders shall, and the
parties shall cause the Company to, cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other parties, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include, (A) the retention and (upon another party's
request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any
such audit or litigation, (B) directing any holder, professional firm,
accountant, or other Person in possession of any records, materials, work
papers which may be relevant to Parent in respect of any audit, compliance
matter, or other reason to provide Parent direct access to, and possession of,
all such materials, work papers, records, memos, files, and the like, or (C)
making officers, accountants, or other representatives reasonably available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. The Stockholders and Parent agree, and
shall cause the Company (A) to retain all books and records with respect to
tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of limitations (and,
to the extent notified by Parent, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable



periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Entity, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the other party so requests, Parent or the Stockholders, as the case
may be, shall, and shall cause the Company to, allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records.



ARTICLE VI

PRE-CLOSING TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

6.1 Pre-Closing Termination. Except as provided in Section 6.2, this Agreement
may be terminated and the Mergers abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

(b) by Parent if the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained by the Company and delivered to Parent within four (4) hours after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and the Company;

(c) by Parent or the Company if the Closing Date shall not have occurred prior
to 11:59 PM Pacific time on June 4, 2019 (the "End Date"); provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 6.1(c) shall not
be available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal
cause of or resulted in the failure of the Mergers to occur on or before such
date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

(d) by Parent or the Company if any Legal Requirement shall be in effect which
has the effect of making the Mergers illegal or otherwise prevents
consummation of the Mergers, provided that in the case of any such Legal
Requirement that is an Order, such Order has become final and non-appealable;

(e) by Parent if there has been a breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in
this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 1.2(b)(ii)(A) and
Section 1.2(b)(ii)(B) would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or
inaccuracy and such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured within ten (10)
calendar days after written notice thereof to the Company; provided, however,
that no cure period shall be required (i) for a breach or inaccuracy which by
its nature cannot be cured or (ii) if any of the conditions to Closing in
Section 1.2(b) for the benefit of Parent are incapable of being satisfied on
or before the End Date; or

(f) by the Company if there has been a breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent set forth in this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 1.2(b)(iii)(A) and
Section 1.2(b)(iii)(B) would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or
inaccuracy and such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured within ten (10)
calendar days after written notice thereof to Parent; provided, however, that
no cure period shall be required (i) for a breach or inaccuracy which by its
nature cannot be cured or (ii) if any of the conditions to Closing in Section
1.2(b) for the benefit of the Company are incapable of being satisfied on or
before the End Date.

6.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 6.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the Merger Subs or
the Company, or their respective officers, directors or stockholders, if
applicable; provided, however, that each party hereto and each Person shall
remain liable for any willful and intentional breaches of this Agreement,
Related Agreements or in any certificate or other instruments delivered
pursuant to this Agreement prior to its termination; and provided further,
however, that, the provisions of this Section 6.2, Sections 7.5(b)
(Stockholder Representative Indemnification), 8.6



(Confidentiality), 8.7 (Public Disclosure), 8.8 (Third Party Expenses), and
Article VIII (General Provisions) shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of this
Article VI.



ARTICLE VII 
POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION

7.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Related Indemnification
Claims. The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, and the right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof
under this Agreement, shall survive until 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on the
eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the date of expiration of
such period, the "Expiration Date"); provided, however, that each Specified
Representation, and the right to make indemnification claims in respect of
such Specified Representation, shall survive until the expiration of all
applicable underlying statutes of limitations governing the subject matters
addressed by each such Specified Representation (including all periods of
extension, whether automatic or permissive and without giving effect to the
limitations of 10 Del. C. § 8106(a)); provided, further, that all
representations and warranties of the Company, and the right to make
indemnification claims in respect thereof under this Agreement, shall survive
beyond the Expiration Date or other survival periods specified above with
respect to any inaccuracy therein or breach thereof if a claim is timely made
in accordance with the terms hereunder prior to the expiration of the survival
period for such representation and warranty, in which case such representation
and warranty, and the right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof
under this Agreement, shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been
finally resolved without giving effect to the limitations of 10 Del. C. §
8106(a); provided further, that where any survival period that extends beyond
the Expiration Date would otherwise be limited by 10 Del. C. § 8106(a) the
parties intend that 10 Del. C. § 8106(c) shall apply. The representations and
warranties of Parent and the Merger Subs set forth in this Agreement, the
Related Agreements or in any certificate or other instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate at the Closing. For the avoidance
of doubt, it is the intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing
respective survival periods and termination dates supersede any applicable
statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply to such representations and
warranties and the right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof
under this Agreement.

7.2 Indemnification.

(a) From and after the consummation of the First Merger, subject to the terms
and limitations of this Article VII, the Stockholders (each, an "Indemnifying
Party" and collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties") shall severally, but not
jointly, indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its affiliates (including the
Second Merger Surviving Entity) and their respective directors, officers and
other employees, (each, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties"), from and against all losses, liabilities and damages
of any kind or nature, Taxes, awards, judgments penalties, fees, costs and
expenses, including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys' and consultants' fees
and expenses and any such reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with investigating, defending against or settling any
claims that are indemnifiable hereunder (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and
collectively "Losses") paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by the
Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Second Merger Surviving
Entity) (regardless of whether or not such Losses relate to any third party
claims), resulting from or arising out of any of the following:

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in, as of the date hereof or as of the
Closing, a representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, without giving effect to any update of or modification to the
Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on or after the date
of



this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event of any such breach or
inaccuracy, for purposes of determining the amount of any Loss relating
thereto no effect will be given to any qualifications based on the word
"material" or similar phrases (including "Company Material Adverse Effect")
contained therein (it being agreed and understood however that such
qualifications will continue to apply, as applicable, to the determination of
whether a breach or inaccuracy of representation or warranty has occurred);

(ii) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, any inaccuracy in any information required to be set forth in the
Payment Spreadsheet, including any failure to properly calculate any item
required to be contained therein or any inaccuracy in any information
underlying any such calculation;

(iii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement which is required to be
performed prior to the Closing;

(iv) any payment in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares
in accordance with this Agreement, and any other Losses paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained in respect of any Dissenting Shares, including all out-
of-pocket attorneys' and consultants' fees, costs and expenses and including
any such out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending against or settling any action or proceeding in
respect of Dissenting Shares;

(v) (A) any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary attributable to any taxable
period or portion thereof that ends on or prior to the Closing Date ("Pre-
Closing Tax Period") (it being understood that, in the case of Taxes based
upon income, sales, proceeds, profits, receipts, wages, compensation or
similar items (including for the avoidance of doubt income includible in gross
income pursuant to Section 951 or 951A of the Code), the Taxes attributable to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined on the
basis of a closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date, and the amount of any other Taxes of the Company attributable to such
Tax period shall equal the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period up to and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of
which is the total number of days in the taxable period), (B) any Taxes
attributable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
Transaction Payroll Taxes and the Stockholders' share of any Transfer Taxes as
set forth in Section 5.5, (C) any Taxes as a result of the Company or any
Subsidiary being (or ceasing to be), on or prior to the Closing Date, (1) a
member of an affiliated or combined group pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law or
(2) a transferee or successor by contract (other than a Contract, such as a
lease, the primary purpose of which is not related to Taxes or otherwise),
which relate to an event occurring on or before the Closing Date, or (D) as a
result of an express obligation arising on or prior to the Closing Date to
indemnify or otherwise assume or succeed to the Taxes of any other Person;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Parties shall not indemnify the
Indemnified Parties from and against: (1) any Taxes arising as a result of any
election made by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Second Merger
Surviving Entity) after the Closing, (2) any Taxes arising as a result of any
action taken by Parent or the Second Merger Surviving Entity on the Closing
Date after the Closing outside of the ordinary course of business, or (3)
Parent's share of any Transfer Taxes as set forth in Section 5.5;

(vi) any of the matters set forth on Schedule 7.2(a)(vi);

(vii) any Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount; and



(viii) any actual fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation by or
on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Disclosure Schedules) or the
Transactions.

(b) The Indemnifying Parties shall not have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from the Second Merger Surviving
Entity, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any Loss
claimed by and/or paid to an Indemnified Party pursuant to the indemnification
provisions hereof.

(c) Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification
obligations under this Article VII will be treated as adjustments to the
Merger Consideration for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern
for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, subject to Section
7.3(b)(iv), the indemnification rights set forth in this Article VII shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties from and after the
First Merger Effective Time for any claims arising under this Agreement,
including claims of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant in this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) this
Section 7.2(d) shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to
specific performance or injunctive relief and (ii) nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party (and this Article VII shall
not be the sole and exclusive remedy in respect of such Indemnifying Party) in
connection with a claim based on actual fraud, willful breach or intentional
misrepresentation committed by or with the actual knowledge of such
Indemnifying Party.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of any party to a Related
Agreement to pursue remedies under such Related Agreement against the other
parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein or in any Related Agreement shall give rise to any right on
the part of any Indemnified Party, after the consummation of the Transactions,
to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

7.3 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) Threshold. Except in the case of actual fraud, willful breach or
intentional misrepresentation, and for breaches of or inaccuracies in the
Specified Representations, the Indemnified Parties, as a group, may not
recover any Losses pursuant to an indemnification claim under Section
7.2(a)(i) unless and until the Indemnified Parties, as a group, shall have
paid, incurred, suffered or sustained at least $1,500,000 in Losses in the
aggregate in respect of indemnification claims under Section 7.2(a)(i) (the
"Threshold Amount"), in which case the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to recover all such Losses without regard to the Threshold Amount. For the
avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in this Section 7.3(a)(i) shall
not apply to indemnification claims under any other clause of Section 7.2(a).

(b) Maximum Liability.

(i) Except in the case of actual fraud, willful breach or intentional
misrepresentation, and indemnification claims for breaches of or inaccuracies
in the Specified Representations and the IP Representations, the Indemnified
Parties' sole and exclusive source of recovery for indemnification claims
under Section 7.2(a)(i) shall be recourse against the Escrow Amount held in
the Escrow Fund. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in this
Section 7.3(b)(i) shall not apply to any indemnification claim under clauses
(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) of Section 7.2(a).



(ii) Except in the case of actual fraud, willful breach or intentional
misrepresentation, the liability of the Indemnifying Parties for
indemnification claims for breaches of or inaccuracies in the IP
Representations shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a dollar amount equal
to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Total Consideration (net of any amounts
distributed from the Escrow Fund to the Indemnified Parties in satisfaction of
such claims).

(iii) The Indemnified Parties' first source of recovery for indemnification
claims under Section 7.2(a) shall be recourse against the Escrow Amount held
in the Escrow Fund, but if the Escrow Fund is insufficient to satisfy any
portion of a Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made under
Section 7.2(a)(i) for breaches of or inaccuracies in the Specified
Representations or IP Representations, or for which an indemnification claim
has been made under clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) or (viii) of
Section 7.2(a), the Indemnified Parties shall, subject in each case to the
limitations set forth in this Article VII, be entitled to recover such excess
portion of such Losses in respect of such indemnification claims (the portion
of any such excess Loss for which such indemnification is not satisfied by the
Escrow Fund is referred to as an "Excess Loss") directly from the Indemnifying
Parties and each Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article VII, be liable, severally and not jointly, solely for
its, his or her Pro Rata Portion of the Excess Losses in respect of such
indemnification claim.

(iv) The liability of each Indemnifying Party for indemnification claims under
this Agreement shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a dollar amount equal to
the aggregate portion of the Merger Consideration actually received by such
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement (without regard to any
withholding, vesting or other similar limitation applicable to such payments);
provided, however, that nothing in this Article VII shall limit the liability
of an Indemnifying Party in connection with a claim based on actual fraud,
willful breach or intentional misrepresentation committed by or with the
actual knowledge of such Indemnifying Party.

(c) The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement, payment of Losses or any other remedy under this Agreement
shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any
other matter. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses, or any other remedy based on
any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Other than with
respect to any claim for fraud, no Indemnified Party shall be required to show
reliance on any representation, warranty, certificate or other agreement in
order for such Indemnified Party to be entitled to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement hereunder.

(d) The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this
Article VII shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements actually
received by the Indemnified Parties in respect of such Losses or any of the
events or circumstances giving rise or otherwise related to such Losses (net
of any costs or expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance,
indemnification, contribution or reimbursement, including any increases in
insurance premiums resulting from any insurance recovery), provided, that
nothing in this Section 7.3(d) shall be construed as or give rise to an
obligation to seek any such insurance, indemnification, contribution or
reimbursement. In the event that any insurance or other recovery is made by
Parent or any Affiliate of Parent with respect to any Losses for which Parent
or any such Affiliate has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to
the net aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the



Indemnifying Parties (on a pro rata basis based on the portion of the Loss
paid by or on behalf of each Indemnifying Party in respect of which such
recovery is made).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
Indemnifying Party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Indemnified
Party for any exemplary or punitive damages, or any damages measures by a
multiple of earnings, incurred, suffered or sustained by an Indemnified Party
except to the extent such exemplary or punitive damages are paid to a third
party.

(f) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover Losses relating to any
matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent that such
Indemnified Party has recovered Losses in respect of the same such matter
under another provision of this Agreement.

7.4 Indemnification Claim Procedures.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.1, if an Indemnified
Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this Article VII, such
Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (an "Indemnification Claim
Notice") to the Stockholder Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent)
(or in the event an Indemnified Party elects to pursue such indemnification
claim directly against an Indemnifying Party, to such Indemnifying Party
directly) (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered
or sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or
sustain Losses, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items
of such Losses, the date each such item was paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related. Parent may update an Indemnification Claim Notice from time to time
to reflect any new information discovered with respect to the claim set forth
in such Indemnification Claim Notice. Following the delivery of an
Indemnification Claim Notice, Parent shall provide the Stockholder
Representative and its representatives and agents with such documents and
records of the Second Merger Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries as they may
reasonably require, and reasonable access to such personnel or representatives
of the Second Merger Surviving Entity (including but not limited to the
individuals responsible for the matters that are subject of the
Indemnification Claim Notice) as they may reasonably require, for the purposes
of investigating or resolving any disputes or responding to any matters or
inquiries raised in the Indemnification Claim Notice.

(b) In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person (other than a
party to this Agreement) of any Action with respect to which the Indemnifying
Parties may become obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Article VII (each, a "Third Party Action"), the Stockholder
Representative shall (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties) have the right to
participate in (at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties), but not to
determine, control or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Action. In the
event that the Stockholder Representative has affirmatively consented in
writing to the settlement of a Third Party Action, the Indemnifying Parties
shall have no power or authority to object to the recovery by Parent of the
amount of such settlement pursuant to this Article VII. In the event that the
Stockholder Representative does not consent to any such settlement, and the
Indemnified Parties wish to seek indemnification hereunder in respect of such
Third Party Action, then the Indemnified Parties shall make such
indemnification claims pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Article
VII. A party's settlement of a Third Party Action without the consent of the
Stockholder Representative shall not be used as evidence of the truth of the
allegations in any Third Party Action or the merits of such Third Party Action
and the existence of any Third Party Action shall not create a presumption of
any breach by a party to this Agreement of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement.



(c) If the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
shall not object in writing within the forty-five (45) day period after
receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice by delivery of a written notice of
objection containing a reasonably detailed description of the facts and
circumstances supporting an objection to the applicable indemnification claim
(an "Indemnification Claim Objection Notice"), such failure to so object shall
be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative on behalf
of the Indemnifying Parties (or the applicable Indemnifying Party) that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set
forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice. In such event and subject to
Section 7.4(i), the Escrow Agent shall promptly release from the Escrow Fund a
portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the Losses set forth in such
Indemnification Claim Notice.

(d) In the event that the Stockholder Representative shall deliver an
Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.4(c)
within forty-five (45) days after delivery of such Indemnification Claim
Notice, the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties)
and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder
Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of an
indemnification claim to be recovered from the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished
to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the
terms thereof. In such event, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to Section
7.4(i), promptly release from the Escrow Fund the portion of the Escrow Amount
set forth in such memorandum. Should the amount held in the Escrow Fund, if
any, be insufficient to satisfy in whole the amount owed to an Indemnified
Party in accordance with such memorandum and this Agreement (including the
limitations set forth in this Article VII), then each Indemnifying Party
shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the date of such memorandum,
pay to the Indemnified Party such Indemnifying Party's pro rata portion of
such shortfall as though such shortfall was an Excess Loss.

(e) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to forty-five (45) days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may demand arbitration
of the matter unless the amount of the Loss that is at issue is the subject of
a pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not
be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the
Stockholder Representative. In the event that, within thirty (30) days after
submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen
(15) days after the end of such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall each select one independent arbitrator. The
two arbitrators so selected shall select a third independent arbitrator.

(f) Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara County, California,
under the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS ("JAMS"). The
arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration
shall be paid (in the case of the Stockholder Representative, solely on behalf
of the Indemnifying Parties), including the respective expenses of each party,
the fees of each arbitrator and the administrative fee of JAMS. The arbitrator
or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and
establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while
allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the
arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to
discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators,
as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and
shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys' fees and
costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the
arbitrators or a majority of the



three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought
without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to
without substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a
majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and
amount of any claim in such Indemnification Claim Notice shall be final,
binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the
Indemnifying Parties. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by
written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award,
judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s), and the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely on, and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with, the terms of such award, judgment, decree or order as
applicable. Within thirty (30) days of a decision of the arbitrator(s)
requiring payment by Parent to the Indemnifying Parties or by the Indemnifying
Parties to Parent, such person(s) shall make the payment to such other
person(s), including any distributions out of the Escrow Fund, as applicable.
Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. The forgoing arbitration provision shall apply to
any dispute among the Indemnifying Parties or any Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Parties under this Article VII, whether relating to claims to
recover funds from the Escrow Fund or to the other indemnification obligations
set forth in this Article VII.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time from time to
time that any amounts shall be required to be disbursed from the Escrow Fund,
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly and in any event
within five (5) Business Days deliver to the Escrow Agent a memorandum setting
forth such amounts, which shall be prepared and signed by both parties and
shall set forth the portion of the Escrow Amount to be disbursed from the
Escrow Fund with appropriate wiring and disbursement instructions with respect
thereto. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and
make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.
In such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release from the Escrow Fund
the portion of the Escrow Amount set forth in such memorandum.

(h) On the second (2nd) Business Day following the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall cause the Escrow Agent to (i) retain an amount equal to (A) the
aggregate amount of any claims for indemnification asserted in good faith in
an Indemnification Claim Notice delivered in accordance with Section 7.4 prior
to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date but which are not yet
resolved plus (B) one-third of the Escrow Amount and (ii) release any
remaining Escrow Amount net of such retained amounts to the Exchange Agent for
further distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with Section 1.6(b).

(i) On the second (2nd) Business Day following the Expiration Date, Parent and
the Stockholder Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to (i) retain an
amount equal to the amount of any claims for indemnification asserted in good
faith in an Indemnification Claim Notice delivered in accordance with Section
7.4 prior to the termination of the Expiration Period but which are not yet
resolved (each such claim, an "Unresolved Claim") and (ii) release any
remaining Escrow Amount net of such Unresolved Claims to the Exchange Agent
for further distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with Section
1.6(b).

(j) The amount of the Escrow Amount retained for each Unresolved Claim shall
be released (to the extent such funds are not utilized to indemnify any
Indemnified Party for such Unresolved Claim in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement) by the Escrow Agent to the Exchange Agent in accordance with
the prior sentence up on the resolution of such Unresolved Claim in accordance
with this Article VII.



7.5 Stockholder Representative.

(a) By virtue of the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement and/or a
Stockholder Written Consent, and the adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the Mergers by the Stockholders, each of the Indemnifying Parties shall be
deemed to have agreed to appoint Shareholder Representative Services LLC as
its representative, agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder
Representative for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties for all purposes
in connection with this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto,
including to give and receive notices and communications in respect of
indemnification claims under this Agreement, to authorize payment to any
Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of any indemnification
claims hereunder by any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to any such indemnification claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, any such indemnification
claim by any Indemnified Party hereunder against any Indemnifying Party or by
any such Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified Party or any dispute
between any Indemnified Party and any such Indemnifying Party, in each case
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and to take all other actions
that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated or permitted by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency
may be changed by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty
(30) days prior written notice to Parent; provided, however, that the
Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds
interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a
resignation of the Stockholder Representative or other vacancy in the position
of Stockholder Representative, such vacancy may be filled by the holders of a
majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholder Representative. After the Closing, notices or communications to or
from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Indemnifying Parties.

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted in connection with the Stockholder Representative's services pursuant
to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, while acting in good
faith and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder
Representative shall not be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the
advice of counsel. The Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify and defend the
Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless
against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representative's
duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel retained by the Stockholder Representative and any amounts required to
be paid by the Stockholder Representative to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement ("Stockholder Representative Expenses"), in each case, as
such Stockholder Representative Expense is incurred or suffered; provided,
that in the event that any such Stockholder Representative Expense is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative
will reimburse the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified
Stockholder Representative Expense to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholder
Representative by the Indemnifying Parties, any such Stockholder
Representative Expenses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative
from (i) the Representative Expense Amount and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow
Fund at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributed to the
Indemnifying Parties. The Representative Expense Amount shall be available to
pay directly, or reimburse the Stockholder Representative for, any Stockholder
Representative Expenses. Following the Expiration Date, the Stockholder
Representative shall have the right to recover Stockholder Representative
Expenses not previously recovered from the Representative Fund from the



Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to the Indemnifying Parties (provided
that such funds would otherwise be released to the Indemnifying Parties and
are no longer subject to any pending indemnification claims), and prior to any
such distribution, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting
forth the Stockholder Representative Expenses actually incurred and not
previously recovered. For the avoidance of doubt, while this section allows
the Stockholder Representative to be paid from the Representative Fund and the
Escrow Fund, this Section 7.5(b) shall not limit the obligation of any
Indemnifying Party to promptly pay such Stockholder Representative Expenses as
they are incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Stockholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties or otherwise. The Indemnifying Parties acknowledge
and agree that the foregoing indemnities in this Section 7.5(b) will survive
the resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or the
termination of this Agreement (notwithstanding Section 6.2). Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on
liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the
recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Indemnifying Parties
set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the
indemnities provided to the Stockholder Representative under this section.
Following the Expiration Date, the resolution of all indemnification claims
made under this Agreement and the satisfaction of all such indemnification
claims, the Stockholder Representative shall distribute such portion of the
Representative Expense Amount that has not been used to reimburse the
Stockholder Representative for Stockholder Representative Expenses, if any, to
the Escrow Agent, who will promptly distribute such funds to the Indemnifying
Parties in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions. A decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative, including an
amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2 or
Section 8.3, shall constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall
be final, conclusive and binding upon the Indemnifying Parties; and the Escrow
Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent and Parent are
hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative.

(c) Notwithstanding that the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
represented by Foley and Lardner LLP (the "Firm") in the preparation,
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the Related Agreements
(collectively, the "Transaction Agreements"), each of Parent and the Company
agrees that after the Closing the Firm may represent the Stockholder
Representative, the Indemnifying Parties and/or their Affiliates in all
matters related to the Transaction Agreements, including without limitation in
respect of any indemnification claims pursuant to the Transaction Agreements.
Each of Parent and the Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, that it has had an opportunity to ask for and has obtained
information relevant to such representation, including disclosure of the
reasonably foreseeable adverse consequences of such representation, and it
hereby waives any conflict arising out of such future representation.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, that the Firm has represented the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements. Such parties agree that any attorney-client privilege
and attorney work-product protection belonging to the Company and related to
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and all
information and documents to the extent covered by such privilege or
protection shall, after the Closing, belong to, be deemed the right of, and be
controlled solely by the Indemnifying Parties and may only be waived by the
Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties. To the
extent that Parent or the Company receives or takes physical possession of any
privileged or protected material covered by this Section 7.5(d) after the
Closing, such physical possession



or receipt shall not, in any way, be deemed a waiver by the Indemnifying
Parties of the privileges or protections described in this Section 7.5.

8.2 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative (and, prior to the First Merger Effective Time, the Company) at

deemed to have agreed that any extension or waiver signed by the Company shall
be binding upon and effective against all Stockholders whether or not they
have signed such extension or waiver.

proceeding under or in connection with this Agreement brought before the
foregoing courts on the basis of (i) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason, or that

hereto is entitled pursuant to any final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction.

WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
