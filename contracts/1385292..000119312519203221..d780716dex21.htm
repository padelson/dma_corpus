identically to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that all references in the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub (i) to its name, date of
incorporation, registered office and registered agent shall instead refer to
the name, date of incorporation, registered office and registered
agent, respectively, of the Company as provided in the Charter immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) naming the incorporator(s), the initial
board of directors, or original subscribers for shares of Merger Sub shall be
omitted) and such amended and restated certificate of incorporation will
become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until,
subject to the provisions of _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, thereafter amended
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and such certificate
of incorporation.

(b) _Bylaws_. The Parties shall take all necessary action such that the

provisions of _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, thereafter amended in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

 

2.6 _Directors and Officers_.

of the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified.

(b) _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective

2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any of the following securities, the following will occur:

 

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon each certificate
representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will
thereafter represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation;

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting
Company Shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive cash
in an amount equal to $19.85, without interest thereon (the "Per
Share Price"), and shall no longer be outstanding as set forth in _S_
_ection_ __ _ 2.11_; and

 



-15- 

    

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as
treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Owned Company Shares")
will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor.

(b) _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with
respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Company Stockholder who
shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in
writing and who shall have properly and validly exercised their statutory
rights of appraisal in respect of such share of Company Common Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Company Shares") will
not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share
Price pursuant to this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.7_, but instead shall entitle the
holder thereof only to such rights as may be granted to a holder of Dissenting
Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that any Dissenting Company Share held by any Company Stockholder who shall
have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his,
her or its rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Share pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon (x) be deemed no longer to be a
Dissenting Company Share and (y) be treated as if it had been converted into,
and become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive
the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of
Company Common Stock in the manner provided in _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.10_.

 

(ii) The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect
of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company may not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal
or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares. For purposes of this _S_ _ection_ __ _
2.7(c)(ii)_, "participate" means that Parent will be kept reasonably apprised
of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to demands
for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares (to
the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its
counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer
comments or suggestions with respect to such demands but will not be afforded
any decision-making power or other authority over such demands except for the
payment, settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

 

2.8 _Equity Awards_.

(a)  _Vested Company Options._ Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the
Parties or the Parent and the applicable Company Option holders, at the
Effective Time, each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, and
outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share
Price over (B) the per-share exercise price for such Company Option,
_multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company Option, without interest (the "Company
Option Consideration").

 



-16- 

    

(b) _Unvested Company Options._ Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the
Parties or the Parent and the applicable Company Option holders, at the
Effective Time, each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and will not by its
terms vest as of the Effective Time, shall be assumed and substituted without
any action on the part of the holder thereof (the "Substituted Options"), and
subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the Substituted Options
shall remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, all vesting, exercise and forfeiture terms and accelerated
vesting on specific terminations of employment, to the extent applicable, and
any new terms required to become effective as a result of such assumption
and/or substitution under the Company Option award agreement and/or Company
Equity Plan), except (i) for changes to certain terms and conditions rendered
inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
for such other administrative or ministerial changes that are not detrimental
in any material respect to the holder thereof and that in the reasonable and
good faith determination of Parent are necessary to conform the administration
of the Substituted Options and the Surviving Corporation and (ii) that upon
vesting of any Substituted Options, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
the amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the excess,
if any, of (x) the Per Share Price over (y) the per-share exercise price for
such Company Option, _multiplied by_  (B) the total number of Company Shares
underlying such Company Option that would have become vested pursuant to its
terms, without interest (the "Substituted Option Consideration").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the
per-share exercise price of any Company Option is equal to or greater than the
Per Share Price, such Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash
payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof and shall have
no further force or effect.

(c) _Unvested Company RSAs._ Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties
or the Parent and the applicable Company RSA holders, at the Effective Time,
each Company RSA that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that will not by its terms vest as of the Effective Time, shall be
assumed and substituted without any action on the part of the holder thereof
(the "Substituted RSAs"), and the Substituted RSAs shall remain subject to the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company
RSA immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
all vesting, settlement and forfeiture terms and accelerated vesting on
specific terminations of employment, to the extent applicable, and any new
terms required to become effective as a result of such assumption and/or
substitution under the Company RSA award agreement and/or Company Equity
Plan), except (A) for changes to certain terms and conditions rendered
inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
for such other administrative or ministerial changes that are not detrimental
in any material respect to the holder thereof and that in the reasonable and
good faith determination of Parent are necessary to conform the
administration of the Substituted RSAs and the Surviving Corporation and (B)
that upon vesting of any Substituted RSAs, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to the amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i)
the total number of Company Shares underlying such Company RSA that would
have become vested pursuant to its terms, multiplied by (ii) the Per Share
Price (the "Substituted RSA Consideration"), payable at the same time as such
Company RSAs for which Substituted RSAs were assumed and substituted would
have been settled pursuant to its terms.

(d) _Vested Company RSUs. _ Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties
or the Parent and the applicable Company RSU holders, at the Effective Time,
each Company RSU that is outstanding and vested by its terms immediately prior
to the Effective Time (taking into account any accelerated vesting thereof as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), shall be
canceled and converted into the right of the holder of such Company RSU to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the
total number of Company Shares underlying such Company RSU, _multiplied by_
(ii) the Per Share Price (the "Company RSU Consideration").

 

(e) _Unvested Company RSUs._ Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties
or the Parent and the applicable Company RSU holders, at the Effective Time,
each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that will not by its terms vest as of the Effective Time, shall be assumed
and substituted without any action on the part of the holder thereof
(the "Substituted RSUs"), and subject to

 



-17- 

    

 compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the Substituted RSUs shall remain
subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
all vesting, settlement and forfeiture terms and accelerated vesting on
specific terminations of employment, to the extent applicable, and any new
terms required to become effective as a result of such assumption and/or
substitution under the Company RSU award agreement and/or Company Equity
Plan), except (A) for changes to certain terms and conditions rendered
inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
for such other administrative or ministerial changes that are not detrimental
in any material respect to the holder thereof and that in the reasonable and
good faith determination of Parent are necessary to conform the administration
of the Substituted RSUs and the Surviving Corporation and (B) that upon
vesting and settlement of any Substituted RSUs, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to the amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i)
the total number of Company Shares underlying such Company RSU that would
have become vested pursuant to its terms, multiplied by (ii) the Per Share
Price (the "Substituted RSU Consideration"), payable at the same time as such
Company RSUs for which Substituted RSUs were assumed and substituted would
have been settled pursuant to its terms.

(f) _Company PSUs_. __ Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties or the
Parent and the applicable Company PSU holders, at the Effective Time, each
Company PSU that is outstanding and vested by its terms immediately prior to
the Effective Time (taking into account any accelerated vesting thereof as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), shall be canceled
and converted into the right of the holder of such Company PSU to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Company Shares underlying such Company PSU, multiplied by (ii) the
Per Share Price (the "Company PSU Consideration"). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, each Company PSU that will not by
its terms vest at or prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled without
any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof and
shall have no further force or effect.

 

(g) _Payment Procedures._ Parent and Merger Sub will ensure that the Surviving
Corporation has an amount in cash, or immediately available borrowing
capacity, sufficient to pay the Company Option Consideration, Company RSU
Consideration, and Company PSU Consideration. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days following
the Closing Date, the applicable holders of Company PSUs, Company Options, and
Company RSUs, will receive payment from the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, through its payroll system or payroll provider of all amounts
required to be paid to such holders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.8(d)_, and _Section_ __ _ 2.8(f)_, as applicable, net of
any required withholding of Taxes; _provided_ , that if any payment owed to a
holder of Company PSUs, Company Options, or Company RSUs pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.8(a),_ _Section_ __ _ 2.8(d)_, or _Section_ __ _ 2.8(f)_, as
applicable, cannot be made through the Companys or the Surviving
Corporations payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving
Corporation will, (i) by wire transfer or direct deposit, or (ii) by a check
sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the Closing Date
(but in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), provide such
payment owed to such holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any
such amounts relate to a Company PSU, Company Option, or Company RSU that is
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts at the earliest time permitted
under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement relating to
such Company PSU, Company Option, or Company RSU that will not trigger a tax
or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 

2.9 _Further Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the
Company Board will take all action necessary to effect the treatment of the
Company Stock-Based Awards pursuant to Section 2.8 (including the satisfaction
of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act).
Except as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties as provided in _S_
_ection_ __ _ 2.8_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take
all actions necessary so that all Company Stock-Based Awards and all Company
Equity Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time and so that the
provisions in any other Employee Plan or Contract providing for the issuance
or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company
Group will be cancelled as of the Effective Time. _ _ The Company will use
its reasonable best efforts to ensure that following the Effective

 



-18- 

    

 Time no participant in any Company Equity Plan or other Employee Plan will
have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

2.10 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Company Stockholders to
receive the Per Share Price to which they have become entitled pursuant to _S_
_ection_ __ _ 2.7_ (the "Payment Agent"); and (ii) enter into a payment
agent agreement, in customary form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with such Payment Agent.

 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or substantially contemporaneous with the Closing,
Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to, the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.7_, an amount of
cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company
Common Stock become entitled pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.7_. Until
disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
cash will be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United
States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii)
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; or (iii)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available)
and, in any case of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), no such
instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months (such cash and
any proceeds thereon, the "Exchange Fund"). To the extent that (A) there are
any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B)
the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by _S_ _ection_ __
_ 2.7_; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for
Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash
amounts contemplated by _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.7_ for any reason, Parent will,
or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the
amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is
at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level
sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by  _S_
_ection_ __ _ 2.7_. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be
payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, and in any
event not more than five (5) Business Days thereafter, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting
Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the "Certificates"); and (ii)
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock that represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and
Owned Company Shares) (the "Uncertificated Shares") (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and reasonably acceptable to the Company (which
will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price
payable in respect thereof pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.7_. Upon surrender
of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to
receive, and the Payment Agent shall promptly pay, in exchange therefor, an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate; by
(y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in
respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be
cancelled. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry 

 



-19- 

    

 transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares
will be entitled to receive, and the Payment Agent shall promptly pay, in
exchange therefor, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per
Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect
thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be
cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred
Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid
or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.10(c)_. Until
so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to
receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.7_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be
required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.7_.

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will
cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository
Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that the Payment Agent will transmit
to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an
amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares
and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the Per Share
Price.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered or transferred in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered or
transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company only if, in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by
a Certificate, such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for surrender and transfer or, in the case of Uncertificated Shares, a
proper transfer instruction is presented, and, in the case of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, the
Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share
Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares, or
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated
by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not
payable.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective
Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their
Certificates (or otherwise complied with _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.12_ in the case
of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates) or Uncertificated Shares
representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this
_S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.10_ will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share
Price payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock solely to
Parent (which shall remain responsible for payment of the Per Share Price in
respect thereof, subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws),
solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to
which such holders may be entitled pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.7_. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders two (2) years after the Effective
Time, or at such earlier time as is 

 



-20- 

    

 immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their
successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.

 

2.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be converted or cancelled and retired, as
applicable in accordance with _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.7_, and cease to exist; and
(b) holders of each Certificate or Uncertificated Share theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable
therefor in accordance with  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.7_, or in the case of
Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.7(c)_.
The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this  _Article_ __ _
II_ will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on
the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement
procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with
the exchange procedures of  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.10(c)_) be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article_ __ _ II_.

 

2.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will pay to such Person the Per Share
Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificates pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 2.7_. Parent or the Payment
Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of
such Per Share Price, require the Person claiming such Certificates to be

(to the extent that the concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case
of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete

limitations, matters, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the
Per Share Price to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its
Affiliates) of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is
fair from a financial point of view to such holders (it being understood and
agreed that such written opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board and

the Company Board has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on
business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other
similar applicable "anti-takeover" law will not be applicable to the Merger or

4.11 _Financing_.

(a)  _Commitment Letters_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of (i) the executed
Equity Commitment Letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, pursuant to
which the Guarantor has committed, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, to invest in Parent, directly or indirectly, the cash amounts set
forth therein for the purpose of funding a portion of the Required Amounts
(such financing, the "Equity Financing"), (ii) the executed Debt Commitment
Letter (the "Debt Commitment Letter" and together with the Equity Commitment
Letter, the "Commitment Letters"), dated as of the date of this
Agreement, pursuant to which the Financing Sources party thereto have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts
set forth therein for the purposes set forth therein (such financing, the
"Debt Financing" and together with the Equity Financing, the "Financing") and
(iii) the fee letter related to the Debt Financing (the "Fee Letter") (which
Fee Letter may be redacted in a customary manner as required by the Financing
Sources, so long as such redacted information does not adversely affect the
amount, availability, or conditionality of the funding of the Debt Financing).
The Equity Commitment Letter provides that (A) the Company is an express
third party beneficiary thereof in connection with the Companys exercise of
its rights under _S_ _ection_ __ _ 9.8(b)_; and (B) subject in all respects
to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 9.8(b)_, Parent and the Guarantor will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in
connection with the exercise of such third party beneficiary rights.

 

(b) _No Amendments_. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Commitment
Letters have not been amended or modified prior to the date of this
Agreement; (ii) no such amendment or modification is contemplated (other than
any such amendment or modification to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who have not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof); and (iii) the respective
commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated,
rescinded, amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. As of the date of
this Agreement there are no other written Contracts, agreements, side letters
or arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party relating to the
funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters. Other than as
set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent related
to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing.

 

(c) _Sufficiency of Financing_. Assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions precedent set forth in _Article VII_ , the net proceeds of the
Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters, together
with available cash of the Company Group at Closing and, solely with respect
to amounts required by _Section_ __ _ 2.8_, immediately available borrowing
capacity, will be, in the aggregate, sufficient to (i) make the payment of all
amounts payable at the Closing pursuant to _Article_ __ _ II_ in connection
with or as a result of the Merger (including the aggregate amount of the
Company Option Consideration, Company RSU Consideration, and Company PSU
Consideration payable promptly following the Closing as required by _S_
_ection_ __ _ 2.8(g)_), (ii) repay, prepay or discharge (after giving effect
to the Merger) the principal of and interest on all outstanding Indebtedness
in respect of the Credit Facility, and (iii) pay all fees and expenses
required to be paid at the Closing by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with
the Merger and the Financing (clauses (i) through (iii), collectively, the
"Required Amounts").

(d)  _Validity_. As of the date of this Agreement, each Commitment Letter (in
the form delivered by Parent to the Company) is in full force and effect and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Guarantor, as applicable, and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto,

 



-38- 

    

 enforceable against Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantor and to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Enforceability Limitations. Other than as expressly set forth
in the Equity Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full proceeds of the Equity
Financing pursuant to any agreement relating to the Equity Financing to which
the Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates, is
a party. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would, or would reasonably be expected
to, (i) constitute a default or breach of the Commitment Letters on the part
of Parent or to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto; (ii)
constitute or result in a failure to satisfy any of the terms or conditions to
receipt of the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letters; or (iii)
otherwise result in any portion of the Financing not being available (it being
understood that Parent and Merger Sub are not making any representation or
warranty regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties in _Article_ __ _ III_ or the Companys compliance hereunder). As
of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that (A) it
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to receipt
of the Financing to be satisfied by it: or (B) the full amount of the
Financing committed pursuant to the Commitment Letters will not be available
as of the Closing if the terms or conditions contained in the Commitment
Letters to be satisfied by it are satisfied (it being understood that Parent
and Merger Sub are not making any representation or warranty regarding the
effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in  _Article_
__ _ III_ or the Companys compliance hereunder). As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid,
all commitment or other fees that are due and payable on or prior to the date
of this Agreement, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
of the Commitment Letters.

(e) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
the Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates has
entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (i) awarding any
agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory
role on an exclusive basis in connection with the Merger; or (ii) expressly
prohibiting any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt
financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or financial
advisory services to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to
the Company Group in connection with the Merger.

 

4.12 _Stockholder and Management Arrangements_. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective
Affiliates is a party to any Contract with any stockholder (other than any
existing limited partner of the Guarantor or any of its Affiliates), director,
officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company Group (a) relating to (i)
this Agreement or the Transactions; or (ii) the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to continuing
employment) from and after the Effective Time; or (b) pursuant to which
any (i) such holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled to receive
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per Share Price in
respect of such holders shares of Company Common Stock; (ii) such holder of
Company Common Stock has agreed to approve this Agreement or vote against any
Superior Proposal; or (iii) such stockholder, director, officer, employee or
other Affiliate of the Company other than the Guarantor have agreed to
provide, directly or indirectly, equity investment to Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company to finance any portion of the Merger.

4.13 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor is entering into
this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. As of
the Effective Time and immediately after giving effect to the Transactions
(including the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to _Article_ __ _ II_
in connection with or as a result of the Merger and all related fees and
expenses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries
in connection therewith), (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will exceed
(i) the value of all liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and such
Subsidiaries, including contingent and other liabilities; and (ii) the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of each of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries on their existing debts (including
contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; (b) each
of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged; and (c) each of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent

 



-39- 

    

 and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of the foregoing, "not
have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay
its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature"
means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations,
asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.

4.14 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no
representation is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to any other
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement.

 

4.15 _Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties_.

 

(a) _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub,
on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that,

any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives as having been
authorized by the Company Group or any of its Affiliates or Representatives

are in lieu of and are exclusive of all other representations and warranties,

looking statements).

Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations

the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to
knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal or inquiry that
constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected

the six (6) month

 



-44- 

    

 period immediately preceding the No-Shop Period Start Date and terminate all
access granted to any such Person and its Representatives to any physical

effect of prohibiting or purports to prohibit making a confidential
Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board (or any committee thereof).

 

(c) _Conduct Following No-Shop Period Start Date_ _._ Notwithstanding anything
set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time following the
No-Shop Period Start Date but prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives receives an Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from any material breach of this _S_ _ection_ __
_ 5.3_, (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact the Person or
group of Persons making the Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms
and conditions thereof or to request that any Acquisition Proposal made orally
be made in writing; and (ii) if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, then the Company and the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their
Representatives (including the Advisor), (A) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making the
Acquisition Proposal and its or their Representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal and (B) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal

any event within 24 hours) provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company Group that is provided to any such Person
or group of Persons or its or their Representatives that was not previously
provided to Parent.

 

(d) _No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative

adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an
Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after Parent so requests in
writing, which request is transmitted after any public disclosure of an
Acquisition Proposal (provided that the

 



-45- 

    

 Company will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than two
separate occasions); (D) take or fail to take any formal action or make or
fail to make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a
tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a
"stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being
understood that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from
taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of
business on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the commencement of a tender
or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such
action being considered a violation of this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 5.3_); or (E)
fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any
action described in clauses (A) through (E), a "Company Board Recommendation
Change");  _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of
(1) the determination by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; or (2) the delivery by
the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by _S_ _ection_ __ _
5.3(e)_ will constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change; or

 

(ii) cause or permit the Company Group to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.

 

(e) _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval:

(i) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to any material event, development,
discovery, change or circumstance with respect to the Company that (A) was not
known to, or reasonably expected by, the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement; and (B) does not relate to (a) any Acquisition Proposal; or (b) the
mere fact, in and of itself, that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or
published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue,
earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending on or
after the date of this Agreement, or changes after the date of this Agreement
in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock or the
credit rating of the Company (an "Intervening Event") (it being understood
that the foregoing clause (b) will not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that any event, development, discovery, change or
circumstance underlying such fact or changes referred to in clause (b) has
resulted in or contributed to an Intervening Event), if the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and if and only if:

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5)
Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has (A) so determined; and (B) intends to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 5.3(e)(i)_,
which notice will specify the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable
detail; and

 

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
and its Representatives, during such five (5) Business Day period, must have
(A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the
extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) would no longer determine that the failure to make a
Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable law; and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives an
opportunity to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this
Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent
requests to make such a presentation); or

 

(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, whether
during the Go-Shop Period or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, that the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in

 



-46- 

    

 good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal and which did not result from any
breach of this  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 5.3_, then the Company Board may (A)
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal, in each case if and only if:

(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
pursuant to applicable law;

 

(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations
pursuant to this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 5.3_ with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal;

(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least
five (5) Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period"), which notice shall
state (A) that the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
has not been withdrawn and that the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal; (B) to the extent not
previously provided to Parent pursuant to  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 5.3(f)_, the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person or
group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal and copies of all material
documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (C) that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _S_
_ection_ __ _ 5.3(e)(ii)_ absent revisions to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination; and (ii) prior to effecting such Company
Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its
Representatives, during the Notice Period, must have (1) negotiated with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute
a Superior Proposal; and (2) permitted Parent and its Representatives an
opportunity to make a presentation to the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto
(to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in the event of any revisions to the financial terms or any
other material term or condition of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with
the requirements of this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 5.3(e)(ii)(3)_ with respect to
such new written notice (except that the Notice Period in respect of such new
written notice shall be three (3) Business Day and the Company will not be
required to permit Parent and its Representatives an opportunity to make a
presentation as contemplated by clause (ii)(2) above); and

(4) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or
permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will have validly terminated
this Agreement in accordance with _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.1(h)_, including paying
(or causing to be paid) the Company Termination Fee in accordance with _S_
_ection_ __ _ 8.3(b)(iii)_.

(f) _Notice_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VIII_ and the
Effective Time, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours
thereafter) notify Parent in writing of (i) the receipt by the Company or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, its Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal;
(ii) the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal; (iii) a copy of any such Acquisition Proposal made in writing and
any other written terms and proposals provided (including financing
commitments) to the Company or its Representatives; and (iv) a written summary
of material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal not made in
writing. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
reasonably prompt basis, of the status and supplementally provide any change
to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposals (including as required
by clauses (i) through (iv) above and any amendments thereto) and the status
of any such discussions or negotiations.

 



-47- 

    

(g) _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company
or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing
to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, including a "stop, look and listen" communication by
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication); (ii) complying with Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (iii) informing any Person

the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company
Group) that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined to make
in good faith in order to comply with applicable law, regulation or stock
exchange rule or listing agreement, it being understood that any such
statement or disclosure made by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
pursuant to this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 5.3(g)_ must be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) and
the rights of Parent under this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 5.3_, it being understood
that nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change other than in accordance with _S_ _ection_ __ _
5.3(e)_. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the Company or the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) that describes the Companys receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and the operation of
this Agreement with respect thereto will not be deemed to be (A) a
withholding, withdrawal, amendment, or modification, or proposal by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend or
modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (B) an adoption, approval or
recommendation with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (C) a Company
Board Recommendation Change. 

(h) _Breach by Representatives_. The Company agrees that any material breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ by any of its Representatives, to the extent
acting at the Companys direction, that, if taken by the Company, would be a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, will be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_ by the Company.

-48- 

    

(iv) executing and delivering any Contracts and other instruments that are
reasonably necessary to consummate the Transactions.

(b) _No Failure to Take Necessary Action_. In addition to the foregoing,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including subject to
clause (D) of the second sentence of _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.2(a)_), neither
Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand,
will take any action, or fail to take any action, that is intended to or has
(or would reasonably be expected to have) the effect of (i) preventing,
impairing, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the
Transactions; or (ii) the ability of such Party to fully perform its

6.2 _Antitrust Filings_.

 

(a) _F_ _iling Under the HSR Act and Other Applicable Antitrust Laws_. Each of

Affiliates to, to the extent required in the reasonable judgment of counsel to
Parent and the Company, (i) file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of
the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the
Transactions as required by the HSR Act within ten (10) Business Days
following the date of this Agreement; and (ii) promptly file comparable pre-
merger or post-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any
Governmental Authority (including the European Union) pursuant to other
applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with the Transactions, with Parent
having primary responsibility for the making of such filings. Each of Parent
and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to (A) cooperate and
coordinate (and cause its respective Affiliates to cooperate and coordinate)
with the other in the making of such filings; (B) supply the other (or cause
the other to be supplied) with any information that may be required in order
to make such filings; (C) supply (or cause the other to be supplied) any
additional information that may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ

applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust
Laws applicable to the Transactions; and (E) obtain (or cause to be obtained)

thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material

the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Transactions, then
such Party will make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. The parties to this Agreement shall not,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, take any action with the
intention to, or that would reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the
expiration or termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act or the
obtaining of approval of the FTC and DOJ as necessary.

(b) _Divestitures_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if

to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Transactions,
each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective

hold separate order, settlement, undertaking, stipulation or otherwise, (A)
the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all of the
capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or
intangible), rights, products or businesses of Parent and Merger Sub (and
their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company
Group, on the other hand; (B) the termination, amendment or assignment of
existing relationships or contractual rights or obligation of Parent and
Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand,
and the Company Group,

 



-49- 

    

 on the other hand; (C) the change or modification of any course of conduct
regarding future operations of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective
Affiliates), on the one hand, and the Company Group, on the other hand; and
(D) any other restrictions on the activities of Parent and Merger Sub (and
their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company
Group, on the other hand, with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or
more of their respective businesses, assets or rights or interests therein
(each of the actions in the foregoing clauses (A) through (D), a "Regulatory
Condition"); and (ii) contest, defend and appeal any Legal Proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, brought or threatened to be brought by any
Person (including any Governmental Authority) in order to avoid entry of, or
to have vacated, lifted or terminated, any order of any kind or nature that
would prevent the consummation of the Transactions from occurring prior to the
Termination Date. Except as expressly provided for under this _S_ _ection_ __
_ 6.2_, all such efforts shall be unconditional and shall not be qualified
in any manner and no actions taken pursuant to this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.2_
shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a Company Material
Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur. If any
Regulatory Condition agreed to by Parent requires action by or with respect to
the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets, and such
action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, Parent hereby consents to
the taking of such action by the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent
required by such Regulatory Condition. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be obligated
pursuant to this Agreement to, and the Company will not without the written
consent of Parent, sell, divest, license or hold separate any capital stock or
other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible),
rights, products or businesses, or to take or commit to take any action,
unless the consummation or such transaction or effectiveness of such action is
conditioned upon the Closing.

 

(c) _Cooperation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) and Parent and Merger Sub
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to), subject to any
restrictions under applicable laws, (i) promptly notify the other parties
hereto of, and, if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in
the case of oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any
material communication received by such Person from a Governmental Authority
in connection with the Transactions and permit the other parties to review and
discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the
other parties in relation to) any proposed draft notifications, formal
notifications, filing, submission or other written communication (and any
analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations, correspondence or other
documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the Transactions to a
Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably informed with
respect to the status of any such submissions and filings to any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions and any developments, meetings
or discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect thereof, including
with respect to (A) the receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent,
approval or waiver, (B) the expiration of any waiting period, (C) the
commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any investigation,
litigation or administrative or judicial action or proceeding under
applicable laws and (D) the nature and status of any objections raised or
proposed or threatened to be raised by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the Transactions; and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting,
hearing, proceeding or discussions (whether in person, by telephone or
otherwise) with or before any Governmental Authority in respect of the
Transactions without giving the other parties reasonable prior notice of such
meeting or discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority,
the opportunity to attend or participate. However, each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub may designate any non-public information provided to any
Governmental Authority as restricted to "outside counsel" only and any such
information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or their
equivalents of the other party without approval of the party providing the
non-public information; _provided, however_ , that each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub may redact any valuation and related information before
sharing any information provided to any Governmental Authority with another
Party on an "outside counsel" only basis.

 

6.3 _Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings_.

 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. Promptly following the date of this Agreement (and in
any event by August 26, 2019, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent
and the Company), the Company will prepare and file with

 



-50- 

    

 the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the
"Proxy Statement") relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to 
_S_ _ection_ __ _ 5.3_, the Company must include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

(b)  _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines that it is
required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in
connection with the Transactions pursuant to applicable law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an "Other Required Company Filing"), then the
Company will promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with
the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules of the SEC and NASDAQ. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or
any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without first providing Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and
the Company will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel. On the date of filing,
the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the
time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement nor any
Other Required Company Filing will contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with
respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied by Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing will
not, at the time that the Proxy Statement or such Other Required Company
Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

(c) _Other Required Parent Filing_. If Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates determines that it is required to file any document
with the SEC in connection with the Transactions or the Company Stockholder
Meeting pursuant to applicable law (an "Other Required Parent Filing"), then
Parent and Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to,
promptly prepare and file such Other Required Parent Filing with the SEC.
Parent and Merger Sub will cause, and will cause their respective Affiliates
to cause, any Other Required Parent Filing to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules of the SEC. Neither Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective
Affiliates may file any Other Required Parent Filing (or any
amendment thereto) with the SEC without first providing the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and Parent
will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company or its counsel. On the date of filing, the
date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of
the Company Stockholder Meeting, no Other Required Parent Filing may contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to any information supplied by the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent Filing.
The information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at the time that
such Other Required Parent Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

(d) _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will furnish all information
concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC
of the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing or any Other
Required Parent Filing. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder
Meeting any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective

 



-51- 

    

 Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any
Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, then the Party that discovers such information will promptly
notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing
describing such information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC
by the appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable law or the
SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

 

(e) _Consultation Prior to Certain Communications_. The Company and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, without
first providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such written communication, and each Party will give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the other Parties or their respective counsel.

(f) _Notices_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any amendment or
revisions to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any
Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any receipt of
comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, any Other Required
Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; or
(iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional
information in connection therewith.

(g) _Dissemination of Proxy Statement_. Subject to applicable law, the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that
it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the Proxy
Statement; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to mail the
Proxy Statement prior to August 26, 2019.

 

6.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) _Call of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the Company will take all action necessary in accordance with the
DGCL, the Charter, the Bylaws and the rules of NASDAQ to establish a record
date for (and the Company will not change the record date without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed)), duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval; provided that such Company Stockholder Meeting
shall not be required prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date. Within one (1)
Business Day after the date of this Agreement (and thereafter, upon the
reasonable request of Parent), the Company shall conduct a "broker search" in
accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act for a record date for the
Company Stockholder Meeting that is twenty (20) Business Days after the date
of such "broker search." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company will not be required to convene and hold the Company
Stockholder Meeting at any time prior to the twentieth (20th) Business Day
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders.
Subject to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 5.3_ and unless there has been a Company Board
Recommendation Change, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

 

(b) _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are
holders of an insufficient number of shares of the Company Common Stock
present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to
constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting;

 



-52- 

    

 (ii) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting by applicable law, order or a request from the SEC or its staff; (iii)
the Company has notified Parent pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ that
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _S_
_ection_ __ _ 5.3(e)(ii)_ and the applicable notice period thereunder will
not have expired prior to the then-scheduled date and time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting; or (iv) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
such postponement or adjournment is required by applicable law in order to
give the Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information
or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company Stockholders or
otherwise made available to the Company Stockholders by issuing a press
release, filing materials with the SEC or otherwise. Unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.1_, the Company
will submit this Agreement and the Merger to its stockholders at the Company
Stockholder Meeting even if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has
effected a Company Board Recommendation Change.

6.5 _Financing_.

 

(a) _No Amendments to Commitment Letters_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy pursuant to, the Commitment Letters without the prior written consent
of the Company, if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Financing to less than the amount needed to
satisfy the Required Amounts (taking into account other debt or equity
financing), (ii) impose new or additional conditions to receipt of the
Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to
receipt of the Financing or (iii) otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any
provision of the Commitment Letters in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (A) delay or make less likely the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to receipt of the Financing) on the Closing
Date or (B) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Commitment Letters. Any reference in this
Agreement to (1) the "Financing" will include the financing contemplated by
the applicable Commitment Letter as amended or modified in compliance with
this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.5_; and (2) "Commitment Letter" will include the
applicable document as amended or modified in compliance with this _S_
_ection_ __ _ 6.5_.

 

(b) _Taking of Necessary Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange and
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the applicable
Commitment Letters, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Commitment Letters in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof until the funding of the applicable
Financing; (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding of the
Financing that are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the applicable
Commitment Letter; (iii) assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
precedent set forth in Article VII, consummate the Financing at or prior to
the Closing and (iv) comply with its obligations pursuant to the Commitment
Letters.

 

(c) _Enforcement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.5_ will require,
and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be
deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) bring any
enforcement action against any source of the Financing to enforce its rights
pursuant to the applicable Commitment Letter (it being understood that Parent
and Merger Sub will seek to enforce, including by bringing suit for specific
performance, the Equity Commitment Letter if the Company seeks and is granted
a decree of specific performance of the obligation to consummate the Merger);
or (ii) subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(e)_ with respect to Substitute
Financing, seek the Financing from any source other than a counterparty to,
or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the applicable Commitment
Letter.

(d)  _Notifications_. Upon request of the Company, Parent shall keep the
Company reasonably informed of the status of Parents efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing. Parent shall promptly notify the Company if at any 

 



-53- 

    

 time (i) the Debt Commitment Letter is terminated or expires (or if any
person attempts or purports to terminate or repudiate the Debt Commitment
Letter, whether or not such attempted or purported termination or repudiation
is valid), (ii) Parent obtains knowledge of any breach or default or any
threatened (in writing) breach or default (or any event or circumstance that,
with or without due notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach or default) of the Debt Commitment Letter
by any party thereto, (iii) Parent receives written communication from any
Financing Source with respect to any actual, potential or threatened
breach, default, termination or repudiation of the Debt Commitment Letter or
(iv) Parents good faith belief that it will no longer be able to obtain the
Debt Financing in an amount necessary to satisfy the Required Amounts on the
Closing Date. 

(e) _Substitute Financing_. If all or any portion of the Debt Financing
expires or is terminated or all or any portion thereof becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter and such portion is required to satisfy
the Required Amounts (after giving effect to any other equity and/or debt
financing that may then be available to cover such unavailable amount), Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event to (i) notify the Company in writing thereof and
the reasons therefor and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain, at its sole expense, substitute financing sufficient to cover such
unavailable amount on terms and conditions and conditions that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent (in the reasonable judgment of Parent)
than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter as of the
date hereof (the " _Substitute Financing_ "). Parent shall deliver any
commitment letter related to such Substitute Financing to the Company
promptly after execution thereof (together with the related fee letters (in
the case of the fee letters, redacted in a manner consistent with _Section_ __
_ 4.11_)). Other than for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 4.11_, upon obtaining
any commitment for any such Substitute Financing, such financing shall be
deemed to be a part of the "Debt Financing", each debt commitment letter for
such Substitute Financing shall be deemed a "Debt Commitment Letter" and each
financing source in respect of such Substitute Financing shall be deemed a
"Financing Source", in each case for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

6.6 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) _Cooperation_. The Company will promptly furnish Parent with the Required
Information. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable

occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to (A) permit the

Surviving Corporation); and (B) cause the direct borrowing or incurrence of
all of the proceeds of the Debt Financing, including any high-yield debt
financing, by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
concurrently with or immediately following the Effective Time; and

(x) promptly furnishing (and in any event at least three Business Days prior
to the Closing Date) Parent and the Financing Sources with all documentation
and other information about the Company Group as is reasonably requested by
Parent relating to applicable "know your customer", beneficial ownership and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of
2001 and the beneficial ownership certification required by 31 C.F.R. §
1010.230.

 

(b) _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.6_ will
require the Company Group to (i) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement
or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time
for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise
indemnified by or on behalf of Parent; (ii) enter into any definitive
agreement that is effective prior to the Closing; (iii) give any indemnities
in connection with the Debt Financing that are effective prior to the

to any property or assets of the Company Group. In addition, (A) no action,
liability or obligation of the Company Group or any of its Representatives
pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument
relating to the Debt Financing (other than customary representation
letters and authorization letters (including with respect to the presence or
absence of material non-public information and the accuracy of the information
contained in the disclosure and marketing materials related to the Debt
Financing)) will be effective until the Effective Time, and the Company Group
will not be required to take any action pursuant to any certificate,
agreement, arrangement, document or instrument (other than customary
representation letters and authorization letters (including with respect to
the presence or absence of material non-public information and the accuracy of
the information contained in the disclosure and marketing materials related
to the Debt Financing)) that is not contingent on the occurrence of the
Closing or that must be effective prior to the Effective Time; and (B) any
bank information memoranda and high-yield offering prospectuses or memoranda
required in relation to the Debt Financing will contain disclosure reflecting
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries as the obligor. Nothing in this

 



-55- 

    

  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.6_ will require (1) any officer or Representative of
the Company Group to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other
action under this  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.6_ that could reasonably be expected
to result in personal liability to such officer or Representative; or (2) the
Company Board to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto.

 

(c) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such

Company Group and (ii) are used solely in connection with a description
of the Company, its business and products, the Debt Financing or the Merger.

(d) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement will be kept confidential, subject to customary confidentiality
provisions on the part of any financing sources or prospective financing

in settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with their
cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing pursuant to this Agreement or the

behalf of the Company Group, including financial statements, or (ii) the
willful misconduct, fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the Company
Group. Parents obligations pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.6(e)_ and this

not a condition to the Closing.

6.7 _A_ _nti-Takeover  Laws_. The Company and the Company Board (and any
committee empowered to take such action, if applicable) will (a) take all
actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute or
similar statute or regulation (or, in the case of Section 203 of the DGCL,
the restrictions on "business combinations" contained therein) is or becomes
applicable to the Merger; and (b) if any "anti-takeover" statute or similar
statute or regulation (or, in the case of Section 203 of the DGCL, the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained therein) becomes applicable

upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books and records and
personnel of the Company, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a)
any applicable law or regulation requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such
documents or information

 



-56- 

    

 would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or
information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company Group is a party
or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a
third Person the right to terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such

third Persons; or (e) such documents or information relate to the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement, are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal

_ection_ __ _ 5.3_, an Acquisition Proposal. Nothing in this _S_ _ection_ __
_ 6.8_ will be construed to require the Company Group or any of its
Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or
other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.8_ will be conducted in a manner
that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Company Group or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company Group. Any access to the properties of the
Company Group will be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures
and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive
testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply
to any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in
connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.8_. All requests for access pursuant
to this  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.8_ must be directed to the General Counsel of
the Company, or another person designated by the Company.

 

6.9 _S_ _ection 16(b)_ _Exemption_. The Company will take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with
the Merger by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the
Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

6.10 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company Group
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company Group and
any of their respective current or former directors or officers (and any
person who becomes a director or officer of the Company Group prior to the
Effective Time) (collectively, the "Indemnified Persons") for any acts or
omissions by such Indemnified Persons occurring prior to the Effective Time.
In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and
other similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set
forth in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar
organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable,
as of the date of this Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions
may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as
required by applicable law.

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with, and the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational
documents of, the Company Group in effect on the date of this Agreement, each
Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including
attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in
connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or
indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Persons capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company Group or other
Affiliates to the extent that such action or omission, or alleged action or
omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time; and (ii) the

 



-57- 

    

 Transactions, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent), except that if,
at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.10(b)_, then the claim
asserted in such notice will survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event
of any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the
right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being
understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the
Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to
the Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto); (B) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her
own counsel, including but not limited to Goodwin Procter LLP, (the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of which counsel will be paid by
the Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to
control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving
Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of
any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal
Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the
defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be
liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her
prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary
damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates will settle
or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes
an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising
out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination of whether any Indemnified
Person is entitled to indemnification by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, including any determination required to be
made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or
complied with any applicable standard, such Indemnified Person shall have the
right to require that such determination be made by special, independent legal
counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be
reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person).

 

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions,
retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the DandO
Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this  _S_ _ection_ __ _
6.10(c)_, the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for
its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium").
If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance carrier.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a prepaid "tail" policy
with respect to the DandO Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for such "tail" policy
does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase
such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder for so long as such "tail" policy is in full force and effect.

 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
in such consolidation or merger; (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person; or (iii) dissolves, then proper
provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the

 



-58- 

    

 Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.10_.

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this  _S_ _ection_ __ _
6.10_ may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the
prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person.
Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries
pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _S_ _ection_
__ _ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third
party beneficiaries of this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.10_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other
persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) pursuant to this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.10_ will be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons
may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar
organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all
indemnification agreements entered into with the Company Group; or (iv)
applicable law (whether at law or in equity).

(f) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will
be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy,
indemnification agreement, certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar
organizational document that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company Group for any of its directors, officers or other employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _S_
_ection_ __ _ 6.10_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims
pursuant to such policies or agreements.

6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Employment; Benefits_. As of the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or
one of its Subsidiaries will continue to employ the Continuing Employees. For
a period of not less than one (1) year following the Effective Time (the
"Continuation Period") the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee compensation and employee
benefits (other than equity-based benefits) at compensation and benefit levels
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect at the
Company Group immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for at least the duration of the Continuation Period, base
compensation and target incentive compensation opportunity (each as in effect
at the Company Group on the date of this Agreement) will not be decreased for
any Continuing Employee employed during the Continuation Period.

(b)  _Severance Programs_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
honor all Employee Plans set forth in _S_ _ection_ __ _ 3.18(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or
termination thereof that may be permitted by such Employee Plans and except as
provided herein.

 

(c) _New Plans_. To the extent that a new employee benefit plan is made
available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time (each a
"New Plan"), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be
granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company
Group prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant
(including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement),
except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, where applicable,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that: (i) at the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in each New
Plan to the extent such waiting time was satisfied under a 

 



-59- 

    

 similar or comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the "Old Plans"), (ii) at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations
and actively-at-work requirements of each New Plan that is a health plan to be
waived or satisfied for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under the analogous Old Plan as
of the Effective Time and (iii) at the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause all eligible expenses incurred by
each Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(d) _2019 Fiscal Year Bonus Plan_. Notwithstanding any permitted amendment,
termination or discretion applicable to any Employee Plan that provides for
the payment of annual cash bonuses, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) to the extent not already paid prior to Closing, pay bonuses
to Continuing Employees who remain employed through December 31, 2019
(whether or not employed on the payment date) in respect of fiscal year 2019
("2019 Bonuses") (i) to Continuing Employees that are eligible for such
bonus payments and (ii) in an amount determined by the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) in good faith and in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice based on actual achievement of applicable
performance goals which 2019 Bonuses in the aggregate shall not exceed the
amount set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.11(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.
The 2019 Bonuses shall be paid by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, at the time or times that the 2019 Bonuses would normally be paid
by the Company in the ordinary course of business (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, subject to any continuing employment conditions).

 

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ will not be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii)
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to continue any Employee Plan or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create
any third party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) establish, amend or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

 

6.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent will take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by either
of them to perform and discharge any of their respective covenants,
agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

6.13  _Notification of Certain Matters_.

with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __
_ VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company will give prompt notice to Parent
upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such
untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger set forth in _S_ _ection_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or _S_ _ection_ __ _ 7.2(b)_
to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except that no such notification will
affect or be deemed to

 



-60- 

    

 modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this
Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to
any information provided to Parent pursuant to this _S_ _ection_ __ _
6.13(a)_.

 

(b) _Notification by Parent_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _
VIII_ and the Effective Time, Parent will give prompt notice to the Company
upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by Parent or
Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only
to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the Merger set forth in _S_ _ection_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or _S_ _ection_
__ _ 7.3(b)_ to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except that no such
notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the
obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger or the remedies available
to the Parties under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to the Company
pursuant to this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.13(b)_.

6.14 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning
this Agreement and the Transactions will be a joint press release reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent (the "Announcement"). Thereafter, the

Recommendation Change), on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consult with
the other Parties before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b)
engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional investors or
other similar Persons; or (c) providing any statements that are public or are

in such consultation with respect to communications that are (i) required by
applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule or listing agreement; (ii)
principally directed to employees, suppliers, customers, partners or vendors
so long as such communications are consistent with the previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties
(or individually if approved by the other Party); or (iii) principally related
to a Superior Proposal or Company Board Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 6.14_ shall not apply to any press
release or other public statement made by the Company or Parent (x) that is
consistent with the Announcement and the terms of this Agreement and does not
contain any information relating to the Company or Parent that has not been
previously announce or made public in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or (y) is made in the ordinary course of business and does not
relate specifically to the signing of this Agreement or the Transactions.

6.15 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
provide Parent with prompt notice of all Transaction Litigation (including by
providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company will (a)
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or
prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with Parent with
respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation. The Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement

afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such Transaction
Litigation, prior to the Effective Time, except for the settlement or
compromise consent set forth above. All rights to indemnification or retention
of counsel shall be subject to the terms set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

applicable law and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ to cause (a) the
delisting of the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time; and (b) the deregistration of the Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such

6.17 _Additional Agreements_. If at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all

Party will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action.

6.18 _Parent Vote_. Effective immediately following the execution and

business or operations of the other at any time prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will exercise,

Company immediately before the Closing (including pursuant to the repayment
of outstanding intercompany obligations) any cash balances held by any
non-U.S. Subsidiaries of the Company provided, however, that no distribution
or transfer will be required to be made (a) to the extent that such
distribution or transfer would be subject to withholding or other Taxes in
advance of the Effective Time, and (b) unless and until all of the conditions
of the Merger set forth in Article VII have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived (if
permitted hereunder) at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions at the Closing), and
Parent has confirmed that it is prepared to consummate the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties agree
that if the Company and its Subsidiaries distribute or transfer any cash
pursuant to this _Section 6.21_ at the request of Parent, then the
representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement shall only be
required to be made and shall apply as if no such distribution or transfer of
cash pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.21_ had occurred, including, without
limitation for purposes of any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_.

terminate this Agreement pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ or _S_
_ection_ __ _ 8.1(i)_; or (2) the Company if Parent has the valid right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.1(e)_; and (ii)
any Party whose action or failure to act (which action or failure to act

cause of, or primarily resulted in, either (A) the failure to satisfy the
conditions to the obligations of the terminating Party to consummate the
Merger set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_ prior to the Termination Date; or (B)
the failure of the Effective Time to have occurred prior to the Termination
Date (it being agreed that Parent and Merger Sub shall be a single Party for

pursuant to this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.1(e)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then in
breach of any of their respective representations, warranties or covenants
under this Agreement so as to cause the conditions set forth in _S_ _ection_
__ _ 7.3(a)_ or _S_ _ection_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ not to be satisfied;

8.2 _Manner and Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) _Manner of Termination_. The Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to
_S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.1_ (other than pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.1(a)_)
must deliver prompt written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth
in reasonable detail the provision of _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.1_ pursuant to
which this Agreement is being terminated and the facts and circumstances
forming the basis for such termination pursuant to such provision.

(b)  _Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.1_ will be effective immediately
upon the mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery
of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. In the event
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.1_, this
Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of
any Party (or any partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer,
employee, Affiliate, agent or other representative of such Party) to the other
Parties, as applicable, except that _S_ _ection_ __ _ 4.15_,  _Section_ __ _
6.6(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.6(e)_,

 



-66- 

    

  _Section_ __ _ 6.6(f)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.14_, this _S_ _ection_ __ _

termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.
Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.3(f)_,
nothing in this Agreement will relieve any Party from any liability for any
willful breach of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful
breach" means a material breach of this Agreement that is the consequence of
an act or omission by a Party with the actual knowledge or intention that the
taking of such act or omission would constitute a material breach of this
Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement will

Agreement or the Limited Guarantee, which rights, obligations and agreements
will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their
respective terms.

 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions will be paid
by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is

will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. Parent
will pay or cause to be paid all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or
fees; and (ii) sales, use, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or
fees arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement
and the consummation of the Merger. With respect to the preparation and
filing of tax returns as related to the foregoing Taxes, Parent and the
Company Group shall cooperate with each other and provide such documents and
assistance as may be necessary to prepare all such tax returns, and Parent
shall timely file such tax returns.

(b) _Company Payments_.

 

(i) If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_,
_Section 8.1(d)_ or  _Section 8.1(e)_; (B) at the time of such termination,
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ and _Section 7.1(c)_ have been
satisfied or are capable of being satisfied and the conditions set forth in 
_Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_ would be satisfied if the date of such
termination was the Closing Date; (C) following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_, _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_, an Acquisition
Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction has been publicly announced or
disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (D) within one (1)
year following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)_, _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_, as applicable, either an
Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a
definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition
Transaction and such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated, then
the Company will concurrently with the consummation of such
Acquisition Transaction pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent an amount equal
to $24,750,000 (the "Company Termination Fee"). For purposes of this _S_
_ection_ __ _ 8.3(b)(i)_, all references to "20%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Transaction" will be deemed to be references to "50%."

(ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _
8.1(f)_, then the Company must promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) following such termination pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent
the Company Termination Fee. 

(iii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _
8.1(h)_, then prior to or concurrently with such termination the Company must
pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent the Company Termination Fee; _provided_ ,
that if such termination occurs prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and the
Company has entered into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement to
consummate an Acquisition Transaction at the time of such termination, then
the "Company Termination Fee" shall mean an amount equal to $12,375,000.

 

(c) _Parent Payments_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _S_
_ection_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ due to the willful breach of this Agreement by Parent
or Merger Sub or _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.1(i)_, then Parent must promptly (and in

 



-67- 

    

 any event within two (2) Business Days) following such termination pay to
the Company an amount equal to $49,500,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee").

 

(d) _Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages_. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that in no event will the Company or Parent be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than
one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination
Fee, as applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of
this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of
different events. The Parties agree that each of the Company Termination Fee
and the Parent Termination Fee constitutes liquidated damages and not a
penalty.

 

(e) _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the Merger, and that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
_S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ or Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due
pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.3(c)_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Legal
Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set
forth in _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ or any portion thereof or a judgment
against Parent for the amount set forth in _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.3(c)_ or any
portion thereof, as applicable, then the non-paying Party will pay or cause
to be paid to the other Party its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in
connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount
or portion thereof at the annual rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published
in _T_ _he Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date that such payment or
portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment
or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the
maximum permitted by applicable law (collectively, the "Fee Enforcement
Expenses"). All payments under this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.3_ to be made by the
Company to Parent shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Parent, and all payments under
this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.3_ to be made by Parent to the Company shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in writing by the Company.

(f) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

(i) Under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for breaches under this
Agreement, the Limited Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter, taking into
account the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, the Reimbursement
Obligations and the Fee Enforcement Expenses pursuant to this Agreement and
the Enforcement Expenses (as defined in the Limited Guarantee), exceed the
aggregate amount of $51,000,000 (the "Parent Liability Limitation"). Other

Financing Sources, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub or the
Guarantor), members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or

clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the "Parent Related Parties"), and in no
event will the Company Group be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary
damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive

Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Equity Commitment
Letter, the Limited Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (including, any breach by the Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub), the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate any of the
Transactions or any claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any
such breach, termination or failure. Other than the Guarantors obligations
under the Limited Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter, other than the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this
Agreement and other than the obligations of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates to the extent expressly provided in the
Confidentiality

 



-68-

monetary damages to the Company or any other Person relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

(ii) Parents receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed
pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, will be the only monetary damages that

(A) the Company Group and each of its Affiliates; and (B) the former, current
and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or

connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate any of the
Transactions or any claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any
such breach, termination or failure, and upon payment of such amount, (1) none
of the Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation
to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any
agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis of such termination
(except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with
respect to, and Parent and Merger Sub may be entitled to remedies with respect
to (x) the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) the Fee Enforcement Expenses,
which such expenses, together with the Company Termination Fee, shall not
exceed the amount of the Company Liability Limitation); and (2) none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain
any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any Company Related
Party arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any
matters forming the basis for such termination (except that the Parties (or
their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and Parent and Merger
Sub may be entitled to remedies with respect to (x) the Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) the Fee Enforcement Expenses, which such expenses, together

the Company for breaches under this Agreement, taking into account the
payment of the Company Termination Fee and the Fee Enforcement Expenses
pursuant to this Agreement, exceed the aggregate amount of $26,250,000 (the
"Company Liability Limitation"). In no event will any of the Parent Related
Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or
any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person
be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award in
excess of the Company Liability Limitation against any of the Company Related
Parties, and in no event will Parent, Merger Sub or the Parent Related Parties
be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including
consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the
Company Liability Limitation against the Company Related Parties for, or with
respect to, this Agreement or the Transactions, the termination of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate any of the Transactions or any claims or
actions under applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or
failure. Other than the obligations of the Company to the extent expressly
provided in this Agreement, in no event will any Company Related Party or any
other Person other than the Company have any liability for monetary damages to
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions.

 

(iv) The Companys receipt of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed
pursuant to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.3(c)_, will be the only monetary damages
that the Company Group may recover from the Parent Related Parties in respect
of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate any of the Transactions or any claims or
actions under applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or
failure, and upon payment of such amount, (1) none of the Parent Related
Parties will have any further liability or obligation to the Company or any
Company Related Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any
agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis of such termination
(except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with

Limited Guarantee), which collectively such items under this clause (y) and
the Parent Termination Fee shall not exceed the amount of the Parent Liability
Limitation); and (2) none of the Company Group or any other Person will be
entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Parent,
Merger Sub or any Parent Related Party arising out of this Agreement, any
agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination

performance or other equitable relief subject to the terms and limitations in
_S_ _ection_ __ _ 9.8(b)_, except that, although the Company, in its sole
discretion, may determine its choice of remedies hereunder, including by
pursuing specific performance in accordance with, but subject to the terms
and limitations of, _Section 9.8(b)_, under no circumstances will the Company
be permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance of the type
contemplated by  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ and monetary damages.

(h) _Non-Recourse Parent Party_. In no event will the Company or any Company
Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of its
Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or

be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of the Company
Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL without such approval. Notwithstanding

accordance with their terms or are validly terminated by the parties thereto.

9.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _S_ _ection_ __ _
6.6(f)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ and this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 9.6_, the Parties
agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set
forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is
not intended to, and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by _S_
_ection_ __ _ 6.6(f)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.10_; and (b) from and after the
Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
and Company Stock-Based Awards to receive the merger consideration set forth
in _Article_ __ _ II_. The rights granted pursuant to clause (b) of the
second sentence of this  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 9.6_ will only be enforceable on
behalf of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock-Based
Awards by the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, as agent for such
holders, and it is understood and agreed that any and all interests in such
claims will attach to such shares of the Company Common Stock or Company
Stock-Based Awards and subsequently transfer therewith and, consequently, any
damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received by the Company
with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by the Company in
connection therewith and subject to the limitations set forth in _S_ _ection_
__ _ 8.3(f)_) may, in the Companys sole and absolute discretion, be (A)
distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to such holders as of any
date determined by the Company; or (B) retained by the Company for the use and
benefit of the Company in any manner that the Company deems fit. The
provisions of _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.3(f)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, _Section_
__ _ 8.6_, _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(i)_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.9_, _Section_ __ _
9.10_, _Section_ __ _ 9.11_, _Section_ __ _ 9.16_ and this _S_ _ection_ __ _
9.6_ will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and their successors
and assigns, each of whom are intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof
(it being understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections will be
directly enforceable by the Financing Sources and their respective successors
and assigns).

9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

9.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages, under no
circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing
and monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance).

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform the provisions of this

 



-73- 

    

 Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required
of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that, subject to _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.6_ and _Section 9.8(b)(ii)_,
(A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof;
(B) the provisions of  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 8.3_ are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any
respect any Partys right to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent
would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary, in no event shall the Company, any Subsidiary of
the Company or any other member of the Company Group, or any of their
respective Affiliates be entitled to seek equitable remedies, including, by
way of example, an injunction or specific performance of this Agreement,
against any Financing Source.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(i)_ or anything else to the
contrary, it is expressly agreed that the right of the Company to obtain an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection
with enforcing Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded
(including to cause Parent to enforce the obligations of the Guarantor under
the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be
timely completed in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter), shall be subject to the
requirements that: (A) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that
(i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _
7.2_ have been satisfied (and continue to be satisfied) or waived (other than
those conditions that by their nature are intended to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to those conditions being capable of being satisfied at
the Closing) at the time when the Closing would have occurred or been
required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, (ii) if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing and Equity Financing were funded
in accordance with the terms thereof, the Closing will occur and (iii) if the
Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, then it is prepared,
willing and able to effect the Closing to occur pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement; and (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter at the Closing (if
the Equity Financing is funded in accordance with the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter at the Closing); _provided_ , that in no case shall Parent
or Merger Sub be required to draw down the Equity Commitment Letter or
consummate the Merger if the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) is
not in fact funded at the Closing.

 

(iii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the
specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party
irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

9.9 _G_ _overning Law_. This Agreement is governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that all actions involving a
Financing Source that is in any way related to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any action arising out
of or relating to the Debt Commitment Letter) shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to conflict of laws principles or rules to the extent such
principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of another
jurisdiction.

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to
the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether
inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any
Legal Proceeding relating to the Transactions, for and on behalf of itself or
any of its properties or assets, in accordance with  _S_ _ection_ __ _ 9.2_
or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable law, and nothing in
this _S_ _ection_ __ _ 9.10_ will affect the right of any Party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable law; (ii)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties
and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any federal court within the State of Delaware) (the "Chosen Courts") in the
event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the
Limited Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any
Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, the Limited
Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will be brought,
tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the
Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an
inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees
that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the
Limited Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any
court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen
Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

(b) _Jurisdiction for Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i)
that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to,
the Merger, the Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder or
related thereto will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and
any appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself and its
property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their
Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal
Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process, summons, notice
or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses
provided in any applicable debt commitment letter will be effective service of
process against them for any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court;
(iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be
governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
Each of the Parties further agrees that it shall not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Source, in any way relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, but, for the avoidance of doubt,
other than any definitive agreements executed in connection with the Debt
Financing or the performance thereof.

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE LIMITED GUARANTEE, THE EQUITY
COMMITMENT LETTER, THE DEBT FINANCING (INCLUDING THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER 

 



-75- 

    

 OR THE FEE LETTER) OR THE EQUITY FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL
PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _S_
_ECTION_ __ _ 9.11_.

 

9.12 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The Parties agree that the
disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the
corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only
if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

 

9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same
agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar
attachment to email (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart
and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were
the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise
the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent
such defense relates to lack of authenticity. 

9.14 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent
possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given
to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and
closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative and
that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this
Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing set
forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed to limit the scope,
applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.

 

9.15 _Performance Guarantee_. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and
faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the
obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of Merger Sub under
this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, including any such
obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings that are required
to be performed, discharged or complied with following the Effective Time by
the Surviving Corporation.

9.16 _Waiver of Claims Against Financing Sources_. None of the Financing
Sources will have any liability to the Company or its Affiliates relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at
law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company
nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any of the
Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder; provided that the foregoing will
not limit the rights of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive documentation entered into by Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing with respect thereto (including the commitment to fund the amounts
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter on the Closing Date).
