\- 15 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Statement delivered by Purchaser), the Adjustment Amount Statement delivered

events occurs.

  

  

(d) If the Seller Representative has timely delivered an Adjustment Notice,

and the Seller Representative have not agreed in writing to the resolution of
the matters identified in the Adjustment Notice, then such matters shall be
submitted to an independent accounting firm as may be agreed by the Seller
Representative and Purchaser (the "Independent Accountants") for resolution.
Each of Sellers and Purchaser agree that it shall not engage, directly or
indirectly, or agree to engage, the Independent Accountants to perform any
services other than as the Independent Accountants pursuant hereto until the
Adjustment Amount Statement and items thereon have been finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.6(d). Each of the Seller Representative and
Purchaser agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Accountants, a
reasonable engagement letter. Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall
instruct the Independent Accountants to review this Agreement and the disputed
items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Adjustment Amount and the
Post-Closing Payment. In making such calculation, the Independent Accountants
shall consider only those items or amounts in the Adjustment Amount Statement
and Purchaser's calculation of the Adjustment Amount and the Post-Closing
Payment as to which the Seller Representative has disagreed in the Adjustment
Notice. The Independent Accountants shall deliver to Purchaser and the Seller
Representative, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than
thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the Independent Accountants),
a report setting forth such calculation and the Adjustment Amount Statement
shall be deemed to be amended to reflect the calculation of the Adjustment
Amount and the Post-Closing Payment as determined by the Independent
Accountants and shall be deemed the "Final Adjustment Amount Statement." The
scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accountants is limited
to whether the amounts set forth on the line items on the Adjustment Amount
Statement were obtained from and in accordance with the books and records of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and are in accordance with U.S. GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with prior periods and in conformity with the
principles used by the Company in the preparation of its Financial Statements,
and whether there were mathematical errors in the Adjustment Amount Statement,
in each case, to the extent related to the unresolved items set forth in the
Adjustment Notice, and the Independent Accountants are not to make any other
determination. Purchaser shall, and shall exercise the voting, governance and
contractual powers available to it to cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to, furnish or cause to be furnished to the Independent
Accountants access to such employees, officers, and facilities and such books
and records relating to the disputed items as the Independent Accountants may
reasonably request. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall
be borne fifty percent (50%) by Sellers (allocated among Sellers according to
their respective Proportional Shares), on the one hand, and fifty percent
(50%) by Purchaser, on the other hand. The Final Adjustment Amount Statement
(including the calculation of the Post-Closing Payment thereon) as determined
by the Independent Accountants shall

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 16 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

be final, non-appealable and binding upon Purchaser, the Seller Representative
and Sellers. The Independent Accountants shall act as an expert, not as an
arbitrator.

  

  

(e) If the Post-Closing Payment is a negative amount, then Purchaser shall pay
to each Seller an amount in cash equal to such Seller's Proportional Share of
the Post-Closing Payment plus interest on such amount from (and including) the
Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of payment at the Specified Rate. If
the Post-Closing Payment is a positive amount, then Sellers shall collectively
pay to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the Post-Closing Payment
(allocated among Sellers according to their respective Proportional Shares)

Section 6.12 Most-Favored Customer; Non-Solicitation

  

  

(a) Each Seller hereby undertakes to the Company and Purchaser that the Seller
will, and will procure that its Affiliates will

  

  

(i) in the event that the Seller or any of its Affiliates intends to sell or
dispose of solar-grade polysilicon ingots ("Product"), first offer to the
Company and Purchaser the right to purchase the Product, and none of the
Seller or its Affiliates may proceed with such sale or disposal to any third
party, unless the terms of sale or disposal are not more favorable than those
offered to the Company and Purchaser following the rejection of such offer by
the Company or Purchaser; and

  

  

(ii) if at any time during the term of a supply contract between the Seller
and the Company and/or Purchaser ("Supply Contract"), the Seller or any of its
Affiliates sells any Product to a comparable customer for less than the price
of the Product ("Product Price") then in force for that Product, it shall
reduce the relevant Product Price to match the lower price for so long as the
lower price is available (but for no longer) and shall refund the Company
and/or Purchaser the difference between the Product Price and the lower price
in respect of its purchases of the Product after the Seller or any of its
Affiliates began charging the lower price. For the purposes of this clause,
"comparable" means a customer that purchases products in substantially similar
volumes as the Company and/or Purchaser on broadly similar terms and
conditions.

  

  

(b) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, none of Sellers
shall and each shall cause its respective Affiliates not to (i) solicit,
entice, persuade or induce any of the senior employees of Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries to terminate his or her
employment; (ii) solicit the employment of any such individual; or (iii) hire
or engage, as an officer, employee, consultant, independent contractor or
otherwise, any such individual, in each case without the prior written consent
of Purchaser. Nothing in this Section 6.12(b) shall prohibit any of the
foregoing activities with respect to any individual who has been terminated by
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries without cause
or who has not been employed by Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries during the ninety (90) days preceding any of such
action by any Seller or its Affiliates after such individual's resignation if
neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates has induced or attempted to induce
such employee to leave the employ of such entity at any time prior to such
termination or resignation.

  

  

(c) The length of time for which any covenant contained in this Section 6.12
shall be in force shall not include any period of violation or any other
period required for litigation during which Purchaser seeks to enforce such
covenant. In the

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 41 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

event that any such covenant shall be determined by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for too long a
period of time or over too large a geographical area or by reason of its being
too extensive in any other respect, it shall be interpreted to extend only
over the longest period of time for which it may be enforceable, and/or over
the largest geographical area as to which it may be enforceable and/or to the
maximum extent in all other respects as to which it may be enforceable, all as
determined by such court in such action.

  

  

(d) The covenants contained in this Section 6.12 are each independent of any
other provision of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim which any
party may allege against any other Party to this Agreement, whether based on
this Agreement or otherwise, shall not prevent the enforcement of these
covenants. Sellers acknowledge that Purchaser is purchasing the Acquired
Shares in reliance on the goodwill of the business and the covenants contained
in this Section 6.12 are essential to the protection of Purchaser's purchase
and that Purchaser would not purchase the Acquired Shares but for these
covenants. Sellers (i) acknowledge and agree that the monetary damages for any
material breach of this Section 6.12 would be inadequate, and (ii) agree and
consent that without intending to limit any additional remedies that may be
available, temporary and permanent injunctive and other equitable relief may
be granted in any action that may be brought to enforce any of the provisions
of this Section 6.12.

  

  

Section 6.13 Post-Closing Circular 75 Registration. Sellers shall cause each
Person who is a Circular 75 Security Holder report and file with SAFE any
change in the equity interests of the Company held by each of them, including
the sale of all of their Acquired Shares as contemplated under this Agreement,
as soon as practicable after the Closing and in any event within three (3)
months after the Closing, in accordance with the requirements under the SAFE
Rules and Regulations.

  

  

Section 6.14 Release. For and in consideration of the covenants and promises
set forth in this Agreement, and subject to and effective upon the Closing,
each Seller, on behalf of itself and its assigns, heirs, beneficiaries,
creditors, representatives, agents and Affiliates (other than the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, the "Releasing Parties"), hereby fully and finally
releases, acquits and forever discharges the Company, each Company Subsidiary
and each of the Company's and Company Subsidiary's present and former direct
or indirect partners, members and shareholders and the past and present
officers, directors, partners, members, stockholders, trustees, shareholders,
representatives, employees, agents, Affiliates, subsidiaries, predecessors,
successors, assigns, beneficiaries, heirs, trustees, executors, insurers and
attorneys of any of them (collectively, the "Released Parties") from any and
all actions, debts, claims, counterclaims, demands, liabilities, damages,
causes of action, costs, expenses, and compensation of every kind and nature
whatsoever, past, present, or future, at law or in equity, whether known or
unknown, which such Releasing Parties, or any of them, had, has, or may have
had at any time in the past until and including the date of this Agreement
against the Released Parties, or any of them, including but not limited to any
claims which relate to or arise out of such Releasing Party's prior
relationship with the Company or his rights or status as a shareholder,
officer or director of the Company, except for claims arising under or
pursuant to Section 9.2(c) of this Agreement. Each

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 42 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Seller hereby represents and warrants that it has adequate information
regarding the terms of this Agreement, the scope and effect of the releases
set forth in this Section 6.14, and all other matters encompassed by this
Section 6.14 to make an informed and knowledgeable decision with regard to
this Section 6.14, and that it has independently and without reliance upon the
Released Parties made its own analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Seller further agrees not to institute any litigation,
lawsuit, claim or action against any Released Party with respect to any and
all claims released in this Section 6.14. Each Seller acknowledges that it has
had the benefit of advice of competent legal counsel with respect to its
decision to enter into the release provided for in this Section 6.14. Each
Seller further acknowledges that the consideration payable to him pursuant to
this Agreement provides good and sufficient consideration for the releases set
forth in this Section 6.14. This Section 6.14 is intended to benefit each of
the Released Parties and their respective heirs and personal representatives,
each whom shall be entitled to enforce the provisions hereof.

  

  

Section 6.15 Intra-Group Payables and Intra-Group Receivables. Prior to
Closing, the Company shall, and each Seller shall cause the Company to, settle
substantially all Intra-Group Payables and Intra-Group Receivables in a manner
to be reasonably agreed by Purchaser in writing.

  

  

Section 6.16 Minimum Net Cash Balance. The Company shall, and each Seller
shall cause the Company to, have on hand a Net Cash Balance of at least US$
10,000,000 as operating cash required for the daily operation of the Company

environmental facilities in relation to its quartz crucibles production
project and the related projects;

  

  

(vii) the failure of SSV to obtain all necessary permits required for
pollution and waste discharge at any and all of its production facilities;

  

  

(viii) that SSV is not released from any and all of its obligations under the
contract of guarantee between SSV and the Hebei Branch of the Bank of
Communications at Closing;

  

  

(ix) the renewal of SSV's Customs Declaration Registration Certificate for
Consignees or Consignors of Imports or Exports.

  

  

(b) Indemnification by Sellers for Seller's Breaches. From and after the
Closing, each Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees from and
against all Losses arising out of or relating to:

  

  

(i) a breach of any representation or warranty made by such Seller contained
in ARTICLE III of this Agreement; or

  

  

(ii) a breach of any covenant or obligation to be performed by such Seller
under this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Indemnification by Purchaser. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
indemnify each Seller and their respective Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against all Losses, arising
out of or relating to:

  

  

(i) a breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser contained in
ARTICLE V of this Agreement; or

  

  

(ii) a breach of any covenant or obligation to be performed by Purchaser under
this Agreement.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 48 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes of
the indemnification provisions in Section 9.2(a)(i), Section 9.2(b)(i) and
Section 9.2(c)(i), the calculation of any Losses and the determination of
whether a breach has occurred shall be made without giving effect to any
"Material Adverse Effect" qualification or any materiality or similar
qualification contained in the representations and warranties contained
herein.

  

  

(d) Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

  

  

(i) Any party seeking indemnification under this Section 9.2 (an "Indemnified
Party") shall promptly give the party from whom indemnification is being
sought (an "Indemnifying Party") notice (a "Claim Notice") of any matter which
such Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement
stating in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, and containing a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right
of indemnification is claimed or arises; provided, however, that the failure
to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of
its obligations under this Section 9.2 except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. With respect to any recovery
or indemnification sought by an Indemnified Party from the Indemnifying Party
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, if the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim (the "Dispute
Notice"), the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed
with such claim. If the Indemnifying Party has disputed a claim for
indemnification (including any Third Party Claim), the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution to
such dispute. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party cannot
resolve such dispute in thirty (30) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice,
such dispute shall be resolved by pursuant to Section 10.3

  

  

(ii) The obligations and liabilities of an Indemnifying Party under this
Section 9.2 with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party
which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this Section 9.2
("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and contingent upon the following
additional terms and conditions: if an Indemnified Party shall receive notice
of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party notice of such Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days of the receipt
by the Indemnified Party of such notice and a copy of the papers served with
respect to such claim (if any); provided, however, that the failure to provide
such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Section 9.2 except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is materially prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party
acknowledges in

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 49 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against
any Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled, but not obligated, to assume and control the defense
of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party if it gives notice of its
intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days
of the receipt of the notice furnished by the Indemnified Party pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 9.2(d)(ii) provided, however, that in the
event the Indemnifying Party assumes and controls the defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, at its sole cost and expense,
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided, further, that
if counsel to the Indemnified Party advises such Indemnified Party in writing
that the Third Party Claim involves a conflict of interest (other than one of
a monetary nature) that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party (except that the Indemnifying Party shall
not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one separate
counsel for all Indemnified Parties, taken together). In the event the
Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense against
any such Third Party Claim as provided above, it will keep the Indemnified
Party reasonably informed of progress of the defense of such Third Party
Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party's
possession or under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the
Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against
any such Third Party Claim, it will keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably
informed of progress of the defense of such Third Party Claim, and the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnified Party all such witnesses, records,
materials and information in the Indemnifying Party's possession or under the
Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, the Indemnified Party shall not, without
the consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment in respect of such Third Party Claim. The
rights of any Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to any right of action
(including indemnification, cross-claims and counterclaims) that the
Indemnified Party may have against any other Person with respect to any matter
giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder. The Indemnifying Party
shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (i) settle or compromise

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 50 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or
plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a written release from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle or compromise any Third Party
Claim in any manner that may adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than
as a result of money damages or other money payments.

  

  

Section 9.3 Limitations on Claims

  

  

(a) Maximum Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, but subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.1, the rights
of any Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee under Section 9.2 shall be
subject to the following limitations:

  

  

(i) A Purchaser Indemnitee shall not be entitled to receive payment pursuant
to Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(b)(i) (x) in respect of any individual
claim for Losses if such individual claim does not exceed US$50,000 (an
"Excluded Claim") and (y) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses
incurred by all Purchaser Indemnitees and which are determined to be
indemnifiable based upon, arising out of or resulting from the breach of any
of the representations or warranties of the Company and Sellers exceeds the
Liability Basket Threshold, in which event a Purchaser Indemnitee shall be
entitled to the entire amount of such Losses; provided, however, that no
Excluded Claim shall be taken into account for purposes of determining whether
the Liability Basket Threshold has been met or exceeded; provided, further,
that the Excluded Claim and the Liability Basket Threshold limitations shall
not apply to Losses related to a breach of any of the representations and
warranties of (x) Sellers set forth in Section 3.1 (Organization and
Qualification), Section 3.2 (Ownership of Acquired Shares), Section 3.3
(Authorization) and Section 3.7 (Brokers and Finders) and (y) the Company set
forth in Section 4.1(a) (Organization and Qualification), Section 4.2
(Authorization), Section 4.3 (Capitalization), Section 4.11 (Employee Benefit
Plans), Section 4.19 (Brokers and Finders) and Section 4.21 (Circular 75
Registration) (collectively, the "Company Excluded Reps"). A Seller Indemnitee
shall not be entitled to receive payment pursuant to Section 9.2(c)(i) (x) in
respect of any individual claim for Losses if such individual claim is an
Excluded Claim and (y) unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses
incurred by all Seller Indemnitees and which are determined to be
indemnifiable based upon, arising out of or resulting from the breach of any
of the representations or warranties of Purchaser exceeds the Liability Basket
Threshold, in which event a Seller Indemnitee shall be entitled to the entire
amount of such Losses; provided, however, that no Excluded Claim shall be
taken into account for purposes of determining whether the Liability Basket
Threshold has been met or exceeded; provided, further, that the Excluded Claim
and the Liability Basket Threshold limitations shall not apply to Losses
related to a breach of any of the representations and warranties of Purchaser
set forth in

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 51 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

  

Section 5.1 (Organization and Qualification), Section 5.2 (Authorization) and
Section 5.6 (Brokers and Finders) of this Agreement (collectively, the
"Purchaser Excluded Reps"; and, together with the Company Excluded Reps, the
"Excluded Reps").

  

  

(ii) (A) The maximum aggregate amount of Losses for which Sellers shall be
liable pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(b)(i) (other than with
respect to the Company Excluded Reps), and for which Purchaser shall be liable
pursuant to Section 9.2(c)(i) (other than with respect to the Purchaser
Excluded Reps), shall in each case be an amount equal to seventy-five (75)
percent of the Final Purchase Price (the "Cap") and (B) the maximum aggregate
amount of Losses for which Sellers shall be liable pursuant to (w) Section
9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(b)(i) solely with respect to the Company Excluded
Reps and (x) Section 9.2(a)(ii) or Section 9.2(b)(ii), and for which Purchaser
shall be liable pursuant to (y) Section 9.2(c)(i) solely with respect to the
Purchaser Excluded Reps and (z) Section 9.2(c)(ii), shall in each case be an
amount equal to the Final Purchase Price (the "Purchase Price Cap"). For the
avoidance of doubt, the rights of any Purchaser Indemnitee for Losses pursuant
to Section 9.2(a)(iii) and Section 9.4 shall not be limited by the provisions
in Section 9.3(a)(i) or this Section 9.3(a)(ii) and shall be fully
reimbursable and any amounts paid in connection with any claims for such
Losses shall not be used in determining whether the Liability Basket
Threshold, Cap or Purchase Price Cap has been met.

  

  

(b) Additional Limitations.

  

  

(i) The amount of any Losses incurred by any Indemnified Party shall be
reduced by the net amount such Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
recovers (after deducting all attorneys' fees, expenses and other costs of
recovery) from any insurer or other party liable for such Losses (other than
any Party). Such Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best efforts to effect
any such recovery.

  

  

(ii) Any liability under this Agreement shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one warranty, covenant or
agreement.

  

  

(iii) No Party shall be entitled to recover the same Losses or obtain payment,
reimbursement or restitution for the same expenses more than once in respect
of any inaccuracy or breach of any provision of this Agreement. No liability
shall attach to any Party under this Agreement to the extent the subject
thereof has otherwise been made good or is compensated for.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 52 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

  

(iv) No matter shall be the subject of a claim to the extent that adequate
allowance, provision or reserve in respect of the Losses arising out of or
relating to such matter shall have been expressly made in the Financial
Statements.

  

  

(c) Limitation of Remedies.

  

  

(i) Except for the warranties set forth in this Agreement or any other
agreements contemplated by this Agreement or in any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto and thereto, none of Sellers nor its
Affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
subsidiaries, controlling persons, agents or representatives, makes or has
made, and each Seller and its Affiliates and all of their respective
directors, officers, employees, subsidiaries, controlling persons, agents or
representatives hereby negate and disclaim, any other warranty, written or
oral, statutory, express or implied, concerning the Acquired Shares, the
business, assets or liabilities of any of the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, warranties and covenants contained herein made by or on behalf
of a Party are made solely and exclusively by or on behalf of a Party and not
by or on behalf of such Party's representatives (including employees) or any
other person. The provisions of this Section 9.3(c)(i) are intended to be for
the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the respective Affiliates of Sellers,
and directors, officers, employees, subsidiaries, controlling persons, agents
and representatives of Sellers and their Affiliates.

  

  

(ii) Except to the extent provided in Section 10.13 (Specific Performance),
from and after Closing, the rights expressly provided for in this ARTICLE IX
shall be the exclusive remedies of the Parties and their respective officers,
directors, employees, Affiliates, agents, representatives, successors and
assigns for any breach or inaccuracy of any warranty or breach of or
noncompliance with any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and
the Parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement or to any
further indemnification or other rights or claims of any nature whatsoever
(including under statute, regulation, common law, in equity or for negligence)
in respect thereof, all of which the Parties hereto hereby waive to the
fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that neither this Section
9.3 nor Section 9.1 shall limit the rights of any Purchaser Indemnitee for
Losses in the event and to the extent of any fraud by any Seller in connection
with this Agreement. For purposes of this subsection, the term "fraud" when
used with respect to any particular Seller shall mean any common law fraud or
any fraudulent or intentional breach of, or active concealment with respect
to, any representations or warranties made by such Seller in this Agreement
(but expressly not with respect to any representation or warranty of any other
Seller or the Company unless said

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 53 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Seller had knowledge of or active participation in such other Seller's or the
Company's fraud, fraudulent or intentional breach, or active concealment).

  

  

Section 9.4 Tax Indemnity. Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and
hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees and hold them harmless from any and
all Losses in respect of:

  

  

(a) any and all liability for Taxes with respect to any taxable period of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (or any predecessors) for all
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and with respect to any
taxable period that begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date, for
the portion thereof ending on the Closing Date;

  

  

(b) any and all liability for Taxes of Sellers or any other Person (other than
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) which is or has ever been
affiliated with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or with whom
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries otherwise joins or has ever
joined (or is or has ever been required to join) in filing any consolidated,
combined, unitary or aggregate Tax Return, prior to the Closing Date;

  

  

(c) any breach of (i) any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.6
(Taxes), and (ii) any covenant or agreement set forth in Section 6.5(k)
(Conduct Prior to Closing) and Section 6.11 (Tax Matters);

  

  

(d) any and all liability for Taxes imposed pursuant to Circular 698 in
connection with the Transaction;

  

  

(e) any and all liability for Taxes resulting from any transactions set forth
on Schedule 6.5(l) of the Disclosure Schedules; and

  

  

(f) any payments required to be made after the Closing Date under any Tax
sharing, Tax indemnity, Tax allocation or similar Contracts (whether or not
written) to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries was
obligated, or was a party, on or prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to
Taxes, this Section 9.4 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Parties and Section 9.2(a) shall not apply to any claims for Taxes made
pursuant to this Section 9.4.

  

  

Section 9.5 Purchase Price Adjustment. The Parties agree that any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

such assignment shall otherwise vary or diminish any of Purchaser's

Section 10.9 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Save as provided in Section 6.14 and
ARTICLE IX, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their
successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein express or implied shall
give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the Parties and such

Section 10.10 Immunity. To the extent that Purchaser may in any jurisdiction
claim for itself or its assets or revenues immunity from suit, execution,
attachment (whether in aid of execution, before the making of a judgment or
otherwise) or other legal process and to the extent that such immunity
(whether or not claimed) may be attributed in any such jurisdiction to

irrevocably waives such immunity to the full extent permitted by the laws of
such jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 10.11 Right of Set-Off. Each Party hereto, for itself and its
successors and permitted assigns, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment, or similar rights

with respect to the payment of the Estimated Purchase Price or any Adjustment
Amount (in the case of Purchaser) or any other payments to be made by such

Company should fail to perform under any of the provisions of this Agreement
in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach any of the
provisions of this Agreement, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate
remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and
that Purchaser shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity. Seller and the Company
hereby waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. In no event
shall Sellers, the Seller Representative or the Company be entitled to seek
specific performance with respect to any of Purchaser's obligations arising
under this Agreement.

any other provision hereof.

  

  

Section 10.15 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed, shall be

Section 10.16 Seller Representative

of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of such Seller with

such Seller's name to Purchaser, in accordance with the terms and provisions
of this Agreement and to act on behalf of such Seller in any amendment of or
litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement and to do or refrain from
doing all such further acts and things, including in connection with any
indemnification matters pursuant to ARTICLE IX, and to execute all such
documents, as such Seller Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate
in conjunction with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the power:

  

  

(i) to take all action necessary or desirable in connection with the waiver of
any condition to the obligations of Sellers to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

(ii) to negotiate, execute and deliver all ancillary agreements, certificates,
statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers, undertakings, amendments
and other documents required or permitted to be given in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being
understood that such Seller shall execute and deliver any such documents which
the Seller Representative agrees to execute);

  

  

(iii) to terminate this Agreement if Sellers are entitled to do so in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement;

  

  

(iv) to give and receive all notices and communications to be given or
received by such Seller under this Agreement and to receive service of process
on behalf of such Seller in connection with any claims under this Agreement,
including service of process in connection with arbitration;

  

  

(v) to take all actions under this Agreement which may be taken by such Seller
and to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of such
Seller which the Seller Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its
sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement as fully and

\- 59 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

  

(vi) to act for such Seller with respect to all indemnification matters
referred to in this Agreement, including the right to compromise on behalf of
such Seller any indemnification claim by or against such Seller.

  

  

(b) Provided that the Seller Representative uses commercially reasonable
efforts to distribute all amounts received by it hereunder to Sellers in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Seller
Representative will not be liable for any act taken or omitted by it as
permitted under this Agreement, except if such act is taken or omitted in bad
faith or by willful breach or gross negligence. The Seller Representative will
also be fully protected in relying upon any written notice, demand,
certificate or document that it in good faith believes to be genuine
(including facsimiles thereof). In no event shall Purchaser or the Company or
any of their Affiliates, have any liability to any Seller for any action taken
or omission to act by the Seller Representative.

  

  

(c) Sellers agree, severally but not jointly, to indemnify (on a pro rata
basis based upon such Seller's Proportional Share) the Seller Representative
for, and to hold the Seller Representative harmless against, any loss,
liability or expense incurred without willful breach, gross negligence or bad
faith on the part of the Seller Representative, arising out of or in
connection with the Seller Representative's carrying out its duties under this
Agreement, including costs and expenses of successfully defending the Seller
Representative against any claim of liability with respect thereto. The Seller
Representative may consult with counsel of its own choice and will have full
and complete authorization and protection for any action taken and suffered by
it in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel. The
Seller Representative shall not be entitled to any fees, commissions or other
compensation for acting as the Seller Representative.

  

  

(d) If the Original Seller Representative resigns in writing as Seller
Representative or otherwise becomes unable to serve as Seller Representative,
a majority of Sellers may designate as a successor Seller Representative any
other Person with the prior written consent of Purchaser (the "Successor
Seller Representative"). If for any reason no Successor Seller Representative
has been appointed within thirty (30) days of such resignation or inability to
serve by the Original Seller Representative, then any Seller or Purchaser
shall have the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction for
appointment of a Successor Seller Representative. Upon written acceptance by
such Successor Seller Representative to serve as Seller Representative, such
Successor Seller Representative shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all of the powers and duties and obligations of the Original Seller
Representative without further act. Notwithstanding any replacement of the
Original Seller Representative hereunder, the provisions of this Section 10.16
shall continue in effect for the benefit of the Original Stockholder
Representative with respect to all actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while acting as Stockholder Representative.

  

  

(e) Purchaser shall have the right to rely upon all actions taken or omitted
to be taken by the Seller Representative pursuant to this Agreement, all of

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 60 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

which actions and omissions shall be legally binding upon Sellers. No party
hereunder shall have any cause of action against Purchaser to the extent
Purchaser has relied upon decisions and actions of the Seller Representative.

  

  

(f) The grant of authority to the Seller Representative provided for in this
Section 10.16, (i) is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and
survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any of Sellers,
and (ii) shall survive the Closing.

  

  

(g) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Seller
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or
termination of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 10.17 Waiver and Termination of Existing Shareholders Agreement. Each
Seller waives any right he or it may have under the existing memorandum and
articles of association of the Company and any shareholders agreement dated
(the "Existing Shareholders Agreement") with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each Seller agrees that simultaneous with the
Closing the Existing Shareholders Agreement shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect.
