   ARTICLE 2 
  MERGER CONSIDERATION; THE MERGER

 

  Section 2.01. _Unadjusted Merger Consideration_. The unadjusted
aggregate consideration in respect of the Merger (the "Unadjusted Merger
Consideration") shall be $116,244,000 plus the Converted Note Principal Amount
and shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.02.

 

  Section 2.02. _Determination of Adjusted Merger Consideration_. (a) No
later than 7 days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will cause to be
prepared and delivered to Parent a good faith estimate of the Closing Balance
Sheet and a good faith estimate of Closing Working Capital. The Companys
estimate of Closing Working Capital shall (i) accurately reflect the Working
Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date, (ii) be based upon balance
sheet line items and accounts of the Company calculated in accordance with
GAAP applied consistently with respect to the accounting policies, practices
and procedures used in the preparation of the Company Balance Sheet and (iii)
otherwise be prepared in accordance with this Agreement.

 

  (b) If Parent disagrees in good faith with any item within the
Companys estimate of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to
Section 2.02(a), Parent may, within 3 days after delivery of the documents
referred to in Section 2.02(a), deliver a notice to the Company setting forth,
in reasonable detail and to the extent practicable, each item or amount so
disputed by Parent, Parents calculation of such item or amount and Parents
good faith estimate of Closing Working Capital. Upon delivery of any such
notice, Parent shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
set forth in the estimate of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to
Section 2.02(a) that are not specifically the subject of dispute in any notice
delivered by Parent as provided above.

 

  (c) If Parent disagrees in good faith with the Companys estimate of
Closing Working Capital, Parent and the Company shall, during the time
between the delivery of such estimate and the Closing Date, use commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine the Adjusted Merger Consideration. If, during such period,
Parent and the Company are unable to reach such agreement, then the Adjusted
Merger Consideration shall be determined based upon the Companys good faith
estimate of Closing Working Capital as provided in Section 2.02(d) and Section
2.02(e) and the Escrow Amount shall include the difference between Adjusted
Merger Consideration as calculated based on the Companys estimate of Closing
Working Capital and Adjusted Merger Consideration as calculated based on
Parents estimate of Closing Working Capital (the "Disputed Amount");
provided, however, that in no event shall the Disputed Amount exceed
$5,000,000.

 

  (d) Following the delivery of the Companys estimate of Closing Working
Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.02(a), "Final Working Capital" shall
mean (i) Closing Working Capital as shown in the Companys calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 2.02(a), if no notice of dispute with respect
thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.02(b) or (ii) if a notice of
dispute is duly delivered pursuant to and in

 

11    
  

 accordance with Section 2.02(b), the amount agreed as between Parent and the
Company pursuant to Section 2.02(c), if so agreed, or in the absence of such
agreement, the Companys good faith estimate of Closing Working Capital.

 

  (e) Following the determination of Final Working Capital, the
"Adjusted Merger Consideration" shall be calculated as the Unadjusted Merger
Consideration (i) less the amount by which Target Working Capital exceeds
Final Working Capital, if Target Working Capital is greater than Final
Working Capital (it being understood and agreed that if Target Working Capital
is less than Final Working Capital there shall be no corresponding adjustment
to the Unadjusted Merger Consideration) and (ii) less any Additional Cash
Expenses.

 

  Section 2.03. _Final Merger Consideration; Form Thereof_. The
consideration to be received by holders of Company Stock pursuant to
this Agreement (the "Final Merger Consideration") shall be determined as
follows:

 

  (a) If the Average Pre-Closing Parent Stock Price is greater than the
Average Pre-Signing Parent Stock Price multiplied by 1.3, then the Company
may elect for the Final Merger Consideration to consist of an amount of cash
equal to the Adjusted Merger Consideration. In order to so elect, the Company
must provide Parent with written notice of its election pursuant to this
Section 2.03(a) no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date.
In the event that the Company does not so elect as provided in the preceding
sentence, then Final Merger Consideration shall consist of the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock determined by dividing (i) the Adjusted Merger
Consideration by (ii) the Average Pre-Closing Parent Stock Price.

 

  (b) If the Average Pre-Closing Parent Stock Price is greater than or
equal to the Average Pre-Signing Parent Stock Price but less than or equal to
the Average Pre-Signing Parent Stock Price multiplied by 1.3, then the Final
Merger Consideration shall consist of the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock determined by dividing (i) the Adjusted Merger Consideration by (ii) the
Average Pre-Closing Parent Stock Price.

 

  (c) If the Average Pre-Closing Parent Stock Price is less than the
Average Pre-Signing Parent Stock Price but greater than or equal to
the Average Pre-Signing Parent Stock Price multiplied by 0.7, then the Final
Merger Consideration shall consist of:

>>  

>>

>>   (A) The amount determined by multiplying (x) the Adjusted Merger
Consideration by (y) one minus the amount determined by dividing the
Average Pre-Closing Parent Stock Price by the Average Pre-Signing Parent
Stock Price; and

>>

>>  

>>

>>   (B) The maximum amount of cash that (1) in the reasonable judgment
of Parents counsel, will allow Parents counsel to render the tax opinion
referred to in Section 9.02(f) and (2) in the reasonable

render the tax opinion referred to in Section 9.03(c); and

>>

>>  

>

>
>  

 

  (d) If the Average Pre-Closing Parent Stock Price is less than the
Average Pre-Signing Parent Stock Price multiplied by 0.7, then the
Final Merger Consideration shall consist of an amount of cash equal to the
Adjusted Merger Consideration.

 

  In each case in which the Final Merger Consideration includes shares of
Parent Common Stock, the Final Merger Consideration shall include any cash
delivered in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.10.

 

  Section 2.04. _The Merger_. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger
Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance
with California Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary
shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation").

 

  (b) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the Company
and Merger Subsidiary will file an agreement of merger in customary form with
the Secretary of State of the State of California and make all other filings
or recordings required by California Law in connection with the Merger.
Immediately prior to the filing of the agreement of merger, a closing (the
"Closing") will be held at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 1600 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park, California 94025 (or such other place as the parties
may agree). The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective
Time") as the agreement of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of California or at such later time as is specified in the
agreement of merger.

 

  (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effect
set forth under California Law, and without limiting the foregoing, from and
after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed without transfer to
all rights and properties of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, and shall be
subject to the debts and liabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary as
if the Surviving Corporation had incurred such debts and liabilities, all as
provided under California Law.

 

  Section 2.05. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time:

 

  (a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.05(b), each share of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shares of Company Preferred
Stock shall be deemed to have converted into Company Common Stock pursuant to
Article IV.3(c) of the Companys articles of incorporation) shall be converted
into the right to receive (i) the number of

 

13    
  

 shares of Parent Stock, if any, equal to the Stock Exchange Ratio and (ii)
an amount of cash, if any, equal to the Cash Exchange Ratio;

 

  (b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock
or owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto; and

 

  (c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

  (d) if any shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with the Company, then, at Parents option and in
Parents sole discretion, the Final Merger Consideration in respect of
such shares shall either be (i) paid to the holder thereof, in the manner
provided in Section 2.06, without restriction or (ii) paid to the holder
thereof over time upon satisfaction of the vesting requirements associated
with the applicable restricted stock schedule.

 

  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that
the Escrow Amount shall be deducted from the Final Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Company Stock pursuant to this Article 2, and shall
only be payable (x) upon release from the Escrow Account in accordance with
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and (y) to the extent not reduced by
indemnification payments pursuant to Article 10.

 

  Section 2.06. _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Parent will appoint an
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
certificates representing the shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") for
the Final Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company
Stock evidenced by each such Certificate (less the Escrow Holdback).
Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent will make available the Final
Merger Consideration (less the Escrow Amount) to be paid in respect of the
Certificates.

 

  (b) Each holder of outstanding Company Stock that has been converted
into the right to receive the Final Merger Consideration will be entitled to
receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with
a properly completed letter of transmittal (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificate to the Exchange Agent), the Final Merger
Consideration less the Escrow Holdback issuable and/or payable for each share
of Company Stock represented by such Certificate. Until so surrendered, from
and after the Effective Time each such Certificate shall represent for all
purposes only the right to receive such Final Merger Consideration.

 

14    
  

  (c) If any portion of the Final Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

  (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Final Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

 

  (e) Any portion of the Final Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.06(a) (and any interest or other income
earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company
Stock ninety (90) Business Days after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Company Stock for the Final Merger Consideration issuable and/or payable in
respect of such shares of Company Stock (less the Escrow Holdback applicable
thereto) in accordance with this Section 2.06 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Final Merger Consideration
issuable and/or payable in respect of such shares of Company Stock without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to
any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Immediately prior to such time when amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company Stock would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
governmental authority, such unclaimed amounts shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Persons previously entitled thereto.

 

  (f) Any portion of the Final Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.06(a) to pay for shares of Company Stock
for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent,
upon demand.

 

  Section 2.07. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.05, shares
of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with
California Law shall not be converted into a right to receive the Final
Merger Consideration issuable and/or payable in respect of such shares of
Company Stock, but the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as
are provided by California Law, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws
or otherwise loses its right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, such
shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into a right to receive the Final Merger Consideration issuable and/or
payable in respect of such shares of Company Stock less the Escrow Holdback
applicable thereto. The Company shall give Parent

 

15    
  

 prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 

  Section 2.08. _Stock Options_. (a) All Company Employee Stock Options
and Supplemental Options shall, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by
Parent. Each Company Employee Stock Option and Supplemental Option so assumed
by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to,
substantially similar terms and conditions to those set forth in the Company
Stock Option Plan or as provided in the respective option agreement
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including the vesting schedule),
except that (i) each Company Employee Stock Option and Supplemental Option
will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issuable upon exercise of such Company Employee Stock Option or
Supplemental Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B)
the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares
of Parent Common Stock; and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company
Employee Stock Option or Supplemental Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock at which such Company Employee Stock Option or Supplemental Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Option Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. It is the intention of the
parties hereto that the Company Employee Stock Options and Supplemental
Options assumed by Parent following the Effective Time pursuant to this
Section will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, qualify as incentive
stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code, to the extent any such
Company Employee Stock Options or Supplemental Options qualified as incentive
stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

  (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to each holder of an outstanding Company Employee Stock Option
or Supplemental Option an appropriate notice setting forth such holders
rights pursuant thereto. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of assumed Company Employee
Stock Options and Supplemental Options pursuant to the terms set forth in this
Section.

 

  (c) At the Effective Time, all Company Stock Options that are not
Company Employee Stock Options shall accelerate in accordance with
their terms and, to the extent not exercised, terminate in accordance with
their terms. The Company shall provide notice to holders of such Company Stock
Options in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Option Plan.

 

16    
  

  Section 2.09. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of Company Stock or Parent Common Stock shall occur, including by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of shares of Company Stock or Parent Common Stock, or stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Final Merger
Consideration, the Escrow Holdback, and any other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement shall, to the extent necessary, be appropriately adjusted.

 

  Section 2.10. _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Stock
shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock that a
holder of shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to
receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional
share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive,
in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying
the Average Pre-Closing Parent Stock Price by the fraction of a share of
Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.

 

  Section 2.11. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of
which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

 

  Section 2.12. _Escrow._ At the Effective Time, Parent shall withhold
from the Final Merger Consideration otherwise issuable and/or payable
in connection with the Merger an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock and/or an aggregate amount of cash equal to the Escrow Amount, in the
same relative proportions as the proportions of Parent Common Stock and cash
that comprise the Final Merger Consideration. Prior to or simultaneously with
the Effective Time, the Shareholders Representative and Parent shall enter
into an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") with an escrow agent
selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Shareholders
Representative (the "Escrow Agent") in the form of Exhibit C hereto. Pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, at the Effective Time Parent shall
deposit the Escrow Amount into an escrow account, which account is to be
managed by the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Account"). Distributions of any
shares of Parent Common Stock and/or cash from the Escrow Account shall be
governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement (the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash, if any, in the Escrow
Account being referred to as the "Escrow Fund"). The Escrow Amount shall be
withheld from, and allocated to, each holder of Company Stock based on such
holders Escrow Holdback. All distributions from the Escrow Fund shall be made
in shares of Parent Common Stock and/or cash in the same relative proportions
as originally included in the Escrow Amount.

 

17    
  

  Section 2.13. _Resolution of Disputed Amount_. (a) In the event that
any Disputed Amount is included in the Escrow Amount, Parent and the
Shareholders Representative shall, during the 15 days following the Closing
Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
items or amounts. If Parent and the Shareholders Representative are unable
to reach agreement during such period, they shall promptly thereafter cause
independent accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Shareholders Representative (who shall not
have any material relationship  with Parent, the Company, the Shareholders
Representative or any of their  respective Affiliates) (the "Independent
Accountants"),  promptly to review the disputed items or amounts for the
purpose of calculating  Closing Working Capital (the "Independent 
Accountants Working Capital"). In calculating  Independent  Accountant
Working Capital, such Independent Accountants shall consider only those items
or amounts in the calculation of Closing Working Capital as to which Parent
has disagreed pursuant to and in accordance with Section  2.02(b) . Such
Independent Accountants shall deliver to Parent and the Shareholders
Representative,  as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 30 days
following receipt  of all information requested from the Company to calculate
Closing Working  Capital), a report that explains any discrepancies between
such Independent  Accountants Working Capital and Final Working Capital and
sets forth the  Independent Accountants calculation of Independent
Accountants Working Capital. Such report and the calculations set forth
therein shall be final and binding upon Parent, the Shareholders
Representative and their respective Affiliates and shall not be subject to
challenge by any of the foregoing in a court of law or otherwise. The cost of
such review and report shall be paid from the Escrow Fund if Independent
Accountants Working Capital is closer to Parents calculation of Closing
Working Capital than the Companys estimate of Closing Working Capital.

 

  (b) As promptly as practicable following the delivery of the
Independent Accountants report specified above, each of Parent and
the Shareholders Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to make
distributions from the Escrow Fund, and the Escrow Agent shall make such
distributions, as follows:

 

>  
>
>   (i) If Independent Accountants Working Capital is less than Final
> Working Capital, then the Escrow Agent shall distribute from the
> Escrow Fund (A) to Parent, an amount equal to (1) the amount of the
> difference between the Adjusted Merger Consideration as actually determined
> pursuant to Section 2.02(e) above and the Adjusted Merger Consideration that
> would have resulted had such amount been calculated using Independent
> Accountants Working Capital in lieu of Final Working Capital plus (2) the
> cost of the Independent Accountants review and report pursuant to Section
> 2.13(a) and (B) to the former shareholders of the Company (in proportion to
> each such shareholders Escrow Holdback), the balance, if any, of the
> Disputed Amount that remains in the Escrow Fund following the distributions
> specified in clause (A) of this Section 2.13(b)(i); and
>
>  
>
>   (ii) (A) If Independent Accountants Working Capital is greater than
> or equal to Final Working Capital, then the Escrow Agent shall distribute
> the Disputed Amount from the Escrow Fund to the former shareholders of the
>
>  

 

18   
 

>  
>
>  Company (in proportion to each such shareholders Escrow Holdback) and (B)
> in the event that Independent Accountants Working Capital is greater than
> Final Working Capital, Parent shall issue and/or pay to the
> former shareholders of the Company (in proportion to each such
> shareholders Escrow Holdback), the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
> and/or cash not already included in the Disputed Amount that would have been
> issued and/or paid to such former shareholders if the Independent
> Accountants Working Capital had been the Final Working Capital at the
> Closing; _provided_ , however, that in no event shall the amounts
> distributed to the former shareholders of the Company pursuant to this
> Section 2.13(b)(ii), when aggregated with the Final Merger Consideration,
> exceed the Unadjusted Merger Consideration.
>
>  

 

 For purposes of calculating the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be included in a distribution of a given amount pursuant to this Section
2.13(b), Parent Common Stock shall be ascribed the same value given to it
in connection with the calculation of Final Merger Consideration.

 

  Section 2.14. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the entry by such Person into an
indemnification agreement in form satisfactory to Parent, or the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Final Merger Consideration
issuable and/or payable in respect of the shares of Company Stock evidenced by
such Certificate (less the Escrow Holdback applicable thereto), as
contemplated by this Article 2.

equitable principles (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and

on the Company or (iv) result in the

 

21   
  

 creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company, except for
such Liens referred to in clause (iv) as would not be reasonably expected to
be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company or to

the date of this Agreement and to the Knowledge of the Company, no other
party to any Material Contract is in default or breach or has failed to
fulfill its obligations in any material respect under the terms of any

contract, plan, arrangement or policy and each other plan or arrangement
(written or oral) providing for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock
option or other stock related rights or other forms of incentive or deferred
compensation, vacation benefits, health or medical benefits, employee
assistance program, disability or sick leave benefits, severance benefits and
post-employment or retirement benefits (including compensation, pension,
health, medical or life insurance benefits) which is maintained, administered
or contributed to by the Company or any of its Affiliates and covers any
current or former employee, director or independent contractor of the
Company, or with respect to which the Company has any liability. Copies of
such plans (and, if applicable, related trust or funding agreements or
insurance policies) and all amendments thereto and written interpretations
thereof have been made available to Parent together with the most recent
annual report (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto)

under applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations or Internal
Revenue Service pronouncements in which to apply for such a letter and to
make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination as to the
qualified status of each such Employee Plan. To the Companys Knowledge, no
such determination, opinion or advisory letter has been revoked and
revocation has not been threatened, and no such Employee Plan has been
amended or operated since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred,

  (e) Each Employee Plan has been maintained in material compliance with
its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including but not limited to ERISA
and the Code, which are applicable to such Employee Plan. To the Knowledge of

will not (either alone or together with any other event) entitle any current
or former employee, director or independent contractor of the Company to
severance pay, bonus, retirement or similar benefit or accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or trigger any payment of funding (through a grantor trust
or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable
or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Employee Plan or any
other employment or benefit arrangement.

 

  (g) There is no contract, plan or arrangement (written or otherwise)

  (j) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its

negotiating in connection with entering into, any collective

employment terminations, with respect to its employees.

 

  (o) The Company has provided to Parent a true and complete list of the

ARTICLE 7 
  COVENANTS OF PARENT

 

 

 Parent agrees that:

  

  Section 7.01 _. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary._ Parent will take all
action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

 

  Section 7.02 _. Benefits; Prior Service._ From and after the Effective
Time, the Companys employees who continue employment with Parent or its
Subsidiaries shall be

 

49   
  

 provided with employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are substantially
comparable to those provided to employees of Parent who are similarly
situated. Parent shall cause such employees of the Company to be credited with
service with the Company for purposes of eligibility and vesting under each
employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time (and, for vacation and severance plans, for purposes of benefit
accrual) to the extent of their service with the Company. To the extent
permitted by the terms of Parents plans, Parent shall cause any and all pre-
existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any group health plans to be waived with
respect to such Company employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent
such limitations, waiting periods or evidence would not have applied under the
Company plan, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide them
with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar
payments) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any
employee benefit plans of Parent in which they are eligible to participate
after the Effective Time.

 

  Section 7.03 _. Indemnification._ (a) __ From and after the Effective
Time, Parent will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of Company (or any predecessor

and any of its current or former directors or officers (the "Indemnified
Parties") and (ii) any indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses
provision under the Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws as in
effect on the date hereof. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to
the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Companys articles of
incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years
from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnified Party or of individuals who, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, were employees or agents of Company, unless such
modification is required by law.

 

  (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a six-year
prepaid "tail" extension of the Companys directors and officers and
fiduciary liability insurance (the "Tail DandO Policy") on terms and conditions
that are no more advantageous to the beneficiaries of such policy than
the Companys existing directors and officers and fiduciary liability
insurance. In the event that the Company purchases such a Tail DandO Policy,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such Tail DandO Policy in
full force and effect and shall honor their respective obligations thereunder
for a period of six years after the Effective Time.

 

  (c) The provisions of this Section shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries
under the Tail DandO Policy (and their heirs and representatives) and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Indemnified Party (and other persons who are
beneficiaries under the Tail DandO Policy (and their heirs and

 

50   
  

 representatives)) may have by contract or otherwise under the articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company, or
applicable law or equity. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 7.03 shall not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party (or other person who is a beneficiary under the Tail DandO Policy (or
their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Party (or other person who is a beneficiary under the
Tail DandO Policy (or their heirs and representatives)). Each of the
Indemnified Parties is intended to be a third party beneficiary of this
Section 7.03, with full rights of enforcement as if a party hereto.

 

  (d) The obligations and liability of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 7.03 shall be joint and several
without limitation.

 

  (e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of
their respective successors or assigns) shall consolidate or merge with any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger, or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any other person, then and in each case
proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable), or
transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.03.

 

  Section 7.04 _. Listing Notifications._ Parent shall timely prepare and
submit to Nasdaq any notice or other document or instrument required to be
filed with or submitted to Nasdaq with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger prior to the Effective Time.

 

  Section 7.05 _. Form S-8._ Parent agrees to file with the SEC as soon
as possible following the Effective Time, and in any event within 5 Business
Days following the Effective Time, and to use commercially reasonable efforts
to maintain the effectiveness of, a registration statement on Form S-8 under
the Securities Act covering, to the extent applicable, the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of Company Stock Options and
Supplemental Options of the Company assumed by Parent.

 ARTICLE 10 
  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION

 

  Section 10.01 _. Survival of Representation and Warranties._ The
Companys representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Effective Time until 11:59 P.M. (California time) on the
date that is one year after the Effective Time (the "Expiration Date"). If
written notice of a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.02(c)
has been given prior to the Expiration Date by the party seeking
indemnification to the party from whom indemnification is sought, then the
relevant representations and warranties shall survive as to such claim until
such claim has been finally resolved. All of Parents and Merger Subsidiarys
representations and warranties contained herein or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time. 

 

  Section 10.02 _. Indemnification._ (a) Subject to Section 10.02(e),
Parent and its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation), officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Parent Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the shareholders of the Company, severally but not jointly,
solely out of the Escrow Fund for any and all damage, losses, liability,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (including reasonable
expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and
expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding whether involving a
third party claim or a claim solely between the parties hereto (collectively,
"Damages"), incurred or suffered by any Parent Indemnified Party arising out
of (i) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty (without giving effect to
any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained
therein in determining the amount of any Damages, but taking account of such
qualifications for purposes of determining whether there has been or occurred
a misrepresentation or breach of warranty) or breach of covenant or agreement
made or to be performed by the Company contained in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered by the Company in connection with this Agreement or (ii)
the matter described in Schedule 10.02(a) . All fees, expenses and other
Damages of the Parent Indemnified Parties in connection with any matter for
which indemnity is sought shall be reimbursed solely from the Escrow Account
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. For purposes of determining the
amounts payable from the Escrow Fund in connection with any claims for
Damages by a Parent Indemnified Party, shares of Parent Common Stock held in
the Escrow Fund shall be ascribed the same value give to such shares in
connection with the calculation of Final Merger Consideration.

 

58    
  

  (b) The aggregate amount of Damages for which the Parent Indemnified
Parties may receive indemnification pursuant to this Article 10 shall
not exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount. In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) the maximum amount
of Damages that the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover
from the Escrow Fund for any indemnification claims under this Article 10
other than those that could be brought as claims for a misrepresentation or
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.28
(irrespective of whether such claims under Section 4.28 could be brought as
claims for a misrepresentation or breach of any of the Companys other
representations and warranties in this Agreement) or that arise out of the
agreements (or the course of dealing contemplated thereunder) and
other transactions referred to in Section 4.28 shall be equal to 7.5% of the
Final Merger Consideration and (ii) the maximum amount of Damages that the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund
for any indemnification claims under this Article 10 that could be brought as
claims for a misrepresentation or breach of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 4.28 (irrespective of whether such claims under Section
4.28 could be brought as claims for a misrepresentation or breach of any of
the Companys other representations and warranties in this Agreement) or that
arise out of the agreements (or the course of dealing contemplated thereunder)
and other transactions referred to in Section 4.28 shall be equal to 3.72% of
the Final Merger Consideration.

 

  (c) Any Parent Indemnified Party seeking indemnification from another
party hereto (the "Indemnifying Party") under this Section 10.02 shall give
the Escrow Agent and the Shareholders Representative notice of any matter
that such Parent Indemnified Party has determined has given rise to a right
of indemnification under this Agreement, prior to the Expiration Date,
stating in reasonable detail and to the extent available the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such claim, the amount of Damages, if known, and
method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the specific
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises.

 

  (d) If (x) the Shareholders Representative shall not have objected to
the amount claimed by the Parent Indemnified Party for indemnification from
the Escrow Fund with respect to any Damages in accordance with the procedures
set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement or (y) the Shareholders
Representative shall have delivered notice of its disagreement as to
the amount of any indemnification requested by the Parent Indemnified Party
from the Escrow Fund and either (i) the Shareholders Representative and the
Parent Indemnified Party shall have, subsequent to the giving of such notice,
mutually agreed that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification from the Escrow Fund for a specified amount and shall have so
jointly notified the Escrow Agent or (ii) a final judgment shall have been
rendered by the court having jurisdiction over the matters relating to such
claim by the Parent Indemnified Party for indemnification from the Escrow
Fund, and the Escrow Agent shall have received, in the case of clause (i)
above, joint written instructions from the Shareholders Representative and
the Parent Indemnified Party or, in the case of clause (ii) above, a copy of
the final judgment of the court and written instructions from the Parent
Indemnified Party, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Parent
Indemnified Party funds

 

59    
  

 from the Escrow Fund in respect of any amount determined to be owed to the
Parent Indemnified Party under this Section in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

 

  (e) Except as provided in Section 10.02(j), the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to recover under this Section 10.02
with respect to any misrepresentation or breach of representations and
warranties, unless the aggregate amount of Damages arising out of all such
misrepresentations or breaches of representations and warranties exceeds
$500,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only to extent of such excess;
_provided_ that any Damages arising out of (i) the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 4.27 and 4.28 and (ii) the matter described
in Schedule 10.02(a) shall in each case not be subject to the Deductible (and
shall not be considered for purposes of determining whether Damages arising
out of any other representations and warranties exceed the Deductible) and
shall be recoverable from the first dollar.

 

  (f) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Section 10.02
for incidental, indirect or consequential Damages, or any lost profits or
diminution in value.

 

  (g) The amount of any Damages payable under this Section 10.02 to any
Parent Indemnified Party shall be reduced by any amounts actually recovered
by such Parent Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies, net of
(i) any expenses incurred by such Parent Indemnified Party in collecting such
amount and (ii) the present value of any increase in applicable insurance
premiums that such Parent Indemnified Party reasonably expects to incur as a
result of the claim or claims that resulted in such recovery (the "Premium
Offset"). If any Parent Indemnified Party receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party, then such Parent Indemnifying Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by
such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing the indemnification
payment up to the amount received by the Parent Indemnified Party, net of (i)
any expenses incurred by such Parent Indemnified Party in collecting such
amount and (ii) any Premium Offset. Each Parent Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under
insurance coverage for any Damages payable under this Section 10.02.

 

  (h) In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim that
Parent believes may result in an indemnification claim against the
Escrow Fund by or on behalf of an Parent Indemnified Party, Parent shall
promptly notify the Shareholders Representative of such third-party claim.
Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of
and to settle any such claim and the costs and expenses incurred by Parent in
connection with such defense or settlement shall be included in the Damages
for which any Parent Indemnified Party may seek indemnification pursuant to a
claim made hereunder. The Shareholders Representative shall have the right
to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to
the third-party claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not
affect any privilege relating to any Parent Indemnified Party and shall be
entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct,
any defense of the third-party claim or settlement negotiations with respect
to the third-party claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, except with the consent of the Shareholders Representative, no
settlement of any

 

60    
  

 such claim with any third-party claimant shall in and of itself be
determinative of the existence of any right to indemnification hereunder or
the existence or amount of Damages relating to such matter. In the event that
the Shareholders Representative has consented to any such settlement,
neither the Shareholders Representative nor any former shareholders of the
Company shall be entitled to object under any other provision of this Article
10 to the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Parent Indemnified Party
against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement.

 

  (i) The representations and warranties (as modified by the Company
Disclosure Schedule) and the covenants and agreements of the Company, and the
rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Parent Indemnified Parties,
shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of any
information furnished to, or any investigation made by or Knowledge of, and
Parent Indemnified Party.

 

  (j) The indemnification provided by this Article shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Subsidiary after
the Effective Time for any claim related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except with respect to claims arising out of
fraud, criminal activity or the willful breach of covenants by a party hereto,
which shall not be subject to the Deductible and shall be recoverable from
the first dollar.

 

  Section 10.03 _. Shareholders  Representative. _(a) Effective upon and
by virtue of the vote of the holders of Company Stock approving and adopting
this Agreement and the Merger, and without any further act of any of the
holders of the Company Stock, the Shareholders Representative shall be hereby
appointed as the representative of the holders of Company Stock and as
the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of each holder of Company
Stock solely with respect to (i) any claims by any Parent Indemnified Party
against the Escrow Fund under Articles 2 and 10 of this Agreement and (ii) any
amendments to the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
amendment of the Escrow Agreement that shall adversely affect the rights
or obligations of any shareholder under the Escrow Agreement (other than any
change affecting all holders of Company Stock similarly) shall require the
prior written consent of such adversely affected shareholder. The
Shareholders Representative hereby accepts such appointment. The
Shareholders Representative shall have the authority to take any and all
actions and make any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the
Shareholders Representative under the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement,
including the exercise of the power to (i) agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, commence any suit, action or proceeding, and
comply with orders of courts with respect to, claims by any
Parent Indemnified Party against the Escrow Fund under Articles 2 and 10 of
this Agreement, (ii) litigate, resolve, settle or compromise any dispute that
may arise pursuant to Section 5 of the Escrow Agreement, and (iii) take all
actions necessary in the judgment of the Shareholders Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. The Shareholders Representative will have
sole authority and power to act on behalf of each former shareholder of the
Company with respect to the disposition, settlement or other handling of all
claims against the Escrow Fund under this Agreement and all related rights or
obligations of the former shareholders of the Company arising under this
Agreement. The Shareholders Representative will also have sole authority and
power to

 

 61   
  

 act on behalf of each former shareholder of the Company with respect to any
amendments to the Escrow Agreement. The Shareholders Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, based on contact information available to
the Shareholders Representative, to keep the former shareholders of the
Company reasonably informed with respect to actions of the Shareholders
Representative pursuant to the authority granted the
Shareholders Representative under this Agreement. Each former shareholder of
the Company shall promptly provide written notice to the Shareholders
Representative of any change of address of such shareholder.

 

  (b) In all matters relating to the disposition, settlement or other
handling of claims against the Escrow Fund under this Agreement or
any amendments to the Escrow Agreement, the Shareholders Representative (or
his or her successor) shall be the only party entitled to assert the rights of
the former shareholders of the Company. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholders Representative hereunder shall constitute a
decision, act, consent or instruction of all former holders of Company Stock
and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of such shareholders, and
the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholders Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each and every such holder of Company Stock. The
Escrow Agent and Parent shall be relieved from any liability to any Person
for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholders Representative.

 

  (c) The Shareholders Representative shall have the right to recover
from the Escrow Fund, prior to any distribution to the holders of Company
Stock (but after any disbursement from the Escrow Fund to the Escrow Agent
pursuant to terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement), the Shareholders
Representatives reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in serving in
that capacity (the "Shareholders Representatives Expenses"). In the event
the Escrow Property is insufficient to satisfy the Shareholders
Representatives Expenses, then each holder of Company Stock will be
obligated to pay a percentage of the Shareholders Representatives Expenses
in excess of the Escrow Fund proportionate to that holders Escrow Holdback.

 

  (d) The Shareholders Representative will incur no liability with
respect to any action taken or suffered by any party in reliance upon any
notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed
by such Shareholders Representative to be genuine and to have been signed by
the proper person (and shall have no responsibility to determine the
authenticity thereof), nor for any other action or inaction, except his own
gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. In all questions arising
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Shareholders Representative
may rely on the advice of outside counsel, and the Shareholders
Representative will not be liable to anyone for anything done, omitted or
suffered in good faith by the Shareholders Representative based on such
advice.

 

  (e) The holders of Company Stock shall severally but not jointly
indemnify the Shareholders Representative and hold the Shareholders
Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred
without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, on the part of the Shareholders

 

62    
  

 Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Shareholders Representatives duties hereunder,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained
by the Shareholders Representative.

 

  (f) At any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement, a majority-in-
interest of holders of any amounts then held in the Escrow Fund may,
by written consent, appoint a new representative as the Shareholders
Representative. Notice together with a copy of the written consent appointing
such new representative and bearing the signatures of holders of a majority-
in-interest of those holders must be delivered to Parent and the Escrow Agent
not less than ten (10) calendar days prior to such appointment. Such
appointment will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the
consent or the date such consent is received by Parent and the Escrow Agent.

 

  (g) In the event that the Shareholders Representative becomes unable
or unwilling to continue in his or its capacity as Shareholders
Representative, or if the Shareholders Representative resigns as a
Shareholders Representative, a majority-in-interest of the holders of any
amounts then held in the Escrow Fund may, by written consent, appoint a
new representative as the Shareholders Representative. Notice and a copy of
the written consent appointing such new representative and bearing the
signatures of the holders of a majority-in-interest of such holders must be
delivered to Parent and the Escrow Agent. Such appointment will be effective
upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the date such consent
is received by Parent and the Escrow Agent.

privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or

herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

withdrawn prior to such termination and (ii) within 12 months following
the termination of this Agreement, either a Company Acquisition (as defined

in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment against the Company for such amount.

 

  Section 12.04. _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties

under this Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto, except
that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign, in whole or from time
to time in part, to one or more of their Affiliates, the right to enter into

County, California, and each of the parties hereby consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient form. Process in
any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on

  Section 12.08. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Benefit_. This Agreement
may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto
were upon the same instrument. This

 

68    
  

 Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received

respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

  Section 12.10. _Captions_. The captions herein are included for
convenience of reference only and shall be ignored in the construction

  Section 12.11. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
