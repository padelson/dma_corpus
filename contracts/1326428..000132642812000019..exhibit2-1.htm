The Purchase Price, as so adjusted, shall be the "Adjusted Purchase Price."

2.4 Guaranty. Prior to or contemporaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, Buyer has caused Guarantor to execute and deliver to Seller the
Guaranty Agreement pursuant to which Guarantor guarantees the payment and
performance of each obligation of Buyer under this Agreement.

  

  

2.5 Performance Deposit. Contemporaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, Buyer shall deposit with Seller cash equal to thirty percent (30%)
of the unadjusted Purchase Price ("Performance Deposit") by wire transfer to a
bank account designated by Seller prior to the Signing Date; provided,
however, that if the Signing Date is not a Business Day, Buyer shall deliver
the Performance Deposit to Seller at its designated bank account in the United
States before 12:00 p.m. CPT on the next Business Day.

  

  

ARTICLE III

  

PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS AND CONSENTS TO ASSIGNMENT

  

  

3.1 Allocated Values.

  

  

3.1.1 Buyer's good faith allocation of the value of the Properties is set
forth in Exhibits "A-1" through "A-3" ("Good Faith Allocation"), and shall be
used, if necessary, for purposes of Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 5.2.

  

  

3.1.2 On or before the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts agree upon an allocation of the unadjusted Purchase Price
among the Properties in compliance with the principles of Section 1060 of the
Code, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. If Seller and Buyer agree to
such allocation, Seller and Buyer agree (1) that such allocation shall be used
by Seller and Buyer as the basis for reporting asset values and other items
for purposes of all federal, state, and local Tax Returns, including without
limitation Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, (2) that neither Seller nor
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or direct or indirect owners will
take a position on any Tax Return, or before any Governmental Authority in
connection with the examination of a Tax Return or in any Tax Proceeding that
is in any manner inconsistent with such allocation, except as required by
applicable Law or with the written consent of the other Party, and (3) Buyer
and Seller agree that each shall furnish the other a copy of Form 8594 (Asset
Acquisition Statement under Section 1060) proposed to be filed with the
Internal Revenue Service by such Party or any Affiliate thereof thirty (30)
days prior to such filing.

  

  

3.2 Preferential Rights to Purchase.

  

  

3.2.1 The Parties agree that those preferential purchase rights set forth in
Schedule 3.2 that are currently attributable to the holders identified on such
schedule with respect to such preferential purchase rights may be triggered by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Applicable
Preferential Rights"). For each Property subject to any Applicable
Preferential Right, except any Applicable Preferential Right held by Buyer or
its Affiliates, Seller shall (i) provide such notice to the applicable Third
Party as may be required using the applicable Good Faith Allocation and the
form of Preferential Right Notice Letter attached hereto as Exhibit "G", or as

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

otherwise mutually agreed, and (ii) comply in all other respects with the
agreement under which the Applicable Preferential Right arises. If, prior to
Closing, the holder of an Applicable Preferential Right notifies Seller that
it elects to exercise its Applicable Preferential Right (in accordance with
and determined by the agreement under which such Applicable Preferential Right
arises), the Properties subject to such exercised Applicable Preferential
Right shall be excluded from this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the value allocated to such Property in Exhibits "A-1", "A-2", or
"A-3". Buyer remains obligated to purchase the remainder of the Properties
that are not affected by exercised Applicable Preferential Rights. Upon
consummation of the sale of any Properties to the holder of such Applicable
Preferential Right, any such Properties shall be deemed for all purposes to
constitute Excluded Properties.

  

  

3.2.2 If on the Closing Date, any Applicable Preferential Right has not been
waived in writing by the holder thereof or the time for such holder to
exercise such Applicable Preferential Right has not expired, then (subject to
Sections 15.2, 15.3 and 17.1) the Closing with respect to the Properties to
which such Applicable Preferential Right applies shall proceed upon the mutual
agreement of Seller and Buyer, so long as Seller's notification to the holder
of such Applicable Preferential Right was given at least thirty (30) Days
prior to such Closing Date.

  

  

3.2.3 If the Parties do not reach a mutual agreement as contemplated in the
prior paragraph, then the applicable Properties shall be deemed Excluded
Properties and the Closing shall otherwise proceed. Thereafter, Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer if the holder of the Applicable Preferential Right does
not exercise such right prior to the expiration of such right, then within ten
(10) Business Days after Buyer's receipt of such notice, the Parties shall
conduct a second closing whereby Seller shall sell, assign and convey to
Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and accept from Seller, such Property pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement and for the value allocated to such Properties
in Exhibits "A-1", "A-2" or "A-3" (except "Closing Date" with respect to any
such Property shall mean the date of assignment of such Property from Seller
to Buyer), subject to any purchase price adjustments consistent with this
Agreement. If for any reason the purchase and sale of the Properties covered
by the Applicable Preferential Rights which have been exercised by the holder
thereof are not or cannot be consummated with the holder of the Applicable
Preferential Rights in accordance with the agreement under which the
Applicable Preferential Right arises, or the holder of the Applicable
Preferential Right is unable to satisfy the conditions to closing contained
therein, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer and, if the Closing has not yet
occurred, the affected Property shall be included in the Closing or, if the
Closing has previously occurred, then within ten (10) Business Days after
Buyer's receipt of such notice, the Parties shall conduct an additional
closing whereby Seller shall sell, assign and convey to Buyer, and Buyer shall
purchase and accept from Seller, such Property pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and for the value allocated to such Properties in Exhibits "A-1",
"A-2" or "A-3" (except "Closing Date" with respect to any such Property shall
mean the date of assignment of such Property from Seller to Buyer), subject to
any Purchase Price adjustments consistent with this Agreement.

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  

3.2.4 If (i) the holder of an Applicable Preferential Right validly exercises
its Applicable Preferential Right after the Closing or (ii) the Parties
inadvertently close on a Property subject to a preferential purchase right
that is not listed on Schedule 3.2 (a "PPR"), either without having provided
the required notification to the holder of such Applicable Preferential Right
or PPR ("Pref Holder") or without such Pref Holder having waived such
Applicable Preferential Right or PPR or the time for such Pref Holder to
exercise such Applicable Preferential Right or PPR having expired, and (ii)
after the closing on such Property, the Pref Holder elects to exercise, then
Buyer shall convey such Property directly to the Pref Holder, and Buyer shall
be entitled to receive the consideration for such Property to be paid by such
Pref Holder directly from such Pref Holder; provided, however, that if such
Pref Holder requires that the conveyance of such Property be made by Seller,
then Buyer shall re-convey such Property to Seller in exchange for a refund
from Seller of the Good Faith Allocation of such Property, and Seller shall
then convey such Property to such Pref Holder and be entitled to retain the
consideration for such Property paid by such Pref Holder, in each of the
foregoing cases, subject to any purchase price adjustments consistent with
this Agreement.

  

  

3.2.5 Any Applicable Preferential Right or PPR must be exercised subject to
all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the payment to
Seller of the Performance Deposit upon exercise of the Applicable Preferential
Right or PPR.

  

  

3.2.6 For the avoidance of doubt, Third Party Claims relating to or arising
out of Applicable Preferential Rights or PPRs to the extent related to (i) a
Good Faith Allocation or (ii) Buyer's agreement to proceed with Closing prior
to receipt of a written waiver or expiration of an Applicable Preferential
Right or PPR (any such Third Party Claim, a "PPR Claim") shall not be a Seller
Retained Liability but shall be the responsibility of Buyer (without regard to
any deductibles or thresholds contained in this Agreement that may be
otherwise applicable). Buyer releases Seller Group from and shall fully
protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller Group from and against any
and all PPR Claims, no matter whether arising before, on or after the Closing
Date. This indemnity and defense obligation shall apply regardless of cause or
of any negligent acts or omissions (including active or passive, sole,
concurrent or comparative negligence or gross negligence), strict liability,
breach of duty (statutory or otherwise), violation of Law, or other fault of
Seller Group, or any pre-existing defect.

  

  

3.2.7 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer will have no
obligation to purchase any Property that was treated as an Excluded Property
pursuant to Section 3.2.3 after the Cut-Off Date.

  

  

3.3 Consents to Assignment.

  

  

3.3.1 If a required consent to assignment of a Property (other than Contracts
or Customary Post-Closing Consents) has not been obtained prior to Closing,
the Property with respect to which consent is required but not obtained shall
be excluded from this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted by
the value allocated to such Property in Exhibits "A-1", "A-2" or "A-3", if
any. Buyer remains obligated to

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

purchase from Seller the remainder of the Properties that are not subject to
such unobtained required consent, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. If Seller subsequently obtains any required consents prior to the
Cut-Off Date not obtained prior to or at Closing, Seller shall promptly notify
Buyer and within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer's receipt of such notice,
Seller shall sell, assign and convey to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase and
accept from Seller such Properties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
for the value allocated to such Properties in Exhibits "A-1", "A-2" or "A-3",
if any, with respect to such affected Property (except "Closing Date" with
respect to such Property shall mean the date of assignment of such Property
from Seller to Buyer).

  

  

3.3.2 With respect to Contracts constituting Properties that require consent
to assignment (other than Customary Post-Closing Consents), Seller shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain such consent prior to Closing using
the form of Consent Notice Letter attached hereto as Exhibit "H", or as
otherwise mutually agreed, and if such consent has not been obtained prior to
Closing, upon the mutual agreement of the Parties, Seller shall execute and
deliver such instruments and take such other actions as Buyer may reasonably
request to carry out the intent of this Agreement and the transfer of such
Contracts. Such instruments and actions shall include the execution of back-
to-back agreements to effect the transfer to Buyer of the benefits and burdens
of or on Seller under such Contracts which Seller is obligated to perform
(provided that entering into such back-to-back agreements does not result in a
breach of any obligations under any such Contract). In any such back-to-back
agreement (i) Seller shall continue to be bound thereby and (ii) (A) Buyer
shall perform and discharge fully all the obligations of Seller thereunder
after the Effective Time and indemnify Seller for all Claims arising out of
such performance by Buyer, (B) Seller shall, without further consideration
therefor, pay, assign and remit to Buyer promptly all monies, rights and other
considerations received in respect of such performance, (C) Seller shall
promptly exercise or exploit the beneficial rights and options of Buyer under
such Contract at Buyer's expense and (D) if and when any such consent shall be
obtained or such a Contract shall otherwise become assignable, Seller shall
promptly assign, in a manner consistent with Section 2.1, its rights and
obligations under such Contract to Buyer and Buyer shall, without the payment
of any further consideration therefor, assume such rights and obligations and
continue to indemnify Seller as stated above. To the extent that Seller is
unable to assign a Contract with respect to which Seller has elected that this
Section 3.3.2 shall apply, Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
continue to seek consent to assignment of such Contract until the earlier of
(x) the first anniversary of the Closing Date or (y) the date such Contract is
terminated in accordance with its terms or otherwise at the direction of
Buyer, to the extent such termination does not breach such Contract.

  

  

3.4 Applicable Consents and Waivers. Each Party hereby gives, and shall cause
its Affiliates to give, any required consents and hereby waives, and shall
cause its Affiliates to waive, any Applicable Preferential Rights or PPRs held
by such Party or its Affiliates.

ARTICLE IV

  

TITLE REVIEW

  

  

4.1 Review of Title Records. After execution and delivery of this Agreement
and prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall make available to Buyer and
Buyer's representatives, at reasonable times during Seller's regular business
hours and at their current locations (or such other locations as Seller
designates) upon reasonable notice, for examination and copying, at Buyer's
expense, Records in Seller's possession relating to title to the Properties.
If Buyer requests copies of title Records, Seller shall use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to provide the requested copies to Buyer at Buyer's
expense. Such review will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

  

4.2 Waiver. Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns)
hereby irrevocably waives and releases for all purposes all objections and
defects and Claims (whether known or unknown) associated with the title to the
Properties, except for any special warranty of title given in the Assignment
and Bill of Sale or Deed. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4.2 shall
not diminish or affect in any way the Parties' rights and obligations under
Section 19.6 or any indemnity provided in this Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE V

  

CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES

  

  

5.1 Access. Commencing after the Signing Date and until the Closing Date, but
subject to the succeeding sentence, Seller shall provide Buyer access (during
Seller's regular business hours and to the extent it does not unreasonably
interfere with Seller's operations) to the Properties that it operates, and
Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain permission for
Buyer to gain access to the Properties that are operated by Third Parties
after the Signing Date, to conduct a Phase I analysis of the same subject to
the following conditions, it being agreed that Buyer and its Representatives
may not conduct any Invasive Activities or inspections (other than a visual
inspection) and may not operate any equipment or machinery in the course of
such inspection. Notwithstanding anything otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Buyer shall not have the right to access the Ulysses Plant until
Seller provides Buyer notice in accordance with Section 5.2.6 that Seller has
completed the Ulysses Plant Remediation Project. Such inspection shall be (a)
conducted in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, (b)
subject to any releases or other agreements required by the operator of the
Properties, (c) only for the purpose of effecting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (d) subject at all times to Buyer's and its
Representatives' compliance with Seller's (or the applicable Third Party
operator's) applicable policies and procedures, including Seller's (or the
applicable Third Party operator's) code of conduct, digital security, health,
safety, security, and environmental policies and procedures. If, at any time,
Seller believes in good faith that Buyer or any of its Representatives have
not complied with Seller's (or the applicable Third Party operator's)
applicable policies and procedures, then Seller may immediately terminate
Buyer's and its Representatives' access to the Properties. Buyer shall be
responsible for arranging, at its own cost, transportation to and from any
such Properties. From and after the Signing Date until the Closing Date,
Seller shall make available to Buyer and its Representatives, at reasonable
times (which may be outside of normal business hours, such as evening hours
and on weekends, if approved by Seller) and at their current locations (or
such other locations as Seller designates)

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

upon reasonable notice, for examination and copying, all Records (other than
title Records and title information, which Records and information are
exclusively covered in Section 4.1) relating to the condition of the
Properties insofar as the same are in possession of Seller or its Affiliates
and, prior to the Signing Date, are not located at the Properties; provided,
that Seller may restrict access and provision of information to the extent it
reasonably believes necessary to (i) comply with existing confidentiality
obligations owed to Third Parties (provided further that Seller shall use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to secure waivers of any such confidentiality
obligations), (ii) ensure compliance with antitrust and other Laws, (iii)
preserve the secrecy of confidential information to the extent not related to
the Properties and (iv) preserve a valid legal privilege relating to existing
or anticipated Third Party Claims. From and after the Signing Date until the
Closing Date, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, Seller shall
afford Buyer and such Buyer's Representatives reasonable access to selected
employees of Seller Group that have been involved with the operation of the
Properties solely to the extent such access does not disrupt the daily
activities of such employees in any material respect. To the fullest extent
permitted by Law, Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and
assigns) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller Group, the other
owners of interests in the Properties and their respective officers,
directors, managers, employees, agents and representatives, from any and all
Claims, including those for (1) any injury, illness or death of any Persons
including Buyer Group, Seller Group or their respective Representatives; (2)
damages to property (including damage to property of Third Parties, Seller
Group, Buyer Group or their respective and/or of Buyer's Representatives); and
(3) damages to natural resources or environmental damage to or associated with
the Properties to the extent caused by, arising out of, or resulting from the
activities of Buyer Group or its Representatives in connection with any site
visit or physical inspection of the Properties even if such indemnified event
is caused by, arises out of or results from the active or passive, sole,
concurrent or comparative negligence or gross negligence, strict liability,
breach of duty (statutory or otherwise), violation of Law or other fault of
the aforesaid indemnified parties, or any pre-existing defect, but not to the
extent that such indemnified event or occurrence is caused by or the result of
willful misconduct of such indemnified parties.

  

  

5.2 Alleged Adverse Conditions.

  

  

5.2.1 Subject to Section 5.2.6, as soon as reasonably practicable, but not
later than the earlier of: (i) five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, and (ii) forty-five (45) Days after the Signing Date (such time period,
the "Adverse Condition Claim Period"), Buyer may notify Seller in writing of
any Adverse Conditions with respect to any of the Properties (each, an
"Alleged Adverse Condition"). Buyer's notice asserting Alleged Adverse
Conditions shall include a complete description and full explanation
(including copies of any and all supporting documentation associated
therewith) of each individual Alleged Adverse Condition being claimed and an
estimate of the Prudent Cost Response that Buyer in good faith attributes to
bringing such condition into compliance with Environmental Laws (such notice,
an "Adverse Condition Notice"). The Parties shall meet from time to time as
necessary in an attempt to agree on a resolution with respect to any
outstanding Alleged Adverse Conditions timely raised hereunder.

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

5.2.2 Seller has the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole
cost, to cure or remove any Alleged Adverse Condition with respect to the
Properties of which it has been duly advised by Buyer during the Adverse
Condition Claim Period or Ulysses Plant Adverse Conditions Claim Period (as
applicable). If prior to Closing or, solely with respect to Adverse Condition
Notices delivered in accordance with Section 5.2.6, if within ten (10)
Business Days after the end of the Ulysses Plant Adverse Conditions Claim
Period, Seller has given notice to Buyer that it elects to attempt to correct
the Alleged Adverse Condition, then Seller may elect, by written notice to
Buyer prior to the Closing, to continue to correct such condition to
completion following Closing; provided that if such Alleged Adverse Condition
is not corrected on or before one hundred eighty (180) Days after the Closing
or one hundred eighty (180) Days after the end of the Ulysses Plant Adverse
Condition Claim Period: (i) with respect to Alleged Adverse Conditions raised
pursuant to Section 5.2.6 or (ii) if the Adverse Condition Threshold Amount is
first exceeded during the Ulysses Plant Adverse Condition Claim Period, then,
upon Seller's receipt of written notice from Buyer of such non-completion
given within thirty (30) Days following the end of such one hundred eighty
(180) Day period, and subject to the right of Seller to initiate binding
arbitration in accordance with the provisions set forth in Article 18 to
resolve any dispute regarding any such alleged non-completion, Seller shall
pay to Buyer, subject to Section 5.2.5, an amount equal to the remaining
Prudent Cost Response for such Alleged Adverse Condition.

  

  

5.2.3 If the Parties are unable to agree as to the existence, validity, value
or resolution of one or more of the Alleged Adverse Conditions prior to
Closing (such inability to agree, an "Adverse Condition Dispute"), then
(subject to Sections 15.2, 15.3 and 17.1) Buyer shall be obligated to Close
and, except as to Alleged Adverse Conditions of which Seller has given notice
to Buyer that it elects to correct (as provided above), at Seller's election
either: (i) the affected Property shall be an Excluded Property and the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Good Faith Allocation of such Property,
(ii) subject to Section 5.2.5, Seller shall indemnify Buyer pursuant to
Section 8.3.2 and the Property shall remain a Property acquired by Buyer
without any adjustment of the Purchase Price or (iii) subject to Section
5.2.5, the Property shall remain a Property acquired by Buyer and the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the lesser of the Good Faith
Allocation of such Property and the Prudent Cost Response for such Alleged
Adverse Condition; provided however, that either Party may initiate, within
sixty (60) Days after Closing (but not later), binding arbitration in
accordance with the provisions set forth in Article 18 to resolve any dispute
arising prior to Closing regarding any Alleged Adverse Condition or the
Prudent Cost Response thereof, except as to Alleged Adverse Conditions of
which Seller has given notice that it elects to cure (as provided in Section
5.2.2). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, either Party may initiate,
within sixty (60) Days after the one hundred eighty (180) Day cure period (but
not later), binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions set forth in
Article 18 to resolve any dispute regarding the failure to pursue diligently a
cure or completion of the cure of an Alleged Adverse Condition that Seller has
elected to cure.

  

  

5.2.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 18, any arbitration
initiated under this Section 5.2 shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
a single arbitrator if the Adverse Condition Dispute involves less than Five
Million Dollars

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

($5,000,000) and by a panel of three arbitrators if the Adverse Condition
Dispute involves more than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). Any such
arbitrator (the "Environmental Referee") shall be an environmental attorney(s)
with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas facility environmental
matters, shall have not at any point in the past ten (10) years represented or
been adverse to either Party (or any of their Affiliates) and shall be
selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within thirty (30) Days after
the initiation of binding arbitration under Article 18, and absent such
agreement, shall be selected by the Houston, Texas regional office of the AAA
upon written request of either Party. Except as otherwise provided in the two
preceding sentences, Adverse Condition Dispute arbitrations shall be conducted
in accordance with Article 18.

  

  

5.2.5 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary but
subject to Seller's indemnification obligations set forth in Sections 8.2, 8.3
and 8.6, Buyer shall not be entitled to a Purchase Price adjustment, an
indemnity or any other remedy relating to an Adverse Condition unless (i) a
Claim for the Alleged Adverse Condition is asserted by Buyer within the
Adverse Condition Claim Period or the Ulysses Plant Adverse Conditions Claim
Period (as applicable), (ii) the amount of the Prudent Cost Response for such
individual Alleged Adverse Condition exceeds a threshold amount of One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "Adverse Condition Threshold Amount"), and (iii) the
Aggregate Transaction Claims for which Seller is responsible exceeds the
Aggregate Deductible Amount (it being acknowledged and agreed that, subject to
the provisions of Sections 8.2, 8.3 and 8.6, Buyer shall be solely responsible
for and bear all costs and expenses or loss of value associated with each
individual Alleged Adverse Condition asserted by Buyer hereunder up to the
Adverse Condition Threshold Amount and for the aggregate of the Alleged
Adverse Conditions to the extent they do not, when combined with the other
Aggregate Transaction Claims for which Seller is responsible, exceed the
Aggregate Deductible Amount). Seller's election to attempt to cure, or to
provide indemnity against an Alleged Adverse Condition, shall not constitute a
waiver of Seller's right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost
to cure, the Alleged Adverse Condition. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer may not assert an Alleged Adverse Condition
with respect to a Property (i) of which it is the operator or (ii) in which it
owns an interest and with respect to which it is aware of such Alleged Adverse
Condition.

  

  

5.2.6 Notwithstanding anything otherwise provided in this Section 5.2.6, Buyer
shall have the right to provide Seller an Adverse Condition Notice related
solely to the Ulysses Plant for a period beginning on the Day Seller gives
Buyer written notice that Seller has completed the Ulysses Plant Remediation
Project and ending on the Day which is thirty (30) Days later (the "Ulysses
Plant Adverse Conditions Claim Period"). Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Section 5.2.6, any Alleged Adverse Conditions related to the
Ulysses Plant shall be subject to the procedures set forth in Section 5.2.

  

  

5.3 Waiver. Except as provided in the next sentence of this Section 5.3, Buyer
(on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns) irrevocably waives
and releases for all purposes all objections and Claims associated with the
environmental,

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

physical, contractual and any other conditions of any Properties (including
Adverse Conditions and Alleged Adverse Conditions) unless (a) asserted within
the Adverse Condition Claim Period or the Ulysses Plant Adverse Conditions
Claim Period (as applicable) and as otherwise required by Section 5.2 and (b)
in excess of the Adverse Condition Threshold Amount and the Aggregate
Deductible Amount; provided however, all Alleged Adverse Condition Claims are
deemed waived for all purposes by Buyer unless they are either settled by
written agreement of the Parties or referred to arbitration under Article 18
in either case (x) within sixty (60) Days after the Adverse Condition Claim
Period as provided in Section 5.2.3 or the Ulysses Plant Adverse Conditions
Claim Period (as applicable), or (y) within sixty (60) Days after the cure
period lasting one hundred eighty (180) Days after the Adverse Condition Claim
Period or the Ulysses Plant Adverse Conditions Claim Period (as applicable),
for those Alleged Adverse Conditions for which Seller provides Buyer notice
that it will continue attempting to bring into compliance with Environmental
Law after the Adverse Condition Claim Period or the Ulysses Plant Adverse
Conditions Claim Period (as applicable), and, subject to the foregoing
exceptions, Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns)
irrevocably waives and releases and shall be solely responsible for any and
all Claims it and they may have against Seller and Seller Group with respect
to environmental, physical, contractual and any other conditions of the
Properties (including Adverse Conditions and Alleged Adverse Conditions). For
the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.3 shall not diminish or affect in any
way the Parties' rights and obligations under any indemnities provided in this
Agreement, including the indemnities set forth in Sections 8.3 and 8.6.

  

  

ARTICLE VI

  

ACCOUNTING

  

  

6.1 Products and Line Fill. Seller shall measure all Hydrocarbons, plant
products and residue gas associated with the Properties and stored in tanks
and vessels to the bottom of the applicable flange as of the Effective Time.
Seller shall determine the Line Fill, if any, as of the Effective Time. Seller
shall be entitled to the proceeds of such Hydrocarbons, helium and other
inerts, plant products and residue gas produced or attributable to the
Properties and saved for any period prior to the Effective Time, and shall be
entitled to the Line Fill, if any, as of the Effective Time, all at the prices
set forth in Schedule 6.1; provided, however, that all of the foregoing shall
be less any applicable production tax, severance tax or similar Tax or other
applicable deductions. Unless the actual amounts are readily available to
Seller reasonably in advance of Closing, the estimated amounts to which Seller
is entitled shall be included in the calculation of the Closing Purchase Price
and shall be incorporated into the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The
actual amounts to which Seller is entitled (to the extent the same differ from
the estimate included in the Preliminary Settlement Statement) shall be
accounted for in the Final Settlement Statement if they were not accounted for
in the Preliminary Settlement Statement. Buyer shall be entitled to the
proceeds of Hydrocarbons, helium and other inerts, plant products and residue
gas produced or attributable to the Properties and saved for any period after
the Effective Time.

  

  

6.2 Revenues, Expenses and Capital Expenditures. Except as expressly provided
otherwise in this Agreement:

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

6.2.1 Seller is entitled to all revenues and accounts receivable attributable
to the Properties it transfers, and is responsible for all expenses, accounts
payable and capital expenditures attributable to the Properties it transfers,
in each case to the extent they relate to the period prior to the Effective
Time.

  

  

6.2.2 Seller also is entitled to the sum of Three Hundred Forty Thousand
Dollars (US$340,000) per month (prorated on a daily basis for any partial
month) (as an agreed reimbursement in lieu of Seller's actual overhead) for
the period from the Effective Time until the Closing Date.

  

  

6.2.3 Buyer is entitled to all revenues and accounts receivable attributable
to the Properties it acquires, and is responsible for all expenses, accounts
payable and capital expenditures attributable to the Properties it acquires,
in each case to the extent they relate to the period from and after the
Effective Time.

  

  

6.2.4 Seller shall estimate the above amounts and incorporate such estimate
into the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The actual amounts (to the extent
the same differ from the estimate included in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement) shall be accounted for in the Final Settlement Statement.

  

  

6.3 Taxes.

  

  

6.3.1 Seller shall bear all Taxes attributable to the ownership or operation
of the Properties prior to and including the Closing Date, in the case of
income, franchise, margin and similar Taxes and prior to the Effective Time,
in the case of all other Taxes, and all deductions, credits or refunds
pertaining to the aforementioned Taxes, no matter when received, shall belong
to Seller. Buyer shall bear all Taxes attributable to the ownership or
operation of the Properties after the Closing Date, in the case of income,
franchise, margin, and similar Taxes and on and after the Effective Time, in
the case of all other Taxes and all deductions, credits or refunds pertaining
to the aforementioned Taxes no matter when received, shall belong to Buyer.
Property Taxes, whether or not based on production, shall be prorated based on
a percentage of the assessment period occurring before and after the Effective
Time. Property Taxes based on production (other than severance) shall be
deemed by the Parties to apply to production in the Tax period for which the
Tax is levied. Seller shall estimate all Taxes attributable to the ownership
or operation of the Properties (excluding Seller's income taxes, franchise
taxes or margin taxes) and incorporate such estimate, to be reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, into the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The actual
amounts (to the extent the same differ from the estimate included in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement) shall be accounted for by the Parties in the
Final Settlement Statement.

  

  

6.3.2 Buyer acknowledges that Sales Tax may be due and owing as a result of
Seller's transfer of the Properties to Buyer and that Buyer is solely liable
for any and all such Sales Tax. In Exhibit "A-2", Buyer and Seller have agreed
on the value of the tangible personal property being transferred. Seller shall
provide Buyer with such documentation and information as Buyer shall
reasonably request in connection with Buyer's determination as to whether any
of the tangible personal property being

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

transferred is eligible for an "isolated or occasional sale" exemption from
Sales Tax. Prior to the delivery of the Preliminary Settlement Statement,
Buyer shall provide Seller with documentation detailing the basis for Buyer's
allocation of the Purchase Price to any Property that is or is not subject to
Sales Tax. Buyer shall pay any Sales Tax on its acquisition of all nonexempt
tangible personal property by means of incorporating the amount into the
Preliminary Settlement Statement (and the actual amounts, to the extent the
same differ from the estimates included in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement, shall be accounted for in the Final Settlement Statement) and
Seller shall remit the Sales Tax collected from Buyer to the applicable
Governmental Authority. If Buyer qualifies for any exemptions, at least three
(3) Business Days prior to Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller with any
exemption certificates required by state Law and Seller shall be released from
collecting Sales Tax on otherwise taxable items that qualify for such
exemptions. If Seller is required to pay any Sales Tax, interest or penalty
thereon other than amounts taken into account in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement (as adjusted by the Final Settlement Statement), Buyer shall
reimburse Seller within thirty (30) Days after receipt of Seller's written
notice of the payment. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and
assigns) releases Seller Group from and shall fully protect, defend, indemnify
and hold harmless Seller Group from and against any and all Claims (no matter
when asserted) relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly or
indirectly, Sales Tax resulting from or associated with Seller's transfer of
the Properties to Buyer. These indemnity and defense obligations will apply
regardless of cause or of any negligent acts or omissions (including active or
passive, sole, concurrent or comparative negligence), strict liability, breach
of duty (statutory or otherwise), or other fault of Seller Group, or any pre-
existing defect.

  

  

6.3.3 Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of original or
amended Tax Returns and any audit, litigation, refund claim or other
proceeding (each a "Tax Proceeding") with respect to Taxes, provided that,
except to the extent such cooperation relates to Taxes for which the Party
asked to cooperate would be responsible under this Agreement, such requested
Party (i) shall incur no additional costs, expenses, fees or liabilities or
(ii) shall be reimbursed for all additional costs, expenses, fees or
liabilities as a result of or connected with the request. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision
of records, accounting data and information which are reasonably relevant to
any such Tax Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Buyer and Seller agree (a) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Properties relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until thirty (30) Days after the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer
or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Authority and (b) to give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other Party so requests, the Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall allow
the other Party to take possession of such books and records. Buyer and Seller
further agree, upon

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

request, to use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

  

  

6.3.4 Seller shall retain authority to settle any Tax Proceedings relating to
Taxes for all tax periods prior to the Effective Time, and to file any amended
Tax Returns resulting from any such settlement; provided, however, that Seller
shall take no action with respect to Taxes that would increase Buyer's
liability for Taxes under this Agreement or otherwise. Buyer shall have
authority to settle any Tax Proceedings relating to Tax for tax periods after
the Effective Time and to file any amended Tax Returns resulting from any such
settlement; provided, however, that Buyer shall take no action with respect to
Taxes that would increase Seller's liability for Taxes under this Agreement or
otherwise.

  

  

6.4 Obligations and Credits. All Prepaid Amounts attributable to the
Properties or other amounts paid by Seller (including amounts paid pursuant to
an authorization for expenditure) prior to the Effective Time in respect of
the Properties for services performed (or to be performed) or goods purchased
(or to be purchased) after the Effective Time, and not otherwise taken into
account in the Preliminary Settlement Statement, shall be reimbursed to Seller
by Buyer as provided in this Section 6.4. Seller shall estimate the above
amounts and incorporate such estimate into the Preliminary Settlement
Statement. The actual amounts (to the extent the same differ from the
estimates included in the Preliminary Settlement Statement) shall be accounted
for in the Final Settlement Statement.

  

  

6.5 Preliminary Settlement Statement. No later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall submit to Buyer a preliminary
settlement statement in substantially the form of Exhibit "I" (the
"Preliminary Settlement Statement") and include therewith an estimate,
prepared in good faith, of the Purchase Price due by Buyer, taking into
account the estimate of adjustments permitted hereunder as identified on such
form. In connection with Seller's preparation of the Preliminary Settlement
Statement, Buyer shall cooperate by timely delivering to Seller all
information in its possession relevant to the preparation of the Preliminary
Settlement Statement that is requested by Seller and that relates to the
Properties. Buyer shall have two (2) Business Days to review the Preliminary
Settlement Statement. On the Day following the expiration of such two (2)
Business Day review period, Buyer shall submit a written report containing any
changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The
Parties shall attempt to agree on a final Preliminary Settlement Statement no
later than one (1) Day prior to Closing. If the Parties are unable to agree by
that date, Seller's good faith estimate shall be used to determine the
adjustments to the Purchase Price to be used at Closing in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement.

  

  

6.6 Final Settlement Statement. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no
event later than one hundred eighty (180) Days after the end of the Transition
Period, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth the
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Article 6 and any other
adjustments to the Purchase Price expressly permitted hereunder, in
substantially the form of the Preliminary Settlement Statement (the "Final
Settlement Statement"). Upon request, Seller shall provide accounting support
for any entry on the Final

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

Settlement Statement of which Buyer is not already in possession. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in no event later than forty-five (45) Days after
Buyer receives the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer may deliver to Seller a
written report containing any changes that Buyer proposes in good faith to be
made to such statement, stating in reasonable detail its objections and the
amounts to which it objects. If Buyer fails to timely deliver the written
report to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Final
Settlement Statement, the statement as delivered by Seller shall be deemed to
be correct and shall be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to
further review, audit, arbitration or legal proceedings. If Buyer timely
delivers the written report to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to be
made to the Final Settlement Statement, then as soon as reasonably
practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) Days after Seller receives
Buyer's written report, the Parties shall meet and undertake to agree on the
final adjustments to the Final Settlement Statement. If the Parties fail to
agree on the final adjustments within the thirty (30) Day period, then either
Party, by written notice to the Accounting Referee and the other Party, may
submit the disputed items to the Accounting Referee for resolution (with copy
concurrently delivered to the other Party). Each Party shall have the right to
submit to the Accounting Referee (with copy concurrently delivered to the
other Party) (i) a position statement on such disputed items within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of the notice to the Accounting Referee and (ii) a
rebuttal statement to the other Party's position statement within ten (10)
Business Days after expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period. Failure
of a Party to timely submit its position statement to the Accounting Referee
shall constitute a waiver by such Party as to each particular item in dispute
and its agreement to the amount proposed by the other Party. Either Party may
request that the Accounting Referee accept or decline the appointment in
writing within ten (10) Business Days after its receipt of the initial
position statement. The Accounting Referee will make a determination resolving
the disputed items to be reflected in the Final Settlement Statement based on
the written position statements and rebuttal statements from Buyer and Seller
and the Accounting Referee shall not take any testimony or hear any oral
argument. The Accounting Referee may request, as it deems appropriate, any
additional information from (and provide opportunity to rebut responses to)
the Parties, with notice to both Parties of all such requests and the related
responses. The Parties shall respond promptly to all requests from the
Accounting Referee for additional information and clarification. The
Accounting Referee shall address only those items in dispute and may not
determine the disputed items to be greater than the greatest amount claimed by
a Party or smaller than the smallest amount claimed by a Party. The Accounting
Referee shall resolve the disputes within thirty (30) Days after expiration of
the ten (10) Day rebuttal period. The decision of the Accounting Referee shall
be in writing and will be final and binding on and non-appealable by the
Parties, absent manifest error. The fees and expenses associated with the
Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller and paid
promptly upon receipt of the Accounting Referee's invoices. Any amounts owed
by one Party to the other Party as a result of the Final Settlement Statement
shall be paid within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date when the
amounts are agreed upon by the Parties, are deemed correct as provided above
or the Parties receive the decision of the Accounting Referee, and the amounts
included in the Final Settlement Statement shall be final and binding between
the Parties and not subject to further audit, arbitration or other legal
proceeding. The Accounting Referee shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed matter submitted by either Party
and may not award damages or penalties to either Party with respect to any
matter. Except as expressly provided herein, whenever the Accounting Referee
is retained to resolve a dispute as provided

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

pursuant to this Agreement, the Accounting Referee may determine the issues in
dispute following such procedures, consistent with the express provisions of
this Agreement, as the Accounting Referee deems appropriate to the
circumstances and with reference to the amounts in issue. Except as expressly
provided herein, the Parties do not intend to impose any particular procedures
upon the Accounting Referee, it being the desire of the Parties that any such
disagreement shall be resolved as expeditiously and inexpensively as
reasonably practicable.

  

  

6.7 Post-Closing Revenues. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, Buyer shall pay Seller any and all amounts received after Closing
by Buyer (to the extent not accounted for in the Final Settlement Statement or
the Transition Services Agreement) that are attributable to the ownership of
the Properties prior to the Effective Time. Except as expressly provided
otherwise in this Agreement, Seller shall pay Buyer any and all amounts
received after Closing by Seller (to the extent not accounted for in the Final
Settlement Statement or the Transition Services Agreement) that are
attributable to the ownership of the Properties after the Effective Time. The
Party responsible for the payment of amounts received shall reimburse the
other Party within ninety (90) Days after the end of the month in which such
amounts were received by the Party responsible for payment and, if paid, no
further adjustments shall be made with respect to such amounts in the Final
Settlement Statement.

  

  

6.8 Post-Closing Expenses. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any and all costs and
disbursements paid after Closing by Buyer (to the extent not accounted for in
the Final Settlement Statement or the Transition Services Agreement) that are
attributable to the ownership of the Properties prior to the Effective Time.
Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for any and all costs and disbursements paid after Closing by
Seller (to the extent not accounted for in the Final Settlement Statement or
the Transition Services Agreement) that are attributable to the ownership of
the Properties after the Effective Time. The Party responsible for the payment
shall reimburse the other Party within ninety (90) Days after the end of the
month in which the applicable invoice and proof of payment of such invoice
were received by the Party responsible for payment and, if paid, no further
adjustments shall be made with respect to such amounts in the Final Settlement
Statement.

  

  

6.9 Audits. Seller has retained audit claims and other Claims against Third
Parties related to periods as an Excluded Property, as more specifically
described in Section 2.1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) Seller shall have the right to conduct and participate in audits
and other Claims related to joint operations or plant activities provided for
under any construction, operation, gas processing, gas purchase,
transportation or other Contract relating to the Properties in accordance with
the terms thereof and any audits or Claims conducted by any Governmental
Authority (whether or not being conducted as of the Closing Date), in each
case to the extent any such audit or Claim relates to periods prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) no audit or other Claim of Seller relating to the
Properties is waived or released by Seller under this Agreement nor shall any
indemnity in this Agreement affect any such audit Claim by Seller Group
related to joint operations under any operating or other agreement relating to
the Properties in accordance with the terms thereof to the extent any such
audit relates to periods for which Seller Group is responsible under this
Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

  

CASUALTY LOSS

  

  

7.1 Notice of Casualty Loss. From the Signing Date until Closing, Seller shall
notify Buyer in a reasonably timely manner of each instance of Casualty Loss
with respect to the Properties known to Seller.

  

  

7.2 Resolution of Casualty Loss.

  

  

7.2.1 If, after the Signing Date but prior to the Closing Date, any Property
suffers a Casualty Loss, then (subject to Sections 15.2, 15.3 and 17.1) Buyer
shall nevertheless be required to proceed to Closing with respect to such
Property and Seller shall elect by written notice to Buyer prior to Closing
either (i) to cause, at Seller's sole cost and expense, any such Property
affected by a Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored to a quality and
condition comparable to that existing with respect to such Property
immediately before the Casualty Loss using the Prudent Cost Response (in the
case of expenditures necessary to comply with Environmental Laws), as promptly
as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date, so
long as Seller is diligently pursuing such repairs or restoration activities
but not longer than one hundred eighty (180) Days after the Closing Date
unless mutually acceptable to the Parties) or (ii) to make an appropriate
monetary adjustment to the Purchase Price reflecting the "reduction in value"
of such Casualty Loss in accordance with Section 7.2.2.

  

  

7.2.2 For the purposes of this Article 7, "reduction in value" due to a
Casualty Loss is based on the principle that Seller should generally bear the
costs of repair and restoration of such Property to a quality and condition
comparable to that existing with respect to such Property immediately before
the Casualty Loss, limited (i) in the case of expenditures necessary to comply
with Environmental Laws, to the lesser of (A) the Prudent Cost Response and
(B) the Good Faith Allocation applicable to the affected Property in Exhibits
"A-1", "A-2", or "A-3" and (ii) in the case of expenditures not necessary to
comply with Environmental Laws, to the Good Faith Allocation applicable to the
affected Property in Exhibits "A-1", "A-2", or "A-3" and (iii) in all cases,
to the amount which, when combined with the other Aggregate Transaction Claims
for which Seller is responsible, exceeds the Aggregate Deductible Amount;
provided that, if such repair or restoration costs result in the Properties
having a quality or condition better than that existing immediately prior to
the Casualty Loss, Buyer shall bear, or reimburse Seller if already incurred
by Seller, an equitable portion of such repair or restoration costs. If
Section 7.2.1(ii) is applicable, Seller shall notify Buyer at least ten (10)
Days prior to the Closing of its proposed monetary adjustment and if the
Parties have a dispute regarding the amount of the appropriate monetary
adjustment (such dispute, a "Casualty Loss Dispute"), the Parties shall Close
with an adjusting payment to Buyer in the amount of Seller's good faith
estimate of the reduction in value associated with such Casualty Loss and
equitable allocation of repair or restoration costs to Buyer; provided,
however, either Party may initiate, within thirty (30) Days (but not later)
after the Closing Date, binding arbitration in accordance with Article 18 to
resolve the Casualty Loss Dispute by delivering to the other Party a written
notice setting forth the

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

Casualty Loss in dispute, the Properties affected, the specific description of
the Casualty Loss, such Party's good faith estimate of the value of such
Casualty Loss and equitable allocation of cost, and any available
documentation upon which such Party's belief is based as to the existence,
validity, value or cure of such Casualty Loss (such notice, a "Casualty Loss
Dispute Notice").

  

  

7.2.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 18, any arbitration
initiated under this Section 7.2 shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
a single arbitrator if the Casualty Loss Dispute involves less than Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000) and by a panel of three arbitrators if the
Casualty Loss Dispute involves more than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000).
Any such arbitrator (the "Casualty Referee") shall be an insurance loss
consultant(s) with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas facility
insurance loss analysis matters, shall have not at any point in the past ten
(10) years represented or been adverse to either Party or any of their
Affiliates and shall be selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller
within fifteen (15) Days after the delivery and receipt of the applicable
Casualty Loss Dispute Notice, and absent such agreement, shall be selected by
the Houston, Texas regional office of the AAA upon written request of either
Party. Except as otherwise provided in the preceding two sentences, Casualty
Loss Dispute arbitrations shall be conducted in accordance with Article 18;
provided, if there is a difference between the good faith estimates of Seller
and Buyer as to the reduction in value or equitable allocation of costs in
excess of twenty percent (20%) of such arithmetical average, then the
arbitrators shall be obligated to select as the reduction in value one of the
good faith estimates proposed by the Parties, but not another amount in
between the two estimates or otherwise. Any Claim for a Casualty Loss not
referred to binding arbitration under Article 18 within thirty (30) Days after
Closing shall be deemed waived.

  

  

7.2.4 In each case, Seller shall be entitled to retain all rights to insurance
and other Claims against Third Parties with respect to the Casualty Loss,
except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

  

  

7.2.5 As used in Section 7.2, Prudent Cost Response shall not include costs
related to Decommissioning, Asbestos and Related Liabilities, Process Safety
Management and Disclosed Environmental Liabilities.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND INDEMNITIES

  

  

8.1 Opportunity for Review. Each Party represents that it has had an adequate
opportunity to review all waiver, release, indemnity and defense provisions in
this Agreement, including the opportunity to submit the same to legal counsel
for review and advice. Based upon the foregoing representation, the Parties
agree to the provisions set forth below.

  

  

8.2 Seller's Non-Environmental Indemnity Obligation. If Closing occurs, then
from and after the Closing Date, Seller hereby releases Buyer Group from, and,
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.7 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, shall fully protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
Group from and against, (a) all Non-

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

Environmental Claims relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly
or indirectly (and whether asserted before or after Closing without extending
the time limitations of Section 8.7), the ownership or operation of the
Properties, or any part thereof, to the extent such Non-Environmental Claims
are attributable to the period prior to the Effective Time and of which Buyer
provides notice to Seller in accordance with Section 8.8 within twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date, including Non-Environmental Claims relating to
(A) injury, illness or death of any Person, (B) damages to or loss of any
property or resources, (C) breach of contract, (D) common law causes of action
such as active or passive, sole, concurrent or comparative negligence or gross
negligence, strict liability, nuisance or trespass, or (E) violation of Law;
and (b) all Claims arising out of any breach by Seller of Seller's
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement. These
indemnity and defense obligations apply regardless of cause or of any
negligent acts or omissions (including active or passive, sole, concurrent or
comparative negligence or gross negligence), strict liability, breach of duty
(statutory or otherwise), violation of Law, or other fault of Buyer Group, or
any pre-existing defect. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Seller has no obligation under this Agreement or otherwise to
protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer Group from and against any
Non-Environmental Claims to the extent that Buyer is not entitled to a remedy
therefor under Section 8.7. As of Closing, Buyer releases Seller Group from,
and assumes and is solely responsible for, all Non-Environmental Claims either
waived by Buyer or not subject to indemnification by Seller at the time in
question under the terms of this Section 8.2.

  

  

8.3 Seller's Environmental Indemnity Obligation.

  

  

8.3.1 If Closing occurs, then from and after the Closing Date, Seller hereby
releases Buyer Group from, and, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 8.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement, shall fully protect, defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer Group from and against, all Environmental
Claims (other than Decommissioning, Asbestos and Related Liabilities, Process
Safety Management and Disclosed Environmental Liabilities) relating to,
arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly (and whether
asserted before or after Closing without extending the time limitations of
Section 8.7), the ownership or operation of the Properties, or any part
thereof, to the extent such Environmental Claims are attributable to the
period prior to the Effective Time and of which Buyer provides notice to
Seller in accordance with Section 8.8 within six (6) months after the Closing
Date, including in all such cases Environmental Claims relating to (A) injury,
illness or death of any Person, (B) damages to or loss of any property or
resources, (C) breach of contract, (D) common law causes of action such as
active or passive, sole, concurrent or comparative negligence or gross
negligence, strict liability, nuisance or trespass, or (E) violation of Law.

  

  

8.3.2 If Closing occurs and Seller has elected under Section 5.2.2 to
indemnify Buyer with respect to an Alleged Adverse Condition, then on and
after the Closing Date, Seller shall release Buyer Group from, and, subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 5.2 (including thresholds and time
limitations therein) and Section 8.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement, shall
fully protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer Group from and
against any and all Claims

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, such
Alleged Adverse Condition (provided that this Section 8.3.2 shall not be
applicable to any Environmental Claims, all of which are covered exclusively
in accordance with Section 8.3.1).

  

  

8.3.3 These indemnity and defense obligations apply regardless of cause or of
any negligent acts or omissions (including active or passive, sole, concurrent
or comparative negligence or gross negligence), strict liability, breach of
duty (statutory or otherwise), violation of Law, or other fault of Buyer
Group, or any pre-existing defect. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Seller has no obligation under this Agreement or otherwise to
protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer Group from and against any
Environmental Claims to the extent that Buyer is not entitled to a remedy
therefor under Section 8.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement. As of Closing,
Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns) releases
Seller Group from, and assumes and is solely responsible for, all
Environmental Claims either waived by Buyer or not subject to indemnification
by Seller at the time in question under the terms of this Section 8.3.

  

  

8.4 Buyer's Non-Environmental Indemnity Obligation. If Closing occurs, then
from and after the Closing Date, Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their
successors and assigns) hereby releases Seller Group from, and shall fully
protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller Group from and against,
(a) all Non-Environmental Claims relating to, arising out of, or connected
with, directly or indirectly (and whether asserted before or after Closing
without extending the time limitations of Section 8.7), the ownership or
operation of the Properties, or any part thereof, to the extent such Non-
Environmental Claims are attributable to (i) the Good Faith Allocation, (ii)
applicable PPR, to the extent Buyer and Seller agree to close prior to receipt
of a written waiver of such purchase rights, (iii) the period prior to the
Effective Time (no matter when asserted) for any Non-Environmental Claims for
which (x) Seller owes no indemnity under this Agreement or Seller's indemnity
obligation under this Agreement has expired, (y) the time period set forth in
Section 8.7 has expired, or (z) the threshold and deductible amounts set forth
in Section 8.7 are not met, and (iv) the period of time on or after the
Effective Time, including Non-Environmental Claims relating to (A) injury,
illness or death of any Person, (B) damages to or loss of any property or

active or passive, sole, concurrent or comparative negligence or gross
negligence, strict liability, nuisance or trespass, or (E) violation of Law;
and (b) all Claims arising out of any breach by Buyer of Buyer's
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement. These
indemnity and defense obligations apply regardless of cause or of any
negligent acts or omissions (including active or passive, sole, concurrent or
comparative negligence or gross negligence), strict liability, breach of duty
(statutory or otherwise), violation of Law, or other fault of Seller Group, or
any pre-existing defect.

  

  

8.5 Buyer's Environmental Indemnity Obligation. Subject to Buyer's rights to

adjustment therefore, if

Closing occurs, then from and after the Closing Date, Buyer (on behalf of
Buyer Group and their successors and assigns) hereby releases Seller Group
from, and shall fully protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller
Group from and against, all Environmental Claims (including Decommissioning,
Asbestos and Related Liabilities, Process Safety Management and Disclosed
Environmental Liabilities) relating to, arising out of, or connected with,
directly or indirectly (and whether asserted before or after Closing without
extending the time limitations of Section 8.7), the ownership or operation of
the Properties, or any part thereof, to the extent such Environmental Claims
are attributable to (i) the period prior to the Effective Time for any
Environmental Claims for which (x) Seller owes no indemnity under this
Agreement or Seller's indemnity obligation under this Agreement has expired,
(y) the time period set forth in Section 8.7 has expired, or (z) the threshold
and deductible amounts set forth in Section 8.7 are not met, (ii) the period
prior to the Effective Time for any Environmental Claims for Decommissioning,
Asbestos and Related Liabilities, Disclosed Environmental Liabilities or

Person indemnified hereunder, (2) Seller's failure to properly or timely pay
royalties prior to the Effective Time, (3) the matters described in Schedule

Sections 10.1.1 through 10.1.3. Claims under this Section 8.6 may be made even
if a Claim could also be asserted under Sections 8.2 or 8.3 and Claims under

Section 8.7.

  

  

8.7 Claim Periods and Deductibles. Seller will not have an obligation or
liability to the Buyer Group under Sections 8.2 and 8.3 for:

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

8.7.1 any Claim under Sections 8.2, if Buyer has not provided Seller with an
Indemnity Claim Notice within twelve (12) months from and after the Closing
Date with respect to such Claim or any Claim under Sections 8.3, if Buyer has
not provided Seller with an Indemnity Claim Notice within six (6) months from
and after the Closing Date with respect to such Claim (other than Claims under
Section 8.3.2, which shall survive indefinitely);

  

  

8.7.2 any Claim under Sections 8.2 or 8.3, if such Claim has a value of One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or less (and these types of Claims shall not be
counted in determining the Aggregate Deductible Amount);

  

  

8.7.3 any Claim to the extent the Aggregate Transaction Claims for which
Seller is responsible do not exceed the Aggregate Deductible Amount (and
Claims for which Seller is not responsible, including liabilities and
obligations assumed by Buyer under Section 12.3 shall not be counted in
determining the Aggregate Deductible Amount);

  

  

8.7.4 Seller's aggregate liability for indemnification for Claims arising
under this Agreement shall be limited to Twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase
Price;

  

  

8.7.5 any Claim asserted against Seller to the extent Buyer Group has
liability for the matters underlying such Claim pursuant to any Contract
(other than this Agreement or any Operative Documents) between the Parties or
their respective Affiliates (by way of example, and not in limitation thereof,
under any construction, operation, gas processing, gas purchase,
transportation or other agreement relating to the Properties);

  

  

8.7.6 any Consequential Damages resulting from or arising out of any Claim by
Buyer (other than Consequential Damages awarded against Buyer as a result of a
Third Party Claim); and

  

  

8.7.7 any Claims expressly waived by Buyer in this Agreement or other written
agreement.

  

  

8.8 Notice of Claims. If a Claim is asserted against a Person for which a
Party may have an obligation of indemnity and defense under this Article 8 or
any other provision of this Agreement (an "Indemnity Claim"), the indemnified
Person shall give the indemnifying Party prompt written notice of the
underlying Claim setting forth the particulars associated with the underlying
Claim (including a copy of the written underlying Third Party Claim, if any)
as then known by the indemnified Person ("Indemnity Claim Notice"). For
Indemnity Claims with respect to which the threshold limitations in Section
8.7 apply, an Indemnity Claim shall be deemed to have been made (subject to
the other provisions of Section 8.7) upon the indemnified Person's providing
an initial Indemnity Claim Notice to the indemnifying Party stating that the
Claim underlying the Indemnity Claim could reasonably be expected in good
faith to exceed the applicable threshold amount. The indemnified Person shall,
to the extent practicable, give an Indemnity Claim Notice within such time as
shall allow the

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

indemnifying Party a reasonable period in which to evaluate and timely respond
to the underlying Claim; provided, however, that (a) failure to do so shall
not affect an indemnified Person's rights hereunder except for, and only to
the extent of, any incremental costs incurred by the indemnified Person with
respect to the Indemnity Claim resulting from the failure to give notice; (b)
the foregoing shall not extend the time periods set forth in Section 8.7 (if
applicable to the Claim), but if an Indemnity Claim Notice is given to an
indemnifying Party within the applicable time period (if any) with respect to
such Claim set forth in Section 8.7, such Indemnity Claim Notice shall be
effective, subject to the other provisions of Article 8, as to costs and
expenses incurred or suffered after the expiration of any such time period,
with respect to the matter generally described in such Indemnity Claim Notice;
and (c), without extending the time periods set forth in Section 8.7, the
indemnified Person shall not be required to provide an Indemnity Claim Notice
unless and until such Person believes that the Claim underlying the Indemnity
Claim could reasonably be expected in good faith to exceed the applicable
threshold (if any) set forth in Section 8.7.

  

  

8.9 Defense of Third Party Claims. Upon receipt of an Indemnity Claim Notice
involving a Third Party for which an indemnifying Party believes it may have
an obligation of indemnity under this Agreement, the indemnifying Party shall,
if it so elects in accordance with this Section 8.9 (without prejudice to its
right to contest its obligation of indemnity under this Agreement), assume the
defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the indemnifying
Party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified Person as provided herein
below. The indemnified Person shall cooperate in all reasonable respects;
provided, however, it shall not be obligated to incur any out-of-pocket cost
or expense in such defense. If any Third Party Claim involves a fact pattern
wherein each Party may have an obligation to indemnify the other Party, each
Party may assume the defense of and hire counsel for that portion of the Third
Party Claim for which it may have an obligation of indemnity. In all
instances, the indemnified Person may employ separate counsel and participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim; provided, however, if the
indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to
this Section 8.9 and has agreed to indemnify the indemnified Person, the fees
and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified Person shall be borne
solely by the indemnified Person. If (a) the underlying Third Party Claim
meets any applicable per-Claim threshold, (b) the underlying Third Party Claim
plus all previously asserted underlying Claims that meet any applicable per-
Claim threshold have exceeded the Aggregate Deductible Amount, if applicable
in the circumstances, and (c) the indemnifying Party elects, by written
notice, to undertake the defense of the Third Party Claim within thirty (30)
Days after receipt of the Indemnity Claim Notice, then, subject to the
limitations on indemnity contained in this Agreement, (i) the indemnifying
Party shall defend the indemnified Person against such Third Party Claim, (ii)
the indemnifying Party shall pay any judgment entered or settlement with
respect to such Third Party Claim, (iii) the indemnifying Party shall not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to such Third Party Claim that (A) does not include a provision whereby the
plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the indemnified Person from all
liability with respect to such Third Party Claim and (B) would restrict such
indemnified Person's ability to conduct its business, and (iv) the indemnified
Person shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying
Party's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If the indemnifying Party has not elected to undertake the defense of
a Third Party Claim, or if the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

pursuant to this Section 8.9 but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the
Third Party Claim, then the indemnified Person shall have the right to defend,
at the sole cost and expense of the indemnifying Party (to the extent the
indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), the Third Party
Claim by all appropriate proceedings. In such instances, the indemnified
Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings; provided that
the indemnified Person shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the
written consent of the indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that if the
indemnifying Party fails to notify the indemnified Person in writing as to
whether or not it consents to such proposed settlement within the shorter of
(i) fifteen (15) Days following its receipt of notice of such proposed
settlement from the indemnified Person and (ii) the offer period under such
proposed settlement (but in no event less than five (5) Business Days
following its receipt of notice of such proposed settlement), then such
consent shall be deemed given. Any notification by such indemnifying Party
that it is withholding its consent to any proposed settlement shall provide a
reasonably detailed explanation of the reasons for withholding its consent.
The indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by an indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 8.9,
and the indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect
to such participation. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section
8.9, if the indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to the
indemnified Person under this Section 8.9 and if such dispute is resolved in
favor of the indemnifying Party, the indemnifying Party shall not be required
to bear the costs and expenses of the indemnified Person's defense pursuant to
this Section 8.9.

  

  

8.10 Cooperation and Mitigation. If requested by the indemnifying Party, the
indemnified Person agrees to cooperate with the indemnifying Party and its
counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the indemnifying Party
elects to contest or, if appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the
Person asserting the Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any
Person; provided that the indemnifying Party shall reimburse the indemnified
Person for any reasonable expenses incurred by it in so cooperating at the
request of the indemnifying Party. The indemnified Party has a duty to
mitigate any Claims to which a right of indemnity applies under this
Agreement.

  

  

8.11 Right to Participate. The indemnified Person agrees to afford the
indemnifying Party and its counsel the opportunity, at the indemnifying
Party's expense, to be present at, and to participate in, conferences with all
Persons asserting any Third Party Claim against the indemnified Person and
conferences with representatives of or counsel for such Persons.

  

  

8.12 Waiver of Certain Damages. Each Party irrevocably waives and agrees not
to seek Consequential Damages of any kind in connection with any dispute
arising out of or related to this Agreement (including the breach thereof) or
the transactions contemplated hereby except to the extent such damages are
expressly permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement and, in such case, only
with regard to a breach of the Confidentiality Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section 8.12 does not diminish or otherwise affect the Parties'
rights and obligations to be indemnified against, and provide indemnity for
Consequential Damages awarded to any Third Party for which

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

indemnification is provided in this Agreement or Seller's right to receive
liquidated damages, including the Performance Deposit, pursuant to the terms
of Section 17.2.

  

  

8.13 No Duplication of Remedies. In no event shall either Party be entitled to
duplicate compensation with respect to any Claim or any breach of
representation, warranty or agreement herein asserted under the terms of this
Agreement, even though such Claim or breach may be addressed by more than one
provision of this Agreement. Non-Environmental Claims and Environmental Claims
are excluded from the expenses described in Sections 6.2 and 6.8, and the
revenues described in Section 6.7. Payments for Claims under this Article 8
shall not affect the allocation of such expenses or revenues between the
Parties, and the allocation of such expenses and revenues between the Parties
shall not affect payments for Claims under this Article 8. For the avoidance
of doubt, Buyer's Claims for indemnification under this Agreement are limited
to the portion of any Claim properly attributable to Seller's ownership
interest in the Property giving rise to such a Claim.

  

  

8.14 Survival. The representations and warranties of the Parties in Articles
10 and 11 and the pre-Closing covenants shall survive for twelve (12) months
from the Closing Date; provided however that the representations and
warranties of Seller in Sections 10.1.1 through 10.1.3 and the representations
and warranties of Buyer in Sections 11.1.1 through 11.1.3 shall survive until
thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. The indemnities in Sections 8.2 and 8.3 shall terminate as of the
termination date set forth in Section 8.7.1 or, if no termination date is set
forth in that Section, then as of the termination date of each representation,
warranty, covenant or provision that is subject to indemnification thereunder,
except in each case as to matters for which a specific notice of Claim
properly asserted within the applicable time period for such Claim has been
delivered to the indemnifying Party on or before such termination date. Buyer
and its successors and assigns will not be released from any of, and shall
remain jointly and severally liable to the Seller Group for, the obligations
and liabilities of Buyer under this Agreement upon any transfer or assignment
of any Property. Indemnities and other covenants and provisions in this
Agreement for which no survival period or termination date is expressly stated
herein will survive the Closing without time limit.

  

  

8.15 Exclusive Remedy. Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter
of Law, if Closing occurs, the indemnities set forth in this Agreement shall
be the exclusive remedy for breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, nothing in this Section 8.15
shall be deemed to affect any Person's right to equitable relief (including
specific performance in a court of law) for breach of a covenant set forth in
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement shall give rise to any right on the part of Buyer, after Closing, to
rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

8.16 Existing Contracts between the Parties. If Buyer and Seller are currently
parties to certain of the contracts affecting the Properties, then Buyer and
Seller agree that, upon Closing, the Parties' indemnities of one another
pertaining to the Properties or any portions thereof, in such existing
Contracts are superseded and replaced in their entirety by the

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

indemnities in this Agreement, regardless of whether the claim or matter in
question to which the indemnities relate arose before or arise after the
Effective Time.

FrontStreet Gathering System. Within three (3) Business Days after the Signing

employees of Seller Group who fill those positions other than the Excluded
Employees (as hereinafter defined) (collectively, the "Employees"), including
positions of employees who are receiving short-term disability benefits or are
on family and medical, medical/long-term disability, administrative or
military leave or any other type of leave that entitles the employee to
reinstatement upon completion of the leave under the applicable leave policies
of Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, "Leave"). The Employee List shall
include for each Employee the current status, job title, seniority date, work
location, vacation eligibility, base salary, bonus target, and long-term
incentive target. Within three (3) Business Days after the Signing Date,
Seller shall provide to Buyer a list (the "Excluded Employee List") of
employees of Seller Group who are employed exclusively in the operation of the
Properties who will not be made available to Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates for
interview or employment (collectively, the "Excluded Employees"). Seller shall
be entitled to update the Employee List as necessary at any time prior to the
expiration of the Transition Period to reflect any and all employment changes.
Notwithstanding anything that may be contained in Sections 14.2 and 14.3
below, Seller Group reserves the right to make employment offers to any of the
Employees as well as the Excluded Employees prior to the end of the Transition
Period.

  

  

14.2 Employment Offers to Active Employees. Commencing ten (10) Business Days
after the Signing Date, Seller or its Affiliates shall provide to Buyer upon
request reasonable access to the Employees. Buyer covenants that no later than
fifteen (15) Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates,
shall offer employment with Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates, effective as of the
later of the Closing Date or, with respect to Employees engaged in providing
services on behalf of Seller under the Transition Services Agreement, the
expiration of the Transition Period, to all active Employees except for the
Excluded Employees, at the same or better salaries or wages, with similar
duties and responsibilities, at the same location and on the

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

same status (e.g., full-time or part-time), as provided by Seller Group
immediately prior to the Closing Date or the expiration of the Transition
Period, contingent upon such Employee passing an appropriate background check
and drug screening test. All Employees who accept employment with Buyer or
Buyer's Affiliates pursuant to the offers described either in this Section
14.2 or in Section 14.3 are referred to herein as "Transferred Employees."
Buyer covenants that no Transferred Employee's initial base salary or wages as
an employee of Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates shall be reduced during the twelve
(12)-month period after such Transferred Employee commences employment with
Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates, unless such Transferred Employee is terminated,
in which case Section 14.12 shall apply. Buyer covenants that Buyer or Buyer's
Affiliates shall offer each active Employee no less than ten (10) Days during
which to accept or reject Buyer's or its Affiliates' employment offer.,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Article 14.

  

  

14.3 Employment Offers to Employees on Leave. In addition, Buyer covenants
that no later than fifteen (15) Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer or
Buyer's Affiliates shall offer employment with Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates to
each Employee who is on Leave as of the expiration of the Transition Period,
except for the Excluded Employees, with such employment commencing at such
time as such Employee is ready to return to work (but not sooner than the
later of the Closing Date or, with respect to Employees on Leave who would be
engaged in providing services on behalf of Seller under the Transition
Services Agreement, the expiration of the Transition Period), at the same or
better salaries or wages, with similar duties and responsibilities, at the
same location and on the same status (e.g., full-time or part-time), as
provided by Seller Group immediately prior to the commencement of such
Employee's Leave; provided, however, that such Employee is ready to return to
work within one hundred twenty (120) Days after the expiration of the
Transition Period and contingent upon such Employee passing an appropriate
background check and drug screening test. Buyer covenants that Buyer or
Buyer's Affiliates shall offer each Employee on Leave no less than ten (10)
Days during which to accept or reject Buyer's or its Affiliates' employment
offer.

  

  

14.4 Transfer Time. All Transferred Employees shall become employees of Buyer
or Buyer's Affiliates, effective as of 12:00 a.m. CPT on the later of the
Closing Date or, with respect to Employees engaged in providing services on
behalf of Seller under the Transition Services Agreement, the Day the
Transition Period expires and, except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer
covenants that at such time Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates shall assume and be
responsible for payment of all salaries and benefits and all other costs and
liabilities relating to services provided by the Transferred Employees
effective as of such time; provided that, with respect to an Employee on
Leave, such obligations shall not attach until the Employee on Leave commences
employment with Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates.

  

  

14.5 Level of Employee Benefits Provided by Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates. Buyer
covenants that Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates shall provide to all Transferred
Employees employee benefits in accordance with employee benefit plans (such as
defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and welfare benefit plans),
programs, policies and pay practices (such as vacations, bonuses and short-
term disability leaves) which shall be the same as or better than the benefits
provided to substantially similar employees of Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates.
Effective on the termination date of the Transferred Employee with Seller
Group, Seller shall update the Employee List to provide to Buyer the then
current hire date, recognized credited

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

service amount, seniority date, salary or wage level information, and
participation, vesting and, as applicable, benefit accrual periods of service
amounts, with Seller Group for such Transferred Employee. Effective as of
their termination date with Seller Group, the Transferred Employees shall
cease to accrue benefits under all employee benefit plans and programs of
Seller Group.

  

  

14.6 Defined Contribution Pension Plans. Buyer covenants that, effective as of
the expiration of the Transition Period, Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates' defined
contribution pension plans in which the Transferred Employees participate
shall be amended to recognize such Transferred Employees' participation and
vesting periods of service with Seller Group for purposes of determining
participation, vesting and the level of company contributions to the extent
permissible under Law.

  

  

14.7 Welfare Benefits and Other Benefits and Policies. Except as would result
in duplication of benefits and except as otherwise required by Law, for each
Transferred Employee who participates in any welfare benefit plan, or is
subject to any policy or pay practice, of Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates, Buyer
covenants that both Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates, and the applicable welfare
benefit plan, policy and pay practice: (i) shall recognize the Transferred
Employee's recognized credited service amounts with Seller Group for all
purposes including eligibility, vesting, and benefit determination and
accrual; (ii) shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause its third
party insurance providers or third party administrators to waive any physical
examination requirements or other proof of insurability, and to waive all
coverage exclusions and limitations, except as subject to Buyer's and Buyer's
Affiliates' insurance carrier's requirements and limitations for similarly
situated employees of Buyer, relating to waiting periods or pre-existing
conditions, with respect to any of the Transferred Employees or any dependent
covered by Seller Group's comparable welfare benefit plan, policy or pay
practice in effect as of the expiration of the Transition Period; and (iii)
shall credit the expenses of the Transferred Employees which were credited
toward deductibles, co-insurance or co-payments for the year in which the
Transferred Employee terminates employment with Seller Group under the
applicable welfare benefit plan of Seller Group against satisfaction of any
deductibles, co-insurance or co-payments for the year in which the Transferred
Employee commences employment with Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates under Buyer's
or Buyer's Affiliates' medical welfare benefit plan for the Transferred
Employees. Should Buyer, through Commercially Reasonable Efforts, determine
that it is unable to credit the expenses of the Transferred Employees that the
Transferred Employees accumulated through deductibles, co-insurance or co-
payments, Buyer agrees to otherwise credit, pay or compensate the Transferred
Employees for those expenses.

  

  

14.8 Vacation. Seller shall be responsible for paying the Transferred
Employees for any accrued but unused vacation benefits due as of the last Day
of such Transferred Employee's employment with Seller Group, up to, and
including, the termination date of the Transferred Employee with Seller Group,
under the applicable vacation policy of Seller Group (the "Seller Vacation
Policy"). Buyer covenants that, in the event that any Transferred Employee is
eligible under the Seller Vacation Policy for a greater amount of annual
vacation than such Transferred Employee is eligible for under Buyer's or
Buyer's Affiliates' vacation policy even after Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates
recognize such Transferred Employee's credited service amounts with Seller
Group, Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates shall provide such Transferred Employee
with the amount of annual vacation for which such Transferred Employee

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

was eligible under the Seller Vacation Policy. Between the expiration of the
Transition Period and the end of the year in which the expiration of the
Transition Period occurs, Buyer covenants that Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates,
shall permit all Transferred Employees to take the same number of Days of
vacation on an unpaid basis as they would have been eligible to take as of the
Day immediately prior to the expiration of the Transition Period under the
Seller Vacation Policy based upon the recognized credited service amounts of
such Transferred Employees with Seller Group.

  

  

14.9 WARN Act. Buyer represents, warrants and covenants that, there shall be
no major employment losses as a consequence of the change in ownership or
operatorship contemplated by this Agreement that might trigger obligations
under the WARN Act, or under any similar provision of any Law (collectively,
"WARN Obligations"). To the extent that any WARN Obligations might arise as a
consequence of the change in ownership or operatorship contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer covenants that Buyer Group shall be responsible for, and
Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns) shall
protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller Group from and against any
Claims caused by, arising from, incurred in connection with or relating in any
way to, any WARN Obligations arising as a result of any employment losses
occurring on or after the expiration of the Transition Period. Buyer covenants
that for ninety (90) Days following the expiration of the Transition Period,
there shall not be any mass layoff, plant closing or other action that might
trigger WARN Obligations of Seller Group. Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and
their successors and assigns) shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Seller Group from and against any Claims caused directly or
indirectly or arising from any failure to meet these obligations. These
indemnity and defense obligations apply regardless of cause or of any
negligent acts or omissions (including active or passive, sole, concurrent or
comparative negligence or gross negligence), strict liability, breach of duty
(statutory or otherwise), violation of Law or other fault of Seller Group, or
any pre-existing defect.

  

  

14.10 Service Credit. From and after the commencement of their employment with
Buyer, Buyer covenants that the Transferred Employees shall be given credit
for their service recognized by Seller Group on their last Day of employment
with Seller Group for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit
determination and accrual under all applicable plans and programs of Buyer
Group, as well as for purposes of determining any vacation, severance or other
related benefits to be provided pursuant to the manner described above.

  

  

14.11 Benefits - Miscellaneous. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Seller Group shall retain the obligation for,
and shall satisfy, payment of all covered medical, dental, life insurance and
long-term disability claims commenced or expenses incurred by any Transferred
Employee prior to the applicable Transfer Time under Section 14.4 for such
Employee, and neither the Buyer nor Buyer's Affiliates shall assume or be
responsible for any liability with respect to such claims. Buyer and Buyer's
Affiliates shall not be liable for any obligations of Seller Group arising out
of participation by Transferred Employees in the employee benefit plans of
Seller Group. All obligations described in this Section 14.11 shall be
referred to as the "Seller Employee Benefit Obligations."

  

  

14.12 Severance. Buyer covenants that Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates shall offer
severance benefits equivalent to the 2012 BP Severance Benefits Plan attached
hereto as

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

Schedule 14.12 (the "Seller Severance Plan") to any Transferred Employee who
has actions taken against such Transferred Employee within eighteen (18)
months after the expiration of the Transition Period that would make the
Transferred Employee eligible for severance benefits under the involuntary
terminations section of the Seller Severance Plan. Buyer's or Buyer's
Affiliates shall recognize the Transferred Employees' recognized credited
service amounts with Seller Group in connection with calculating the severance
benefit to be given to such Transferred Employee. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, no Party hereunder shall be liable for any
severance costs with respect to any employee of any other Party hereunder
while an employee of that other Party.

  

  

14.13 Restriction on Solicitation. Except as expressly authorized in Sections
14.2 and 14.3 and except for general published solicitations or advertisements
for employment (whether in print or on-line), for a period of twenty-four (24)
months after the Closing Date (or, if the Closing does not occur, twenty-seven
(27) months after the Signing Date), (i) neither Party may (without obtaining
the prior written consent of the other Party) solicit for employment any
employees of the other Party (or such Party's Affiliate), who are directly or
indirectly engaged in the operation of the Purchased Assets or the negotiation
or the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
Buyer may not solicit for employment any of the Excluded Employees so long as
such employee is employed by Seller or Seller's Affiliate.

  

  

14.14 Access to Employees Hired by Buyer Group. Upon written request by Seller
in connection with the Seller Retained Liabilities, Buyer shall provide access
to Employees hired by Buyer or its Affiliates, at reasonable times and in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with Buyer\'s operations.

if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 17.1, neither Party
shall have any right or remedy against the other Party as a result of such
termination, except for any breach of this Agreement and except that
performance of the indemnity obligation in Section 5.1 and the obligations
contained in Section 14.13 and Articles 17, 18 and 19 shall survive
termination of this Agreement. If Closing does not occur, Seller shall refund
the Performance Deposit to Buyer unless Closing did not occur because of
Buyer's breach of this Agreement, including breach of Buyer's representations
and warranties herein, or Buyer's failure or refusal to Close that is not
permitted by the terms of this Agreement, in any of which events Seller shall
be entitled to retain the Performance Deposit as liquidated damages and not a
penalty or Consequential Damages. The provisions for payment of the
Performance Deposit as liquidated damages in this Section 17.2 have been
included because, in the event of termination of this Agreement as described
in Section 17.1, both Buyer and Seller agree that the actual damages that
would be incurred by Seller are reasonably expected to approximate the amount
of the Performance Deposit and because the actual amount of such damages would
be difficult, if not impossible, to measure precisely and Buyer waives any
rights to claim otherwise, and Seller shall have no liability or obligation to
any member of the Buyer Group relating to or arising out of the Performance
Deposit.

  

  

17.3 Dispute over Right to Terminate. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
if the Closing fails to occur, or is rendered incapable of occurring, as a
result of the breach by such Party of any term or provision of this Agreement
(such breach, a "Closing Failure Breach"), the other Party would be damaged
irreparably. Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent any such Closing Failure
Breach and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions
hereof in

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

any action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter. If there is a dispute
between the Parties over the right of a Party to terminate this Agreement, the
Closing shall not occur on the Closing Date. A Party that disputes the right
of the other Party to terminate this Agreement may, within thirty (30) Days
after the Closing Date, initiate litigation to resolve the dispute. If the
Party that disputes the right of the other Party to terminate this Agreement
fails (for any reason whatsoever) to initiate litigation within such thirty
(30) Day period, this Agreement shall be deemed properly terminated as of the
original date of termination (without prejudice to Seller's right to retain
the Deposit together with any interest earned thereon pursuant to Section
17.2), and the Party that disputes or has the right to dispute the termination
of this Agreement, on behalf of itself, its Affiliates, and the officers,
directors, agents, employees, successors and assigns of itself and its
Affiliates, irrevocably waives any and all Claims it and they may have against
the terminating Party for termination of this Agreement.

  

  

17.4 Confidentiality. Both Parties agree to be bound by the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if each were a signatory party
thereto and to cause their respective Affiliates to comply therewith as if
they were signatories thereto. Notwithstanding the termination of this
Agreement or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary but subject
to the next sentence of this Section 17.4, the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect. If Closing of the
transaction contemplated under the terms of this Agreement occurs, the terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate (which
termination shall be effective as of the Closing) as and to the extent
provided in Section 19.4 but shall remain in full force and effect as to all
Excluded Properties and other assets, properties and information of or about
Seller Group, including the Seller Standards.

  

  

ARTICLE XVIII

  

ARBITRATION

  

  

18.1 Friendly Consultation.

  

  

18.1.1 In the event of any Arbitrable Dispute, the Parties shall attempt in
the first instance to resolve such dispute through friendly consultations
between the Parties. The Parties agree to attempt to resolve all Arbitrable
Disputes arising hereunder promptly, equitably and in a good faith manner.

  

  

18.1.2 If the Parties are unable to resolve the Arbitrable Dispute through
friendly consultation, any Party may request by written notice resolution by
management-level negotiations by the Parties. Within fifteen (15) Days after
delivery of the notice, each Party shall submit to the other Party a written
response. The notice and the response each shall include (i) a brief summary
of that Party's position and (ii) the name and title of that Party's
representative and of any other Person who will accompany the representative
to the meeting. Within fifteen (15) Days after delivery of such written
response, the representatives of both Parties (and any accompanying Persons)
shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter continue to
meet as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to use their good faith and
reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve the dispute. All negotiations
pursuant to this clause shall be confidential and

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of
applicable rules of evidence.

  

  

18.2 Arbitration.

  

  

18.2.1 an Arbitrable Dispute has not been resolved within forty-five (45) Days
after delivery of the notice requesting management-level negotiations, or if
the Parties failed to meet within fifteen (15) Days after delivery of such
notice, then the Arbitrable Dispute may be submitted by any Party to binding
arbitration pursuant to the terms of this Article 18, regardless of whether
such Arbitrable Dispute otherwise would be considered justiciable or ripe for
resolution by any court or arbitral tribunal, by giving written notice thereof
to the other Party; provided, however, that in no event shall a Party have the
right to submit the Arbitrable Dispute to arbitration if the institution of
legal or equitable proceedings based on such Arbitrable Dispute would be
barred by any applicable survival period under this Agreement or the
applicable statute of limitations. A Party submitting such Arbitrable Dispute
to binding arbitration shall do so in accordance with the AAA commercial
arbitration rules and procedures then in effect (the "AAA Rules"), with a copy
of its submission to the other Party.

  

  

18.2.2 The arbitration shall take place in Houston, Texas.

  

  

18.2.3 The submitting Party's notice initiating binding arbitration must
describe in reasonable detail the nature of the dispute and the facts and
circumstances relating thereto and identify the arbitrator it has appointed.
The other Party shall respond to the submitting Party within thirty (30) Days
after receipt of the submitting Party's notice, agreeing to the designation of
its arbitrator as the single arbitrator or identifying the arbitrator such
other Party has appointed. All arbitrators must be neutral parties who are not
and have not been an Affiliate of any Party, nor an employee, director,
officer, shareholder, owner, partner, agent or a contractor of or legal
counsel to any Party or any Affiliate of such Party or such related Persons,
either presently or at any time during the previous ten (10) years. For these
purposes, the term "neutral" shall not disqualify a Person owning securities
in mutual funds that own securities of Buyer, Seller or their respective
Affiliates. Arbitrators must have not less than fifteen (15) years experience
as a lawyer and have a legal practice that includes significant experience in
energy asset acquisition and divestiture transactions of similar complexity as
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. A single arbitrator shall
control the proceedings if appointment of a single arbitrator is accepted by
all Parties; if the Arbitrable Dispute involves Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) or less; or if the Arbitrable Dispute involves more than Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000) and the other Party fails to appoint an
arbitrator within the required thirty (30) Day period. If the Arbitrable
Dispute involves more than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) and the other
Party timely appoints an arbitrator, the arbitral tribunal shall consist of
three (3) arbitrators, comprised of the two Party-appointed arbitrators and a
third arbitrator to be appointed by the two Party-appointed arbitrators within
thirty (30) Days after the second arbitrator has been appointed. The third
arbitrator shall act as chairman of the panel. If the Arbitrable Dispute
involves Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) or less and the Parties are unable
to agree on a single arbitrator within forty-five (45) Days after the
submitting Party's notice,

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

then either Party may request the Houston, Texas office of the AAA (or, if
there is no such office, the office of the AAA serving Houston, Texas) to
select the single arbitrator, with due regard given to the selection criteria
above and input from the Parties. If the Arbitrable Dispute involves more than
Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) and the two Party-appointed arbitrators are
unable to agree on a third arbitrator within thirty (30) Days after the second
arbitrator has been appointed, then either Party may request the Houston,
Texas office of the AAA to select the third arbitrator, with due regard given
to the selection criteria above and input from the Parties. The AAA shall
select the single or third arbitrator, as the case may be, as provided in the
AAA Rules not later than thirty (30) Days after such request. In the event the
AAA should fail to select an arbitrator within such thirty (30) Day period,
then either Party may petition the Chief United States District Judge for the
Southern District of Texas to select the applicable single or third
arbitrator, as the case may be, due regard being given to the selection
criteria above and input from the Parties.

  

  

18.2.4 The arbitrators shall follow the Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in
Commercial Disputes approved by the American Bar Association House of
Delegates on February 9, 2004 and approved by the Executive Committee of the
Board of Directors of the AAA.

  

  

18.2.5 Within thirty (30) Days after the selection of the panel (whether it be
a single arbitrator or three arbitrators), each Party shall submit to the
arbitrator(s) (with copies to the other Party) such Party's position statement
and proposal for resolution of the Arbitrable Dispute, together with any
supporting data or materials. Within ten (10) Business Days after such thirty
(30) Day period, each Party shall be permitted to submit to the arbitrator(s)
(with copies to the other Party) such Party's rebuttal statement to the other
Party's position statement and a revised proposal, if any, for resolution of
the Arbitrable Dispute, together with any supporting data or materials. Within
forty-five (45) Days after the expiration of the rebuttal period, the
arbitrator(s) shall hold a hearing in Houston, Texas during which the Parties
may present argument in support of their respective proposals. The
arbitrator(s) (by majority rule if there are three (3) arbitrators) shall
determine the outcome of the Arbitrable Dispute by selecting, for each
disputed point, either the proposed resolution submitted by one Party or the
proposed resolution submitted by the other Party; provided that, if the
Parties jointly notify in writing the arbitrators of their agreement on any
particular disputed issue, the arbitrators shall follow the agreed outcome on
such issue. The arbitrators' decision shall be by majority rule if there are
three (3) arbitrators and the award shall be rendered in writing. The
arbitrators shall endeavor to render the award within sixty (60) Days
following commencement of the hearing.

  

  

18.2.6 The arbitration shall proceed under the AAA Rules and shall be governed
by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et. seq. The arbitrators
may, in their discretion, limit or expand discovery in any arbitration
proceeding as they shall determine is appropriate in the circumstances, taking
into account the needs of the disputing Parties and the desirability of making
discovery expeditious and cost-effective. The arbitrators shall also permit
the exchange of lists of exhibits and witnesses in advance of the hearing.

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

18.2.7 The decision of such arbitrators shall be final and in writing. The
Parties expressly covenant and agree to be bound by the award of the
arbitrators as a final determination of the matter in dispute, and a judgment
thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. In rendering an
award the arbitrators shall abide by (i) the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and (ii) the Laws of the State of Texas. The arbitrators shall not
have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from or alter in any way the
provisions of this Agreement or to waive, alter, amend, revoke or suspend any
of the provisions of this Agreement, provided, however, that the arbitrators
shall have the power to decide all questions with respect to the
interpretation and validity of this Section 18.2.

  

  

18.2.8 The arbitrators may award equitable relief, such as specific
performance, as well as monetary damages for any Party's breach of such
Party's obligations under this Agreement, but in no event may the arbitrators
award Consequential Damages or any other damages expressly waived in Section
8.12 or that is contrary to applicable Law.

  

  

18.2.9 All fees and costs of any arbitration will be assessed and paid, in the
absence of the disputing Parties' agreement to the contrary, equally by all
disputing Parties; provided that, the arbitrators may apportion the costs of
arbitration between the Parties in such manner as it deems reasonable, taking
into account the circumstances of the Arbitrable Dispute, the conduct of the
Parties and the result of arbitration. The arbitration panel shall be
empowered and directed to enter an award by default against any Party to the
arbitration who declines to pay when required by the arbitration panel its
share of such fees and costs. In addition, the arbitration panel shall be
entitled to award to a Party such Party's reasonable attorneys' fees and
expert fees, as determined by the arbitration panel considering those factors
mentioned in the first sentence of this Section 18.2.9, incurred in connection
with such Party's preparation for and participation in the arbitration.

  

  

18.2.10 Except to the extent required by Law or court or administrative order,
no Party, arbitrator, representative, counsel or witness shall disclose or
confirm to any Person not present at the negotiation or arbitration any
information about the negotiation or arbitration proceeding or hearings,
including the names of the parties and the arbitrators, the nature and amount
of the claims, the financial condition of any party, the expected date of the
hearing or the award made.

  

  

18.2.11 To the extent, the Arbitrable Dispute arises in whole or in part under
Article 5 or Article 7 of this Agreement, this Article 18 shall apply to the
extent amended by such Article.

  

  

18.2.12 Notwithstanding the other provisions set forth in this Article 18, a
court of competent jurisdiction may issue a pre-arbitral injunction, pre-
arbitral attachment, or other order in aid of arbitration proceedings and the
enforcement of any award. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as
may be available under the jurisdiction of a court, the arbitration panel
shall have full authority to grant

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

provisional remedies and to direct the Parties to request that any court
modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court.

  

  

18.3 Continuing Obligations and Rights. When any Arbitrable Dispute occurs,
the Parties shall continue to make payments of undisputed amounts in
accordance with this Agreement, and the Parties shall otherwise continue to
exercise their respective rights, and fulfill their respective obligations,
under this Agreement. While any friendly consultations or arbitration are
pending, no Party shall exercise any other remedies hereunder arising by
virtue of the matters in dispute; provided, however, a Party's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 17 shall not be suspended during
the pendency of any friendly consultations or arbitration.

  

  

18.4 Interim Remedies. Before a notice to arbitrate is given or prior to the
selection of the arbitrator(s), nothing contained herein shall prevent a Party
from applying to a court that would otherwise have jurisdiction for
provisional or interim measures. After the arbitrator(s) has been selected,
the arbitrator(s) shall have sole jurisdiction to hear such applications,
except that any measures ordered by the arbitrator(s) may be immediately and
specifically enforced by a court otherwise having jurisdiction over the
Parties.

19.2 Costs and Post-Closing Consents. Notwithstanding other provisions of this
Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for recording and filing documents
associated with the assignment of the applicable Properties to it and for all
costs and fees associated therewith, including filing the assignments and
deed(s) with appropriate Governmental Authorities as required by applicable
Law. Buyer shall also be responsible for the payment of any and all transfer,
Sales, gross receipts, use or similar Taxes or assessments resulting from its
acquisition of Properties as contemplated by this Agreement. As soon as
practicable after recording or filing, Buyer shall furnish Seller with all
recording data and evidence of all required filings. Buyer shall also be
responsible for obtaining Customary Post-Closing Consents applicable to the
Properties acquired by it under this Agreement and all costs and fees
associated therewith. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, all fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in negotiating
this Agreement and in consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid in full by the Party that incurred such fees, costs
and expenses.

  

  

19.3 Records.

  

  

19.3.1 Seller and Buyer shall meet within thirty (30) Business Days after the
Closing Date and from time to time thereafter in order to plan an orderly
transition of the Records to Buyer. Within a commercially reasonable period
(which is anticipated to be at least one hundred twenty (120) Days after the
end of the Transition Period), Seller shall make available for Buyer to pick
up or for Buyer to have delivered (at Buyer's sole expense) to a location of
Buyer's choice the Records that are maintained by Seller or its Affiliates
(or, in the case of Records located at the Properties, make such Records
available to Buyer at such locations); provided, however, Seller may retain
copies or originals of any or all Records. If Seller retains originals of
Records under this Section 19.3, Seller will deliver to Buyer scanned
electronic copies of such original Records at Seller's expense.

  

  

19.3.2 Seller is not obligated to create any Records for Buyer or to provide
Records in a form or format other than the form or format in which they exist
as

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

of the Signing Date or to provide them to Buyer in any sequence or priority.
Seller will provide the Records to Buyer in the formats and on media used by
Seller, or native to the system in which such data or information resides. If
Seller has any Records in an electronic format, Seller will deliver such
Records in such electronic format. If Buyer requests any Records in a specific
format or report form and Seller is able, with Commercially Reasonable
Efforts, to provide such Records in such requested format or report form,
Buyer will reimburse Seller for all costs incurred by Seller related to the
provision of such Records in such requested format or report form.

  

  

19.3.3 If Buyer desires to have copies of Records prior to the time by which
Seller is obligated to furnish the Records to Buyer under this Section 19.3,
Seller will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the copies requested
by Buyer to be made and delivered to Buyer; provided, however, that Seller has
no obligation to provide Buyer with copies of Records prior to Closing and if
Seller is willing to provide copies of any such Records prior to Closing,
Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all costs of copying and providing such
Records to Buyer. The provisions of this Section 19.3.3 are without prejudice
to Buyer's rights under Sections 4.1 and 5.1.

  

  

19.3.4 Buyer shall maintain the Records received from Seller for seven (7)
years after the Closing Date and afford Seller reasonable access to the
Records and a right to copy the Records at Seller's expense as reasonably
requested by Seller. Buyer may retain the Records in electronic format in its
ordinary course of business. If Buyer desires to destroy the Records within
such seven (7) year period, it shall notify Seller prior to such destruction,
and provide Seller an opportunity to take possession of them at Seller's
expense. In addition, Buyer shall afford Seller full access to records and
data produced after the Closing Date and reasonably requested by Seller in
connection with any Claim for indemnity by Buyer under this Agreement
(excluding, however, attorney work product and attorney-client communications
entitled to legal privilege), and a right to copy such records and data at
Seller's expense. Furthermore, Seller shall afford Buyer full access to
records and data which have not been delivered to Buyer and which are
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with any Claim for which Buyer is
responsible under this Agreement (excluding, however, attorney work product
and attorney-client communications entitled to legal privilege), and a right
to copy such records and data at Seller's Expense if such records or data
should have been delivered to Buyer as Records, and, in all other cases, at
Buyer's expense.

  

  

19.4 Post-Closing Confidentiality of Records. Effective upon the execution of
this Agreement, Buyer hereby ratifies the Confidentiality Agreement and agrees
to be subject thereto, as if each entity comprising Buyer was a signatory
hereto. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing with respect to a
particular Property:

  

  

19.4.1 with respect to such information to the extent that it relates solely
to such Property and liabilities assumed with respect thereto, (x) Buyer shall
have no further obligations of confidentiality to Seller under the
Confidentiality Agreement in respect thereof and (y), except to the extent
related to the enforcement of its rights or defense of its obligations under
this Agreement, Seller hereby agrees to treat such information insofar as it
pertains solely to such Property and assumed liabilities with

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

  

respect thereto as confidential information of Buyer in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; and

  

  

19.4.2 with respect to such information to the extent that it does not relate
solely to such Property and liabilities assumed with respect thereto, such
information shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement on and after the Closing Date, and Buyer hereby
acknowledges its obligation to treat such information as confidential
information of Seller in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

  

19.5 GAAP/Financial Reporting. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all accounting matters under this Agreement shall be determined in
accordance with GAAP. With respect to each Party's financial reporting
obligations, Buyer shall commence reporting production and revenues from the
Properties effective as of the Closing Date, unless otherwise required by
GAAP.

  

  

19.6 Further Assurances.

  

  

19.6.1 From and after Closing, at the request of Seller but without further
consideration, Buyer shall execute and deliver or use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to cause to be executed and delivered such other instruments of
conveyance and take such other actions as Seller reasonably may request to
more effectively put Seller in possession of any Property that was not
intended to be (i) a Property or (ii) conveyed or was conveyed in error by the
Parties (including reassignment from Buyer to Seller of any Property that was
conveyed in violation of valid preferential purchase rights or material
consents to assignment), or to more effectively implement Buyer's assumption
of obligations under Section 12.3. From and after Closing, at the request of
Buyer but without further consideration, Seller shall execute and deliver or
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause to be executed and delivered such
other instruments of conveyance and take such other actions as Buyer
reasonably may request to more effectively put Buyer in possession of any
Properties conveyed or to have been conveyed to Buyer in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

  

  

19.6.2 Except to the extent constituting Excluded Properties, Seller and Buyer
agree that it is the intent of the Parties that Seller assign and convey to
Buyer all of the upstream oil and gas assets and midstream assets owned by
Seller, which were reflected in the financial information provided to Buyer in
the Data Room or were, as of the Effective Time, located in Finney, Grant,
Hamilton, Haskell, Kearny, Morton, Seward, Stevens and Stanton Counties,
Kansas.

  

  

19.7 Extent of Indemnification. Without limiting or enlarging the scope of the
indemnification, defense, release, disclaimer and assumption provisions set
forth in this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, an
indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder in
accordance with the terms hereof, regardless of whether the indemnifiable loss
giving rise to any such indemnification obligation is the result of the active
or passive, sole, concurrent or comparative negligence or gross negligence,
strict

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

  

liability, breach of duty (statutory or otherwise), or other fault or
violation of any Law of or by any such indemnified Person, or any pre-existing
defect.

  

  

19.8 Amendments and Severability. No amendments, waivers or other
modifications of this Agreement will be effective or binding on either of the
Parties unless the same are in writing, designated as an amendment or
modification, and signed by both Parties. The invalidity of any one or more
provisions of this Agreement will not affect the validity of this Agreement as
a whole, and in case of any such invalidity, this Agreement will be construed
as if the invalid provision had not been included herein.

  

  

19.9 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and all of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned (by operation of Law or otherwise) prior to the Closing Date by
either of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Party;
provided, however, that Buyer may assign this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests or obligations hereunder to a wholly-owned Affiliate of such Party.
Assignment shall not relieve the assignor of liability hereunder. In the event
Buyer or any subsequent (direct or indirect) assignee of Buyer assigns this
Agreement or any of its rights or interests under Article 8 of this Purchase
Agreement to a Third Party (by operation of law or otherwise), Buyer or its
subsequent assignee, as applicable, shall no longer have any rights to make a
claim for indemnification under Article 8 following such assignment.

  

  

19.10 Headings and Exhibits. The headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only, shall not constitute a part of this Agreement,
and are in no way to be construed as a limitation on the scope of particular
sections to which they refer. Information set forth in any Exhibit or Schedule
to this Agreement is deemed to have been disclosed for all purposes of this
Agreement.

  

  

19.11 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.

  

  

19.11.1 This Agreement (including administration of the arbitration provisions
set forth in Article 18) shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the substantive Laws of the State of Texas, without regard to
its conflict of laws rules or principles.

  

  

19.11.2 The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the state and federal courts located in Harris County, Texas in connection
with any dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement, the Operative
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, that is
permitted to be commenced in court, and each Party irrevocably agrees that all
Claims in respect of such dispute or proceeding that is permitted to be
commenced in court shall be heard and determined exclusively in such courts.
The Parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the venue of any dispute
arising under or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum
for the maintenance of

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

79  

  

 

 

 

  

such dispute. Each Party agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

  

  

19.11.3 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party hereby
waives any right to a trial by jury of any claim or cause of action based upon
or arising out of or related to this Agreement, the other Operative Documents,
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, in any action, proceeding
or other litigation of any type brought by any of the Parties against any
other Party, whether with respect to contract claims, tort claims, or
otherwise. The Parties each agree that any such claim or cause of action shall
be tried by a court trial without a jury. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Parties further agree that their respective right to a trial by jury is waived
by operation of this Section 19.11 as to any action, counterclaim or other
proceeding which seeks, in whole or in part, to challenge the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or the other Operative Documents or any
provision hereof or thereof.

  

  

19.11.4 Each Party represents, covenants and warrants that it is subject to
service of process in the State of Texas and that it will remain so subject so
long as this Agreement remains in effect. If, for any reason, a Party should
not be so subject, it hereby designates and appoints, without power of
revocation, the Secretary of State of the State of Texas as such Party's agent
upon whom may be served all process, pleadings, notices or other papers which
may be served upon such Party as a result of any of its obligations under this
Agreement.

  

  

19.12 No Partnership Created. It is not the purpose or intention of this
Agreement to create (and it should not be construed as creating) a joint
venture, partnership or any type of association, and the Parties are not
authorized to act as an agent or principal for each other with respect to any
matter related hereto. Nothing contained in this Agreement prevents either
Buyer or Seller from engaging in any business or purchasing any asset, whether
or not in the vicinity of the Properties or in competition with the business
of the other.

  

  

19.13 Public Announcements. Seller (on behalf of Seller Group) and Buyer (on
behalf of Buyer Group) agree not to issue any public statement or press
release concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including price or other terms) without the prior written consent of the
other Party, and then only after prior reasonable consultation with the other
Party regarding the timing and content of the statement; provided, however, if
Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other is required by Law or the
rules of the New York Stock Exchange or another securities exchange to make a
public announcement or statement, then the same may be made without the
approval of the other Party so long as the other Party is provided reasonable
advance notice and with the further understanding that the Party not required
to make any such announcement or statement shall have the right to issue its
own announcement or statement in connection with or in response to any such
required public announcement or statement.

  

  

19.14 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing contained in this Agreement
entitles any Person other than Seller and Buyer or their permitted successors
and assigns to any

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

Claim, remedy or right of any kind whatsoever, except with respect to waivers
and indemnities that expressly provide for waivers or indemnification of Buyer
Group, Seller Group or another Person, in which case members of such groups
and such other Persons are considered third party beneficiaries for the sole
purposes of those waiver and indemnity provisions. The immediately preceding
sentence notwithstanding, any claim for indemnity or defense under this
Agreement shall only be brought and administered by a Party to this Agreement.
Each Party may elect to exercise or not exercise the indemnification and
defense rights under this Agreement on behalf of any member of the Buyer Group
or Seller Group, as applicable, and no member of any such group shall have any
rights under this Agreement except to the extent exercised on its or his
behalf. For the avoidance of doubt, there will be no third party beneficiaries
under this Agreement for breaches of Article 14.

  

  

19.15 Waiver of Consumer Rights. As partial consideration for the Parties
entering into this Agreement, each Party can and does hereby waive the
provisions of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Consumer Protection Act,
Article 17.41 et. seq., Texas Business and Commerce Code, a law that gives
consumers special rights and protection, and all other consumer protection
Laws of the State of Texas, or of any other state that may be applicable to
this transaction, that may be waived by such Party. It is not the intent of
either Party to waive and neither Party does waive any Law or provision
thereof that is prohibited by Law from being waived. Each Party represents
that it has had an adequate opportunity to review the preceding waiver
provision, including the opportunity to submit the same to legal counsel for
review and advice and after consultation with an attorney of its own selection
voluntarily consents to this waiver, and understands the rights being waived
herein.

  

  

19.16 Not to be Construed Against Drafter. The Parties acknowledge that they
have had an adequate opportunity to review each and every provision contained
in this Agreement and to submit the same to legal counsel for review and
comment. Based on the foregoing, the Parties agree that the rule of
construction that a contract be construed against the drafter, if any, not be
applied in the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

  

  

19.17 Possible Exchange. Seller reserves the right to structure the
transactions contemplated under the terms of this Agreement as a non-
simultaneous like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code, and its
implementing Treasury Regulations. In connection with effectuating a non-
simultaneous like-kind exchange, Seller reserves the right, at or prior to the
Closing Date or any subsequent closing, to assign its rights under this
Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary (as that term is defined in
§1.103(k)-1(g)(4) of the Treasury Regulations) or to a Qualified Exchange
Accommodation Titleholder (as that term is defined in Revenue Procedure
2000-37) notwithstanding Section 19.9. In addition, should Seller choose to
structure a non-simultaneous like-kind exchange, the Parties agree to execute
all documents reasonably necessary to effectuate the non-simultaneous like-
kind exchange; provided that Buyer shall incur no additional costs, expenses,
fees or liabilities as a result of or in connection with the exchange
requested by the Seller. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that any
assignment of rights under this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary or an
Exchange Accommodation Titleholder shall not release either Party from any of
its liabilities and obligations to the other Party under this Agreement, and
that neither Party represents to the other Party that any particular Tax
treatment will be given to any Party as a result thereof. In no event will
either Party be liable to

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

  

the other for any failure of any transaction to qualify for like-kind
treatment under Section 1031 of the Code.

  

  

19.18 Schedules. With respect to the representations and warranties of each
Party contained in this Agreement, such Party shall have the right until two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing to supplement or modify such Party's
Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if
existing or known on the Signing Date, would have been required to be set
forth or described in such Party's Schedule; provided, however that for all
purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in Article 15 have been fulfilled or whether an
obligation has arisen under Article VIII, the Schedules shall be deemed to
exclude all information contained in any supplement or modification thereto.
Certain information set forth in the Schedules is included solely for
informational purposes, and the specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of
any specific item in the Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts
(or higher or lower amounts) are or are not material, and no Party shall use
the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any
such item in the Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the Parties
as to whether any obligation, item, or matter not described herein or included
in a Schedule is or is not required to be disclosed or is or is not material
for purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

19.19 Supplementation of Exhibits. The Parties agree and acknowledge that,
Exhibits "A-1" through "A-6" and, "B" to this Agreement may be incorrect,
incomplete or subject to revision to include additional or supplemental
information prior to the Closing. As soon as practicable, but no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, Seller shall have the right to
deliver to Buyer a replacement for Exhibits "A-1" through "A-6" and, "B";
provided, however, such replacement Exhibits must be consistent with Section
19.6.2. Prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller shall reach agreement in writing
upon the form and content of each such replacement Exhibits, consent by each
Party not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

19.20 Acknowledgement of Parties; Conspicuousness. EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES (1) THAT IT HAS A DUTY TO READ THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT
IT IS CHARGED WITH NOTICE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TERMS HEREOF, AND (2) THAT IT
HAS IN FACT READ THIS AGREEMENT AND IS FULLY INFORMED AND HAS FULL NOTICE AND
KNOWLEDGE OF THE TERMS, CONDITIONS AND EFFECTS OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
FURTHER AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT CONTEST THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY
SUCH PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT ON THE BASIS THAT THE PARTY HAD NO NOTICE OR
KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH PROVISIONS OR THAT SUCH PROVISIONS ARE NOT "CONSPICUOUS".
The Parties expressly hereby acknowledge and agree that the provisions
contained in this Agreement that are set out in "bold" or in "ALL CAPS"
satisfy the requirement of the "express negligence rule" and any other
requirement at law or in equity that provisions contained in a contract be
conspicuously marked or highlighted.

  

  

19.21 Waiver of Compliance. Any failure of Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer,
on the other hand, to comply with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition contained in

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

82  

  

 

 

 

  

this Agreement may be expressly waived in writing by the non-failing Party,
but, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, such waiver or failure to
insist upon strict compliance shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

  

  

19.22 Entire Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement and this Agreement
(including the Exhibits, Schedules, and other documents and ancillary
agreements referred to herein, which form a part of this Agreement) embodies
the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties in respect of the
subject matter contained herein and therein and, except as otherwise provided
in Section 17.4, supersedes all prior and contemporaneous negotiations,
understandings, letters of intent, and agreements (whether oral or written)
between the Parties or their Affiliates relating to the terms of purchase and
sale of the Properties and constitute the entire understanding and agreement
between the Parties with respect to the sale, assignment and conveyance of the
Properties and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There are no
restrictions, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, other than those expressly
set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

  

  

19.23 Conflicts. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
Agreement and the Operative Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall
control. Nothing in the Operative Documents shall be deemed to expand,
diminish or otherwise modify the rights or obligations of the Parties as
expressed in the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

19.24 Time of Essence. Time is of the essence with respect to all provisions
of this Agreement that specify a time for performance; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not be construed to limit or deprive a Party of the
benefits of any grace or cure period allowed in this Agreement.

  

  

19.25 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or
more counterparts (including by means of facsimile or email of a portable
document format (pdf) of the signature pages), each of which shall be deemed
to be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument.

  

  

19.26 Financial Statements.

  

  

19.26.1 After the Signing Date, Buyer, at Buyer's expense, may engage Ernst and
Young to conduct an audit of the revenues and expenses (and other SEC required
disclosures) of Seller attributable to the Properties for a period prior to
the Effective Time through the Closing Date, such period to be determined by
SEC requirements. In that regard, prior to Closing, Seller shall provide Ernst
and Young reasonable access to its records related to the Properties (to the
extent such information is available) and personnel of Seller as Ernst and Young
may reasonably request in order to conduct such audit at Buyer\'s sole cost
and expense. At all times prior to Closing, Buyer shall cause Ernst and Young
not to share with Buyer or its Affiliates information related to, arising out
of, or derived from Ernst and Young's review and audit of Seller's records.
After Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer reasonable access to its records
related to the Properties (to the extent such information is available) and
personnel of Seller as Buyer may reasonably request to enable Buyer, and its
representatives and accountants, at

  

 

 

 

  

HOUSTON 1139976v.13

 

  

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

  

Buyer\'s sole cost and expense, to audit any records that Buyer reasonably
deems necessary. The Parties shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
complete such audit prior to April 30, 2012. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) Seller shall in no event be required to create new records relating to the
Properties and (ii) the access to be provided to Buyer pursuant to this
Section shall not interfere with Seller's ability to prepare its own financial
statements or its regular conduct of business and shall be made available
during Seller's normal business hours.

  

  

19.26.2 Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Group and their successors and assigns)
releases Seller Group from and shall fully protect, defend, indemnify and hold
Seller Group harmless from and against any and all Claims relating to, arising
out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, the preparation or
furnishing of any information or records referred to in this Section 19.26,
any actions, statements, representations or certifications of Seller's and its
Affiliates' personnel, accountants, consultants, contractors or auditors with
respect to such information or records, or Buyer's use of any such information
or records, the inclusion of any such records or information or matters
derived therefrom, in any debt or equity offering documents, filings with any
exchange or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or related materials,
regardless of cause or of any negligent acts or omissions (including active or
passive, sole, concurrent or comparative negligence or gross negligence),
strict liability, breach of duty (statutory or otherwise), violation of Law,
or other fault of Seller Group, or any pre-existing defect.
