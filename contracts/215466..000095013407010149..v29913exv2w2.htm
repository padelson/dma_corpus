terminate this agreement without, any liability to the other party because of

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

     (b)  |   | Waiver: A waiver of a breach or non-fulfilment in

     3.7  |   | Regulatory approval  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | For the purposes of clause 3.1(a), a Regulatory Approval will

having been obtained.  
      
  3.8  |   | Change of status  
      
    |   | The parties agree that a general meeting of Bolnisi

  (a)  |   | Subject to this clause 4.2, Coeur undertakes and warrants to

of the Scheme Shareholders) that in consideration of the transfer to Coeur
Australia of each Scheme Share under the terms of the Scheme, Coeur will
accept such transfer and provide the Scheme Consideration to the
Scheme Shareholders in accordance with the terms of the Scheme.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

     (b)  |   | Subject to customary provisions which address share
splitting or division in an attempt to obtain advantage by reference to
rounding, any fractional entitlement of an Ordinary Shareholder to a Coeur
Share will be rounded up in the case of any entitlement to half of a Coeur
Share or otherwise rounded up or down to the nearest whole number of Coeur
Shares.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (c)  |   | Where an Ordinary Shareholder is an Ineligible Overseas
Shareholder in relation to the issue of Coeur Shares, the number of Coeur
Shares (or, at the election of the nominee, CDIs representing Coeur Shares)
to which the Ordinary Shareholder would otherwise be entitled under the
Scheme will be issued to a nominee appointed by agreement between Bolnisi and
Coeur who will sell those Coeur Shares or CDIs representing Coeur Shares as
soon as practicable and in any event not more than 28 days after the
Implementation Date (at the risk of that Ineligible Overseas Shareholder) and
remit to Bolnisi the proceeds received, after deducting any applicable
brokerage, costs, taxes and charges, to that Ineligible Overseas Shareholder
in full satisfaction of that Ineligible Overseas Shareholders rights in
relation to Coeur Shares or CDIs representing Coeur Shares under the
Scheme.  
      
  4.3  |   | Status of Coeur Shares  
      
  (a)  |   | The Coeur Shares to be issued by Coeur as part of the Scheme
Consideration will rank pari passu with all existing Coeur Shares then
outstanding and will be fully paid and issued free from any mortgage, charge,
lien, encumbrance or other security interest.  
      
  (b)  |   | The Coeur Shares will be issued pursuant to an exemption from
registration provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the United States Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). In the event that the exemption from
registration under Section 3(a)(10) of the 1933 Act is not available for any
reason to exempt the issuance of the Coeur Shares in accordance with
the Scheme from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act, then Coeur
shall take all necessary action to file a registration statement on Form S-4
(or on such other form that may be available to Coeur) in order to register
such Coeur Shares and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
registration statement to become effective at or prior to the Implementation
Date. Bolnisi acknowledges that the Coeur Shares issued to "affiliates"
(as defined under Rule 144 of the 1933 Act) of Bolnisi may be resold in the
manner permitted by Rules 145(c) and (d) of the 1933 Act.  
      
  4.4  |   | Dividends

Bolnisi may not without the prior written consent of Coeur, pay or declare
any dividends.  
      
  4.5  |   | Withholding rights  
      
    |   | Coeur, Coeur Sub, Coeur Australia, and Bolnisi shall each be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any Scheme Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to the terms of this agreement and the Scheme such amounts
as it is required or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to such
payment under the tax laws of any jurisdiction. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
hereof as having been paid to the holder of the Ordinary Shares in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld
amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.

     12.4  |   | Normal provision of information

any of their respective directors to do or refrain from doing any thing with

breach of clause 12.1(a)), provided that the Bolnisi or Coeur Board (as
applicable) has determined in good faith and acting reasonably after
consultation with its financial advisers and receiving written legal advice
from external legal advisers, that failing to respond to such Third Party
Proposal would be likely to constitute a breach of the directors fiduciary
or statutory obligations.

  13.1  |   | Background

this agreement and the Scheme is subsequently not implemented, they will both
incur significant costs.  
      
  (b)  |   | Each party has requested that provision be made for the
payments outlined in clauses 13.2 and 13.4, without which they would not have
entered into this agreement.  
      
  (c)  |   | Each party considers that this clause is fair and reasonable
and that it is appropriate to agree to the payments referred to in this
clause 13 in order to secure the significant benefits to it (and its
shareholders) resulting from the Transaction.  
      
  13.2  |   | Payment of costs  
      
  (a)  |   | If this agreement is terminated or the Scheme is not
implemented as a result of:  
   

  

       | (1)  |   | the non-satisfaction of any conditions precedent
in clauses 3.1(b), 3.1(h), 3.1(j), 3.1(l) or 3.1(n) provided that,
immediately before the termination or, if the agreement has not been
terminated, when Court approval was due to be sought, no matter has occurred
which would prevent clauses 3.1(a), 3.1(c), 3.1(f), 3.1(g), 3.1(i) or 3.1(k)
from being satisfied;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | Bolnisi not using its best endeavours to cause clauses
3.1(b) or 3.1(e) to be satisfied, provided that all other conditions
precedent have been or are reasonably likely to be satisfied;  
      
    | (3)  |   | any Bolnisi Board member withdrawing or changing his
recommendation or supporting a Third Party Proposal for Bolnisi;  
      
    | (4)  |   | a Third Party Proposal for Bolnisi being announced or
made before the Second Court Date and, within 7 months of the date of this
agreement, the person making the Third Party Proposal for Bolnisi acquiring
voting power of 50% or more in Bolnisi; or  
      
    | (5)  |   | Bolnisi breaching its obligations under clause 12,  
   

  

       |   | Bolnisi must pay to Coeur the Break Fee to compensate
Coeur for the costs and disbursements incurred by Coeur and the time invested
by the management and board of Coeur.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (b)  |   | If this agreement is terminated or the Scheme is not
implemented as a result of:  
   

  

       | (1)  |   | the non-satisfaction of the conditions precedent
in clauses 3.1(c), 3.1(g), 3.1(i) 3.1(k), 3.1(m) or 3.1(o) provided that,
immediately before the termination or, if the agreement has not been
terminated when Court approval was due to be sought, no matter has occurred
which would prevent clauses 3.1(a), 3.1(f), 3.1(h), 3.1(j) or 3.1(l) from
being satisfied; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | Coeur not using its best endeavours to cause clause
3.1(m) to be satisfied, provided that all other conditions precedent have
been or are reasonably likely to be satisfied;

Bolnisi for the costs and disbursements incurred by Bolnisi and the time
invested by the management and board of Bolnisi.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (c)  |   | Since the loss which would actually be incurred by the
parties of the kinds referred to in clauses 13.2(a) to 13.2(b) are of such
nature that they cannot accurately be ascertained in advance, the Break Fee
has been agreed as a genuine and reasonable pre-estimate of the loss which
may be suffered by Bolnisi and Coeur respectively.  
      
  (d)  |   | Bolnisi must pay Coeur the Break Fee claimed under clause
13.2(a) within 10 Business Days of receipt by Bolnisi of a demand for payment
of the Break Fee from Coeur.  
      
  (e)  |   | Coeur must pay Bolnisi the Break Fee claimed under clause
13.2(b) within 10 Business Days of receipt by Coeur of a demand for payment
of the Break Fee from Bolnisi.  
      
  13.3  |   | Exceptions  
      
    |   | Neither party will have an obligation to pay the Break Fee
under clause 13.2(a) or 13.2(b) if:  
      
  (a)  |   | this agreement is terminated pursuant to clause 8.3; or  
      
  (b)  |   | the Independent Expert determines in its report that the
Scheme is not in the best interests of the Ordinary Shareholders, unless such
determination is as a result of a Third Party Proposal for Bolnisi.  
      
  13.4  |   | Compliance with law  
      
    |   | This clause 13 imposes obligations on Bolnisi only to the
extent that the performance of those obligations would not:  
      
  (a)  |   | involve a breach of the fiduciary duties owed by any Bolnisi
director; or  
      
  (b)  |   | breach an order of the Takeovers Panel; or  
      
  (c)  |   | otherwise be unlawful or contravene any court or regulatory
order.  
      
  13.5  |   | Limitation of liability  
      
    |   | Notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement:  
      
  (a)  |   | a payment under this clause 13 represents the sole and
absolute liability of the parties under or in connection with the occurrence
of any of the events or circumstances referred to in clauses 13.2(a) to
13.2(b) and no further claims for damages, fees, expenses or reimbursements
of any kind will be payable by a party which has paid the Break Fee
in connection with the occurrence of any such events or circumstances; and  
      
  (b)  |   | the sum of the Break Fee represents the maximum liability of
each party to the other under or in connection with this agreement, including
any breach by it or the representations and warranties herein.

  (a)  |   | In this clause 16, a word or expression defined in the _A New

it in that Act.  
      
  (b)  |   | If a party makes a supply under or in connection with this

is made.  
      
  (c)  |   | If a party must reimburse or indemnify another party for a
loss, cost or expense, the amount to be reimbursed or indemnified is first
reduced by any input tax credit the other party is entitled to for the loss,
cost or expense, and then increased in accordance with clause 16(b).
