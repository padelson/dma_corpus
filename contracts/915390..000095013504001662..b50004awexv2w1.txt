Directors of Parent, Metrocall Acquiring Sub and Metrocall have approved the
merger of Metrocall Acquiring Sub with and into Metrocall (the "Metrocall

stockholders that the Metrocall Merger be consummated, and the respective
Boards of Directors of Parent, Arch Acquiring Sub and Arch have approved the
merger of Arch Acquiring Sub with and into Arch (the "Arch Merger", and
together with the Metrocall Merger, the "Merger") and have deemed it
advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders that the
Arch Merger be consummated, in each case upon the terms and subject to the

and, in the case of certain holders of Metrocall Common Stock, cash, all as
described in Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder; and   WHEREAS,
the parties hereto desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Transactions").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the mutual representations, warranties and covenants contained herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   Section 1.1

amended to reflect a change in such name as determined by the Parent Board.
From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, Metrocall shall (a)

Acquiring Sub and Arch Acquiring Sub to perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement, and (c) take all action necessary to ensure that, prior

Acquiring Sub conducts any business or makes any investment other than
as contemplated by this Agreement or as may otherwise be agreed to by Arch
in writing.   (b) The Metrocall Merger. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in

terms and as provided in the DGCL, except that references to the name of the
Surviving Metrocall Corporation shall be amended to reflect a change in such
name as determined by the Parent Board.   (b) The certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Arch Corporation shall be amended as of the
Effective Time such that it is identical to the certificate of incorporation

the DGCL, except that references to the name of the Surviving Arch
Corporation shall be amended to reflect a change in such name as determined
by the Parent Board.   Section 1.4 Bylaws. (a) The bylaws of the Surviving
Metrocall Corporation shall be amended as of the Effective Time such that
they are identical to the bylaws of Metrocall Acquiring Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (subject to Section 6.9 hereof)
thereafter may be amended in accordance with their terms and as provided by
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Metrocall Corporation and
the DGCL, except that references to the name of the Surviving Metrocall
Corporation shall be amended to reflect a change in such name as determined

foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time:   (a) all of the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Metrocall and

franchises of Arch and Arch Acquiring Sub shall vest in the Surviving Arch

Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. (a) Metrocall Common Stock. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Metrocall Merger and without any action
on the part of any holder of capital stock of Metrocall or any holder of
capital stock of Metrocall Acquiring Sub:   (i) (A) Subject to Sections
2.1(a)(ii), 2.1(a)(v), 2.3, 2.4 and 2.10, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Metrocall ("Metrocall Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to which an
election has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to
Section 2.3 or deemed made pursuant to Section 2.4 (collectively, the
"Electing Shares") shall be converted into the right to receive an amount
equal to $75.00 (the "Cash Election Price"), in cash, without interest. (B)
Subject to Sections 2.1(a)(ii), 2.1(a)(v), 2.3, 2.4 and 2.10, each share of
Metrocall Common Stock (other than Electing Shares) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive 1.876 shares (the "Metrocall Exchange Ratio") of common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"). The shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued and cash payable upon the conversion of
shares of Metrocall Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(i) and cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by
Section 2.10 are referred to collectively as "Metrocall Merger
Consideration". All shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this
Section 2.1(a)(i) shall be duly authorized, validly issued and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership of
such shares. All shares of Metrocall Common Stock converted into shares of
Parent Common Stock or cash pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(i) shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly representing
any such shares shall cease to have any rights, except the right to receive
cash, Parent Common Stock to be issued and cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.10, in consideration
for   -4-  such shares upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with this Article II, without interest.   (ii) All shares of
Metrocall Common Stock that are owned by Metrocall as treasury stock and any
shares of Metrocall Common Stock owned by Arch or any Subsidiary of Arch
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares under any existing
employee benefit plan which are held by either Company as trustee, shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no share capital of Parent
or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefore.   (iii)
Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Metrocall Acquiring
Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Metrocall
Corporation.   (iv) If any shares of Metrocall Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
Metrocall, then any shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such
shares of Metrocall Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the
same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the
certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly
be marked with appropriate legends, except that this Section 2.1(a)(iv) shall
not apply to any such shares that, pursuant to the terms of the applicable
agreement, certificate or other governing instrument, would otherwise be
vested or freed of such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition as a result of the Transactions. Metrocall shall take all action
that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set
forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.  
(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Metrocall Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies
in all respects with, Section 262 ("Section 262") of the DGCL ("Appraisal
Shares") shall not be converted into Metrocall Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.1(a)(i), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in
accordance with Section 262; provided, however, that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to no longer be Appraisal Shares and, instead, shall
be deemed to be Non-Electing Shares, to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, Metrocall Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a)(i).  
(b) Metrocall Stock Options, Warrants and Unissued Shares Under the Metrocall
Plan of Reorganization. (i) Metrocall Stock Options. At the Effective Time,
all options to purchase shares of Metrocall Common Stock (each, a "Metrocall
Stock Option") which are then outstanding and unexercised shall cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of Metrocall Common Stock and shall
be converted automatically into an option to acquire, on the   -5-  same
terms and conditions as were otherwise applicable under the Metrocall
Stock Option, shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth below. From and
after the Effective Time (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
purchasable upon exercise of each outstanding converted Metrocall Stock
Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Metrocall
Common Stock that were purchasable upon exercise of such converted Metrocall
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Metrocall
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock,
and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock under each
converted Metrocall Stock Option shall be obtained by dividing (x) the
exercise price per share of Metrocall Common Stock of such converted
Metrocall Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the
Metrocall Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest cent; provided,
however, that in the case of any Metrocall Stock Option to which Section 421
of the Code, applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the
Code, the exercise price per share, the number of shares subject to such
Metrocall Stock Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of
such Metrocall Stock Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with
the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Unless otherwise elected
by Metrocall prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall assume
Metrocall\'s obligations with respect to each outstanding Metrocall Stock
Option in such manner that Parent (i) is a corporation "assuming a stock
option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) applies" within the meaning
of Section 424 of the Code or (ii) to the extent that Section 424 of the Code
does not apply to such Metrocall Stock Option, would be such a corporation
were Section 424 of the Code applicable to such Metrocall Stock Option; and,
if not so otherwise elected, after the Effective Time, all references to
Metrocall in the Metrocall Option Plan and the applicable Metrocall Stock
Option agreements shall be deemed to refer to Parent, which shall have
assumed the Metrocall Option Plan as of the Effective Time by virtue of this
Agreement and without any further action on the part of Parent or Metrocall.
Each Metrocall Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth
in the Metrocall Option Plan and such Metrocall Stock Option as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Metrocall and Arch shall use, and
shall cause Parent to use, all reasonable efforts to ensure that Metrocall
Stock Options intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Section
422 of the Code prior to the Effective Time continue to so qualify after the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Metrocall Board shall
take, or shall cause its committees to take, all action necessary to
effectuate the foregoing.   (i) Metrocall Warrants. At the Effective Time,
all warrants to purchase shares of Metrocall Common Stock (each, a "Metrocall
Warrant") which are then outstanding and unexercised shall no longer be
exercisable for Metrocall Common Stock and shall thereafter be exercisable
for Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable Metrocall Warrants. From and after the Effective Time (i) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of each
outstanding converted Metrocall Warrant shall be equal to the product of (x)
the number of shares of Metrocall Common Stock that were purchasable upon
exercise of such converted Metrocall Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) the Metrocall Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock under each converted Metrocall Warrant shall be
obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Metrocall Common
Stock of such converted Metrocall Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (y) the Metrocall Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
cent.   -6-   (ii) Unissued Shares Under the Metrocall Plan of
Reorganization. At the Effective Time, all rights, contingent or otherwise,
to receive shares of Metrocall Common Stock, which are not yet issued and
outstanding, pursuant to a distribution under the Metrocall Plan of
Reorganization (each, a "Metrocall Stock Right"), shall no longer be rights
with respect to Metrocall Common Stock and shall thereafter be rights to
receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of
shares of Metrocall Common Stock such Metrocall Stock Right would be entitled
to receive multiplied by the Metrocall Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock, subject to the same terms and
conditions of the Metrocall Plan of Reorganization as were otherwise
applicable to the Metrocall Stock Rights. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Metrocall Board shall take, or shall cause its committees to take, all action
necessary to effectuate the foregoing.   (c) Arch Common Stock. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Arch Merger and without any action on the
part of any holder of capital stock of Arch or any holder of capital stock of
Arch Acquiring Sub:   (i) Subject to Sections 2.1(c)(ii) and 2.10, each
share of "Class A" common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Arch ("Arch
Common Stock") shall be converted into the right to receive one share (the
"Arch Exchange Ratio" and, together with the Metrocall Exchange Ratio, the
"Exchange Ratios") of Parent Common Stock. The shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued pursuant to this Section 2.1(c)(i) are referred to collectively
as "Arch Merger Consideration" and, together with the Metrocall Merger
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration." All shares of Parent Common Stock
issued pursuant to this Section 2.1(c)(i) shall be duly authorized, validly
issued and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to
the ownership of such shares. All shares of Arch Common Stock converted into
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(c)(i) shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly representing
any such shares shall cease to have any rights, except the right to receive
Parent Common Stock to be issued, in consideration for such shares upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with this Article II, without
interest.   (ii) All shares of Arch Common Stock that are owned by Arch
as treasury stock and any shares of Arch Common Stock owned by Metrocall or
any Subsidiary of Metrocall immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than shares under any existing employee benefit plan which are held by either
Company as trustee, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist
and no share capital of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefore.   (iii) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Arch Acquiring Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Arch Corporation.   (iv) If any shares of Arch Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
Arch, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such
shares of Arch Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same
repurchase option,   -7-  risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the
certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly
be marked with appropriate legends, except that this Section 2.1(c)(iv) shall
not apply to any such shares that, pursuant to the terms of the applicable
agreement, certificate or other governing instrument, would otherwise be
vested or freed of such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition as a result of the Transactions. Arch shall take all action that
may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is
entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in
any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.   (d) Arch
Stock Options and Unissued Shares Under the Arch Plan of Reorganization. (i)
Arch Stock Options. At the Effective Time, all options to purchase shares of
Arch Common Stock (each, an "Arch Stock Option") which are then outstanding
and unexercised shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Arch
Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to acquire,
on the same terms and conditions as were otherwise applicable under the Arch
Stock Option, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number
of shares of Arch Common Stock subject to such Arch Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, at a price per share equal to the per share
exercise price specified in such Arch Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that in the case of any Arch Stock
Option to which Section 421 of the Code, applies by reason of its
qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price per share,
the number of shares subject to such Arch Stock Option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such Arch Stock Option shall be determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Unless
otherwise elected by Arch prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall assume
Arch\'s obligations with respect to each outstanding Arch Stock Option in
such manner that Parent (i) is a corporation "assuming a stock option in a
transaction to which Section 424(a) applies" within the meaning of Section
424 of the Code or (ii) to the extent that Section 424 of the Code does not
apply to such Arch Stock Option, would be such a corporation were Section 424
of the Code applicable to such Arch Stock Option; and, if not so otherwise
elected, after the Effective Time, all references to Arch in the Arch Stock
Plan and the applicable Arch Stock Option agreements shall be deemed to refer
to Parent, which shall have assumed the Arch Stock Plan as of the Effective
Time by virtue of this Agreement and without any further action on the part
of Parent or Arch. Each Arch Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the Arch Stock Plan and the applicable Arch Stock
Option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Metrocall and
Arch shall use, and shall cause Parent to use, all reasonable efforts to
ensure that Arch Stock Options intended to qualify as incentive stock options
under Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective Time continue to
so qualify after the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Arch
Board shall take, or shall cause its committees to take, all action necessary
to effectuate the foregoing.   (ii) Unissued Shares Under the Arch Plan of
Reorganization. At the Effective Time, all rights, contingent or otherwise,
to receive shares of Arch Common Stock, which are not yet issued and
outstanding, pursuant to a distribution under the Arch Plan of Reorganization
(each, an "Arch Stock Right"), including pursuant to the Arch Stock Plan,
shall no longer be rights with respect to Arch Common Stock and shall
thereafter be rights to receive the same number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, subject to the same terms and conditions of the Arch Plan of
Reorganization and, as applicable, the Arch Stock Plan as were otherwise  
-8-  applicable to the Arch Stock Rights. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Arch Board shall take, or shall cause its committees to take, all action
necessary to effectuate the foregoing.   (e) Parent Actions with Respect to
Stock Options, Stock Rights and Warrants. (i) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall reserve for issuance and shall make available for issuance in
accordance with Sections 2.1(b) and 2.1(d) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock necessary to satisfy Parent\'s obligations under Sections 2.1(b)
and 2.1(d). With respect to the Arch Stock Plan and Metrocall Option Plan to
be assumed by Parent, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary or
appropriate to, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to options granted under such plans to the extent required under
applicable law in order for such shares to be sold without restriction, and
Parent shall use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectuses
contained therein), as well as comply with any applicable state securities or
"blue sky" laws, for so long as such benefits and grants remain payable and
such options under such plans remain outstanding.   (ii) As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be delivered to
all holders of Metrocall Stock Options, to the extent the holder thereof
possesses such Metrocall Stock Options pursuant to the Metrocall Option Plan,
appropriate notices setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to the
Metrocall Option Plan (as defined in Section 4.2(a)) and agreements
evidencing the grants of such Metrocall Stock Options. To the
extent permitted by law, Parent shall comply with the terms of the Metrocall
Option Plan and shall take such reasonable steps as are necessary or required
by, and subject to the provisions of, the Metrocall Option Plan, to have the
Metrocall Stock Options which qualified as incentive stock options prior to
the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive stock options of Parent
after the Effective Time.   (iii) As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be delivered to all holders of Arch
Stock Rights, to the extent the holder thereof possesses such Arch Stock
Rights pursuant to the Arch Stock Plan, and Arch Stock Options, as the case
may be, appropriate notices setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to
the Arch Stock Plan and agreements evidencing the grants of such and Arch
Stock Rights and Arch Stock Options, as applicable. To the extent permitted
by law, Parent shall comply with the terms of the Arch Stock Plan and shall
take such reasonable steps as are necessary or required by, and subject to
the provisions of, the Arch Stock Plan, to have the Arch Stock Options which
qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to
qualify as incentive stock options of Parent after the Effective Time.  
(iv) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be delivered to all holders of Metrocall Warrants appropriate notices setting
forth such holders\' rights pursuant thereto.   (f) Cancellation of Parent
Stock. The shares of capital stock of Parent owned by Metrocall and Arch
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled at the Effective
Time.   -9-   Section 2.2 Exchange Fund. Concurrently with or prior to the
Effective Time, Metrocall and Arch shall jointly designate a duly qualified
bank or trust company to act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for purposes of
exchanging certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Arch Common Stock or shares of Metrocall Common Stock
("Certificates") for the applicable Merger Consideration. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for
the benefit of holders of Certificates, certificates representing the Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(c) upon conversion
of outstanding shares of Arch Common Stock and Metrocall Common Stock, cash
for payment of the Cash Election Price with respect to the Electing Shares
and cash for payment of any fractional shares referred to in Section 2.10.
Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant
to Section 2.9. Any cash and certificates representing Parent Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"Exchange Fund".   Section 2.3 Elections. (a) Each Person who, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, is (i) a record holder of shares of Metrocall
Common Stock shall be entitled, with respect to all or any portion of such
shares, to make an unconditional election to receive cash in exchange for
such shares or (ii) a holder of vested Metrocall Stock Options giving an
irrevocable notice of exercise of such Metrocall Stock Options prior to the
Effective Time, subject only to the Closing, shall be entitled to make an
election to receive cash in exchange for the shares of Metrocall Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such Metrocall Stock Options.   (b) Parent shall,
or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, prepare and mail a form of election
(the "Form of Election") with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as
defined in Section 3.16) to holders of Metrocall Common Stock of record
(other than shares of Metrocall Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(ii)) and holders of vested Metrocall Stock Options as of the
record date for the meeting of stockholders of Metrocall (the
"Metrocall Stockholders Meeting") to obtain the Metrocall Stockholders
Approval (as defined in Section 4.4(d)), which shall be used by each such
holder who wishes to elect to receive the Cash Election Price for any or all
shares of Metrocall Common Stock held by such holder as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Prior to the record date of the Metrocall Stockholders
Meeting, the Metrocall Board or a committee thereof shall establish
procedures for holders of vested Metrocall Stock Options to give an
irrevocable notice of exercise of such Metrocall Stock Options, to deposit
funds for the exercise thereof, to make the cash election and to provide for
netting of funds to be received pursuant to the cash election against funds
to be deposited for the exercise of such Metrocall Stock Options. In
addition, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the Form
of Election and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus available to all Persons
who become holders of Metrocall Common Stock or Metrocall Stock Options
during the period between such record date and the Election Date. Any such
election to receive the Cash Election Price will be properly made only if (i)
the Exchange Agent has received a Form of Election at its designated office,
by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on (A) the Business Day immediately
preceding the date of the Metrocall Stockholders Meeting or (B) any later
date as to which Metrocall may provide, in consultation with Arch (the
"Election Date") (which date Parent shall publicly announce as soon as
practicable but in no event less than five Business Days prior to the
Election Date), provided that the Companies shall agree to any Election Date,
and notice thereof, required to comply with any legal requirements with
respect thereto, and (ii) such Form of   -10-  Election is properly
completed and signed and, in the case of holders of Metrocall Common Stock,
accompanied by certificates for the shares of Metrocall Common Stock to which
such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form
acceptable for transfer on the books of Metrocall (or by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery of such certificates as set forth in such Form of
Election from a firm which is a member of a registered national
securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent
in the United States, provided such certificates are in fact delivered to the
Exchange Agent within three Business Days after the date of execution of such
guarantee of delivery). A record holder acting in different capacities or
acting on behalf of other Persons in any way will be entitled to submit an
Election Form for each capacity in which such record holder so acts with
respect to each Person for which it so acts.   (c) Any Form of Election may
be revoked by the holder of Metrocall Common Stock submitting such Form of
Election to the Exchange Agent only by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Election Date.
In addition, all Forms of Election shall automatically be revoked if the
Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Metrocall and Arch that the Merger
has been abandoned. If a Form of Election is so revoked, in the case of a
holder of Metrocall Common Stock submitting such Form of Election to the
Exchange Agent, the certificate or certificates (or guarantee of delivery, as
appropriate) for the shares of Metrocall Common Stock to which such Form of
Election relates shall be promptly returned to such holder.   (d) The
Exchange Agent may, with the agreement of Metrocall, in consultation with
Arch, make such rules as are consistent with this Section 2.3 for the
implementation of the elections provided for in this Section 2.3 and
in Section 2.4 as shall be necessary or desirable to fully effect such
elections with respect to Metrocall Common Stock and Metrocall Stock
Options.   (e) The Exchange Agent shall have discretion to determine whether
or not an election to receive the Cash Election Price has been properly made
or revoked pursuant to this Section 2.3 with respect to shares of Metrocall
Common Stock and when elections and revocations were received by it. If the
Exchange Agent determines that any election to receive the Cash Election
Price was not properly made with respect to shares of Metrocall Common Stock,
such shares shall be treated by the Exchange Agent as shares that were not
Electing Shares at the Effective Time, and subject to the provisions of
Sections 2.1(a)(v), 2.4 and 2.10, such shares shall be exchanged in the
Merger for shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i)(B). If
the Exchange Agent determines that any contingent election to receive the
Cash Election Price was not properly made with respect to Metrocall Stock
Options, such contingent election shall be deemed as not made and such
Metrocall Stock Options shall be exchanged in the Merger for options to
purchase Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(b). The Exchange Agent
shall also make all computations as to the allocation and the pro-ration,
including the determination of the deemed elections contemplated by Section
2.4 and any such computation and deemed elections shall be conclusive and
binding on the holders of Metrocall Common Stock and Metrocall
Stock Options.   Section 2.4 Allocation of Cash and Parent Common Stock.
(a) Election Number. Two million (2,000,000) (the "Election Number") shares
of Metrocall Common Stock,   -11-  including shares of Metrocall Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of Metrocall Stock Options as provided in
Section 2.3(a), shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Election Price at the Effective Time.   (b) Excess Electing Shares. If the
number of Electing Shares exceeds the Election Number, then shares of
Metrocall Common Stock other than the Electing Shares and Appraisal Shares
(collectively, the "Non-Electing Shares") shall be converted into shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(i)(B) and Electing
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Price
or shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Sections 2.1(a)(i)(A) and
2.1(a)(i)(B) in the following manner:   (i) A proration factor (the "Excess
Proration Factor") shall be determined by dividing the Election Number by the
total number of Electing Shares.   (ii) The number of Electing Shares
covered by an Election to be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Election Price shall be determined by multiplying the Excess Proration Factor
by the total number of Electing Shares covered by such Election.   (iii)
All Electing Shares other than those shares converted into the right to
receive the Cash Election Price in accordance with Section 2.4(b)(ii) shall
be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section
2.1(a)(i)(B), subject to Section 2.10.   (c) Deemed Elections. If the number
of Electing Shares is less than or equal to the Election Number, then all
Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Election Price in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(1)(A) and the Non-Electing
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive either the (i) Cash
Election Price and the holders thereof shall be deemed to have properly made
an election with respect to such shares or (ii) shares of Parent Common Stock
in accordance with Sections 2.1(a)(1)(A) and 2.1(a)(1)(B) in the following
manner:   (i) A proration factor (the "Deemed Election Proration
Factor") shall be determined by dividing (A) the Election Number minus the
total number of Electing Shares by (B) the total number of Non-Electing
Shares.   (ii) The number of Non-Electing Shares of each stockholder to
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Price and deemed to
have properly made an election with respect to such shares shall be
determined by multiplying the Deemed Election Proration Factor by the total
number of Non-Electing Shares held by such stockholder.   (iii) All Non-
Electing Shares other than those shares converted into the right to receive
the Cash Election Price in accordance with Sections 2.4(c)(ii) shall be
converted into shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section
2.1(a)(1)(B), subject to Section 2.10.   Section 2.5 Exchange Procedures. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail or make available to Cede and Co. and, as appropriate, each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates which immediately prior to
the   -12-  Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Arch Common
Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Arch Merger
Consideration and each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Metrocall Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Metrocall Merger Consideration, a notice and letter of
transmittal advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the
procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent such Certificate or
Certificates in exchange for cash or shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article II. The Exchange
Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with
respect to the shares of Metrocall Common Stock and Arch Common
Stock surrendered to it and held by it from time to time hereunder, except
that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or
distributed with respect to such Metrocall Common Stock and Arch Common Stock
for the account of the Persons entitled thereto.   Section 2.6 Right to
Receive Merger Consideration. (a) Each holder of shares of Arch Common Stock
or Metrocall Common Stock that have been converted into a right to receive
Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate
or Certificates, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal
covering such shares of Arch Common Stock or Metrocall Common Stock, will be
entitled to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as set forth in
Section 2.1(a) or Section 2.1(c), as applicable. Until so surrendered, each
share of Arch Common Stock or Metrocall Common Stock shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes, only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to Section 2.9. If any Merger Consideration is to be issued to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Arch Common Stock or Metrocall Common
Stock represented by the Certificate or Certificates surrendered with respect
thereto, it shall be a condition to such issuance that the Certificate or
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such issuance shall
pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of
such issuance to a Person other than the registered holder of such Arch
Common Stock or Metrocall Common Stock or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Article II, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any affiliate (as
defined in Section 6.5) of Arch or Metrocall shall not be exchanged until the
later of (a) the date Parent has received an Affiliate Agreement (as defined
in Section 6.5) from such affiliate, or (b) the date shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable to such affiliate are transferable pursuant to the Affiliate
Agreement regardless of whether such agreement was executed by the
affiliate.   Section 2.7 Stock Transfer Books. As of the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Arch Common
Stock or Metrocall Common Stock that were outstanding prior to the Effective
Time. After the Effective Time, Certificates presented to either Surviving
Arch Corporation or Surviving Metrocall Corporation for transfer shall be
canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth, in this Article II. At the close of business
on the Closing Date, the stock ledger of Arch with respect to the issuance of
Arch Common Stock and the stock ledger of Metrocall with respect to the
issuance of Metrocall Common Stock shall be closed.   -13-    Section
2.8 Release of Exchange Fund. From and after the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the holders of shares of Arch Common Stock and Metrocall Common Stock shall
be returned to Parent upon demand. Any such holder who has not delivered his
shares of Arch Common Stock or Metrocall Common Stock to the Exchange Agent
in accordance with this Article II prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of
shares of Arch Common Stock or Metrocall Common Stock,
respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Surviving
Arch Corporation nor Surviving Metrocall Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of shares of Arch Common Stock or Metrocall Common Stock for any
securities delivered or any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property laws.   Section 2.9 Distributions with Respect
to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends, interest or other distributions with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to Arch Common
Stock or Metrocall Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as
provided in this Article II. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid,
without interest, to the Person in whose name the shares of Parent Common
Stock are registered, all dividends and other distributions payable in
respect of such securities on a date subsequent to, and in respect of a
record date after, the Effective Time.   Section 2.10 No Fractional
Securities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing less than one share of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued in the Merger, and no Parent Common Stock dividend, stock
split or interest shall relate to any fractional security, and such
fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any
other rights of a security holder. In lieu of any such fractional
shares, each holder of shares of Metrocall Common Stock who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
upon surrender of Certificates for exchange pursuant to this Article II shall
be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent a cash payment equal to such
fraction multiplied by the Cash Election Price, without interest.   Section
2.11 Adjustments To Exchange Ratios and Cash Election Price.   (a) The
Exchange Ratios were reached upon the basis that, after giving effect to the
exchange of the Election Number of shares of Metrocall Common Stock,
including shares of Metrocall Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
Metrocall Warrants, Metrocall Stock Rights and Metrocall Stock Options, for
the Cash Election Price, the Metrocall Fully Diluted Shares would be
exchanged for 27.5% of the Parent Fully Diluted Shares and the Arch
Fully Diluted Shares would be exchanged for 72.5% of the Parent Fully Diluted
Shares. To the extent that (i) any inaccuracy of a representation or warranty
in Section 3.2 or 4.2 and/or (ii) an increase in the Arch Fully Diluted
Shares in accordance with Schedule 3.2 is determined to have resulted in a
failure of the Exchange Ratios to result in the percentage stockholding
described in the preceding sentence, then the Metrocall Exchange Ratio shall
be adjusted accordingly. To the extent any such change in the Metrocall
Exchange Ratio results from an inaccuracy of a representation or warranty in
Section 4.2, the Cash Election Price shall be adjusted in proportion to the
adjustment to the Metrocall Exchange Ratio. "Parent Fully Diluted Shares"
shall mean the outstanding equity of Parent to be exchanged for the
outstanding equity of Metrocall and Arch as    -14-  of the Effective
Time, comprised of all issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock,
whether restricted or unrestricted, shares of Parent Common Stock reserved
for issuance upon exercise of issued and outstanding options and warrants,
whether vested or unvested, and shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for
issuance in exchange for shares of Metrocall Common Stock and Arch
Common Stock contemplated to be issued under the Metrocall Plan of
Reorganization and the Arch Plan of Reorganization, respectively, but not
including the shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for issuance under the
equity incentive plan to be established by the Parent Board as contemplated
in Section 6.11(f).   (b) The Metrocall Exchange Ratio and the Cash Election
Price shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Metrocall Common Stock or Arch
Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Metrocall Common Stock or Arch Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.  
Section 2.12 Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Transactions shall
take place simultaneously at the offices of Schulte Roth and Zabel LLP, located
at 919 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022, as promptly as practicable
(but in any event within five Business Days) following the date on which the
last of the conditions set forth in Article VII is fulfilled (other than
conditions contemplated to be fulfilled on the Closing Date) or waived or at
such other time and place as Metrocall and Arch shall agree. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing
Date".   Section 2.13 Lost, Stolen, Destroyed Certificates. In the event
that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange

(as defined below). True, accurate and complete copies of Arch\'s certificate
of incorporation, as amended (the "Arch Certificate of Incorporation") and
bylaws, as amended (the "Arch Bylaws"), in each case as in effect the date
hereof, including all amendments thereto, have been delivered to Metrocall.

Subsidiaries in any material respect), (3) legal, accounting, investment
banking or other fees or expenses incurred solely in connection with the
Transactions, (4) the payment of any amounts due to, or the provision of any
other benefits to, any officers or employees under the terms of employment

Subsidiary of Arch are validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, and are owned directly or indirectly by Arch, free and
clear of any liens, claims or encumbrances. There are no subscriptions,

directors, employees, Subsidiaries, agents and advisors and other
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it), not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information),
or take any other action knowingly to facilitate, any inquiries or the making
of any proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to
its stockholders) that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to,

Section 5.2(a) shall prohibit the board of directors of a Company from
complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.   (c) Prior to obtaining the Arch Stockholders\' Approval or

5.2(d) shall prohibit the board of directors of such Company from considering
and negotiating (including furnishing nonpublic information) an unsolicited

best efforts to notify the other Company promptly, and in no event later than
one Business Day after receipt, if any proposal or offer, or any inquiry or

Transaction is made. Each Company immediately shall cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to a Competing Transaction; provided,
however, that such Company shall not release any third party from, or waive
any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is
a party. Each Company shall use its best efforts to ensure that its
officers, directors, employees, Subsidiaries, agents and advisors or other
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it) are aware of the restrictions described in this Section

and regulations of any applicable law in connection with the Transactions.

accordance with this Agreement all licenses, permits and authorizations

consult with and keep the other party promptly apprised of any communications

authorities with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (vi)
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain FCC approvals. The Companies
shall cooperate to resolve any objections to FCC and other governmental
approvals of the Transactions and shall not voluntarily take actions that
would give any governmental authorities grounds to institute proceedings
against either party.   (c) Each Company shall promptly (and in not more
than five Business Days from the date hereof) make its filings under the HSR
Act with respect to the Transactions and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly make any other required submission under the
HSR Act and resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by a
governmental agency with respect to the Transactions under the Antitrust
Laws. In connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
Transaction as violative of any Antitrust Law, each Company shall cooperate
and use all commercially reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist
any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent (each, an "Order") that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents, conditions or restricts consummation of the Merger
or the other Transactions, unless by mutual agreement the Companies decide
that such litigation or contest is not in their respective best interests.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, it is
expressly understood and agreed that neither Company shall have
any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding or any Order beyond the earlier of (i) the date that either
Company has a right of termination under Section 8.1(b) or (ii) the date on
which a ruling preliminarily enjoining the Merger issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction. Each Company shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the termination or
expiration of any waiting periods imposed under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws with respect to such Transactions as promptly as possible
after the execution of this Agreement.   -53-   (d) Neither Company shall
be required to agree, as a condition to any approval or waiver from any
governmental authority, to divest itself of or hold separate any Subsidiary,
division, business unit or material asset.   (e) Metrocall and Arch each
shall consult with and keep the other party apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the Transactions, including, without limitation,
promptly furnishing the other party with copies of notices or other
communications received by Metrocall or Arch, as the case may be, or any of
its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any governmental authority with
respect to the Merger and the Transactions.   (f) Each of Metrocall and Arch
shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices
to third Persons, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use,
their reasonable best efforts to obtain any third Persons consents (A)
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions, (B) otherwise
required under any contracts, licenses, leases or other agreements in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions or (C) required to
prevent a Metrocall Material Adverse Effect or Arch Material Adverse Effect
from occurring prior to the Effective Time or any like material adverse
effect with respect to Parent from occurring after the Effective Time. In the
event that any party shall fail to obtain any such third Person consent, such
party shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such actions
reasonably requested by the other parties, to limit the adverse effect upon
Metrocall, Arch and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and
their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected
to result after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such
consent.   (g) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Metrocall or Arch
to agree to the imposition of conditions, the payment of any material
amounts (other than filing fees and Expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with obtaining such consents or approvals) or any requirement of
divestiture to obtain any consents or approvals from third parties, including
governmental authorities, required to consummate the Transactions, and in no
event shall any party take, or be required to take, any action that would
have a Metrocall Material Adverse Effect or an Arch Material Adverse
Effect.   (h) Metrocall and Arch agree to cooperate with respect to, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to cooperate with respect
to, and agree to use their reasonable best efforts to contest and resist, any
action, including legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) of any governmental
authority that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
consummation of the Merger or any of the Transactions.   (i) In the event
any litigation is commenced by any Person relating to the Transactions,
either party shall have the right, at its own expense, to reasonably
participate therein, and each Company will not settle any such litigation
without the consent of the other, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.   (j) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the proper officers and   -54-  directors of Metrocall, Arch, Parent,
Surviving Metrocall Corporation and Surviving Arch Corporation shall take all
such necessary action.   (k) To the extent reasonably practicable, neither
Company shall agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with any
governmental entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Transactions unless it consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such governmental
entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meeting or discussion.   (l) Arch and Metrocall shall cooperate and
coordinate with each other and use their collective reasonable best efforts
to obtain financing required to pay the Cash Election Price at the Closing
(the "Financing") as soon as practicable after the date hereof on terms
reasonably satisfactory to Metrocall and Arch. Each of Metrocall and Arch
shall use its reasonable best efforts to make their respective executive
officers and other members of management and employees available upon
reasonable advance notice to participate in discussions with financing
sources, including roadshows and lender meetings. Each of Metrocall and Arch
shall provide, or cause to be provided, access to information to potential
financing sources and their representatives on the terms and conditions set
forth in Section 6.2.   (m) Metrocall and Arch expect that their respective
executive officers and other members of senior management will continue to
perform their respective duties and obligations and intend that any such
officers\' failure or refusal to cooperate and to take all actions and to do
all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the Transactions, including participating in any proxy solicitation
activities with respect to the Transactions and securing the Financing, or
otherwise fully cooperate shall constitute grounds for dismissal of such
officer with cause.   Section 6.2 Access To Information. Subject to
applicable law, including laws restricting access to competitively sensitive
information, Arch shall afford to Metrocall and its respective accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives (the "Metrocall
Representatives") and Metrocall and its Subsidiaries shall afford to Arch and
its accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives (the
"Arch Representatives") reasonable access during normal business hours
throughout the Interim Period (with reasonable advance notice) to all of
their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments and records
(including tax returns) and, during such period, shall furnish promptly to
one another (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or
received by any of them pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws or filed by any of them with the SEC in connection with the
Transactions and (ii) such other information concerning their respective
businesses, properties and personnel as either Company shall reasonably
request; provided, however, that such access shall not unreasonably disrupt
the furnishing party\'s operations and shall not be deemed to permit the
other party to conduct any onsite environmental investigations
or examinations, other than a Phase I site assessment; provided, further,
that no fact or information uncovered as a result of such access shall amend
or modify any representations or warranties made herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the respective parties to consummate the Merger. Arch
shall hold and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Arch
Representatives to hold, and Metrocall and its Subsidiaries shall hold and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause Metrocall Representatives to
hold, in strict confidence as   -55-  "Evaluation Material" under the

Metrocall may disclose such information as may be necessary in connection
with seeking the Arch Required Statutory Approvals, Arch Stockholders\'
Approval, Metrocall Required Statutory Approvals and Metrocall Stockholders\'
Approval, and (ii) each of Arch and Metrocall may disclose any information
that it is required by law or judicial or administrative order to disclose,
provided, however, that in either case the disclosing party will use
reasonable best efforts to assure confidential treatment is accorded such
information.   Section 6.3 Registration Statement and Proxy Statement.(a)

Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Metrocall, Arch and Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC the Registration Statement (in which the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be included as a Prospectus) as promptly
as practicable. Metrocall and Arch each shall use, and shall cause Parent to
use, its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
(including by responding promptly to any comments made by the SEC with
respect thereto), and promptly thereafter mail the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to the stockholders of Metrocall and Arch. Metrocall and
Arch each shall also use, and shall cause Parent to use, its reasonable best
efforts to obtain prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement
all necessary state securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals
required in connection with the Merger and the Transactions and will pay all
expenses incident thereto. Each party shall notify the other of the receipt
of the comments of the SEC and of any requests by the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement or for additional information and shall promptly supply one another
with copies of all correspondence between any of them (or their
representatives) and the SEC (or its staff) with respect thereto. Each of the

comment on any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus prior to filing such with the SEC. If,

Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the parties shall
promptly inform one another and shall cooperate in promptly preparing, filing
and clearing with the SEC and, if required by applicable securities laws,
mailing to the stockholders of Metrocall or Arch, as the case may be, such
amendment or supplement. Arch and Metrocall shall cause Parent to take any
action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process)
required to be taken under any applicable federal or state securities laws in
connection with the issuance of the Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
Transactions.   (b) Metrocall and Arch each shall, and shall cause Parent
to, upon request by the other party, furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the
Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made by, or on behalf of, Metrocall, Arch,   -56-  Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any governmental authority
in connection with the Merger and the Transactions.   (c) Prior to the date
of approval of the Merger by their respective stockholders, each of Arch and
Metrocall shall, and shall cause Parent to, correct promptly any information
provided by it to be used specifically in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Registration Statement that shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect and shall take all steps necessary to
file with the SEC and have declared effective or cleared by the SEC any
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Registration Statement so as to correct the same and to cause the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus as so corrected to be disseminated to the
stockholders of Arch and Metrocall, in each case to the extent required by
applicable law.   (d) Metrocall and Arch each shall, with respect to audited
financial statements, pro-forma financial statements or other financial

auditor or expert addressed to the requesting party to use such auditor\'s or
expert\'s name and include such statements or reports in any Arch SEC Report
or Metrocall SEC Report, as applicable, to be filed by the requesting
party.   (e) Each of the Companies will advise the other promptly after
it receives notice or otherwise becomes aware thereof, of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop
order, or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction.   (f) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by
reference) to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement shall be made without the approval of both Companies, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that with
respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in
the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right of
approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other
party or its business, financial condition or results of operations;
provided, further, that Arch or Metrocall may amend or supplement the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Registration Statement (including by
incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment (as defined

Section 5.2, and in such event, the right of approval shall apply only with
respect to information relating to the other party or its business, financial
condition or results of operations, and shall be subject to the right of each
party to have its Board of Directors\' deliberations and conclusions
accurately described. A "Qualifying Amendment" means an amendment

which, in the opinion of legal counsel satisfactory to Parent, is exempt from

commercially reasonable efforts to take such customary and
reasonable actions, from time to time after the Effective Time, as are

commercially reasonable efforts to remedy, (i) the occurrence or failure to
occur of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would be likely to

or inaccurate in any material respect on the Closing Date in any case which
would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of one or more of the
other Company\'s conditions to closing set forth in Article VII, (ii) any
failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it thereunder in any case which
would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of one or more of the
other Company\'s conditions to closing set forth in Article VII and (iii) any
event, development, change, or effect that has or would reasonably be
expected to materially impair the operations of the business of such Company;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
6.8 shall not limit or otherwise affect the rights or remedies available

respective Subsidiaries. From and after the Effective Time, Parent, Surviving
Metrocall Corporation and Surviving Arch Corporation shall, and shall cause

former directors and officers of such Company and its Subsidiaries) fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations, including with respect to
advancing expenses, of Parent, Surviving Metrocall Corporation and Surviving
Arch Corporation, and their respective Subsidiaries, pursuant to
any indemnification agreements between Arch or Metrocall, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, and their respective current and former directors
and officers in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and any
indemnification provisions under the Arch Certificate of Incorporation and
Arch Bylaws or Metrocall Certificate of Incorporation and Metrocall Bylaws,
or the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and comparable organizational

reasonably adequate provisions shall be made so that its successors and
assigns shall assume the obligations of Parent, Surviving Metrocall
Corporation, Surviving Arch Corporation, or any such Subsidiaries, as
applicable, as set forth in this Section 6.9 to the extent such assumption
does not occur by operation of law.   (c) For a period of six years after

current and former director and officer of Arch and Metrocall as of the
Effective Time, liability insurance coverage with respect to matters arising

and conditions that are not materially less advantageous to such parties than
the coverage applicable to such individuals immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be
deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained on or
prior to the Effective Time to the extent such policies provide such current
and former directors with coverage for the period and on the terms and
conditions described in the preceding sentence.   (d) The rights of each
indemnified party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation
of, any other rights such indemnified party may have under the Arch

Options, Metrocall Stock Options or Metrocall Warrants or (ii) in respect of
Arch Stock Rights or Metrocall Stock Rights.   Section 6.11 Employee
Matters.(a) To the extent permitted by Parent\'s employee benefit plans and
applicable law, Parent will use reasonable efforts to give each employee of
Arch and Metrocall who is retained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries after
the Effective Time (a "Retained Employee") full credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting and determination of the level of benefits under any
employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent or any subsidiary
of Parent for such Retained Employees\' service with Arch or Metrocall, as
applicable to the same extent recognized by Arch or Metrocall, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time. In no event shall Retained Employees
be entitled to any credit to the extent that it would result in a duplication
of benefits with respect to the same period of service.   (b) To the extent
permitted by Parent\'s employee benefit plans and applicable law, Parent will
(i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Retained Employees under any welfare benefit plans that

Time under any welfare plan maintained for the Retained Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each Retained Employee with
credit for any portion of co-payments and deductibles paid prior to

or benefit inuring, after the Effective Time in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans

Time, Parent shall assume and honor in accordance with their terms all
employment, severance and other compensation agreements and arrangements
existing and disclosed by Arch or Metrocall, as applicable, prior to the

Stock issued under the Arch Stock Plan, which may be triggered by
the Merger.   (e) As of or promptly following the Effective Time,
Parent will establish a key employee retention program for the benefit of key
employees identified as such by Parent\'s Board (or the compensation

Stock Option Agreement or under the respective employment agreements of
Messrs. Baker, Daniels and Pottle, in each case as such term is defined
therein, or otherwise provide a reasonable basis for any participant therein
or    -62-  party thereto, as applicable, to believe that a "Change in
Control" has occurred or will occur as a consequence of the consummation of
the Transactions.   Section 6.12 Tax-Free Transaction.(a) The Merger is
intended to constitute an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code. From
and after the date of this Agreement, each party hereto shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and shall not, without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto, knowingly take any actions
or cause any actions to be taken which could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as an exchange described in Section 351 of
the Code. If the Merger shall fail to qualify as an exchange described in
Section 351 of the Code, then the parties hereto agree to negotiate in good
faith to restructure the Merger in order that it shall otherwise qualify as a
transaction that is in whole or in part tax-free under the Code. Following
the Effective Time, and consistent with any such consent, neither of the
Surviving Corporations nor Parent nor any of their respective affiliates
knowingly and voluntarily shall take any action or cause any action to be
taken which could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code or otherwise as a
transaction that is in whole or in part tax-free under the Code.   (b)
Following the Effective Time, Parent shall conduct its business and shall
cause each of the Surviving Corporations to conduct its business, in a manner
which would not jeopardize the characterization of the Merger as an exchange
described in Section 351 of the Code or otherwise as a transaction that is
whole or in part tax-free under the Code. Parent will provide certain factual
representations as reasonably requested by Arch or Metrocall as necessary to
confirm that Parent will not take any action on or after the Effective Time
that would jeopardize the tax free nature of the Merger as an exchange
described in Section 351 of the Code or otherwise as a transaction that is in
whole or in part tax-free under the Code.   Section 6.13 Exemption From
Liability Under Section 16(b).(a) Provided that Arch and Metrocall delivers
to Parent the Section 16 Information (as defined below) with respect to Arch
and Metrocall, respectively, prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of Parent (the "Parent Board"), or a committee of Non-Employee

Stock, as applicable, and of options on Parent Common Stock upon assumption
and conversion by Parent of Arch Stock Options or Metrocall Stock Options, as
applicable, in each case pursuant to the Transactions and to the extent that
such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be
exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.   (b)
"Section 16 Information" means information accurate in all respects regarding
the Insiders, the number of shares of Arch Common Stock or Metrocall Common
Stock, as applicable, or other equity securities thereof deemed to be
beneficially owned by each Insider and expected to be exchanged for

result of death or incapacitation, the individual nominated by the Arch Board
to serve on the Parent Board as the alternate ninth director as set forth in
Section 6 of Schedule A), and Section 1 of Schedule A shall be amended
accordingly. The parties intend that the selection of the ninth member of the
Parent Board shall be deemed to have been made by the Arch Board and shall
not constitute or give rise, upon consummation of the Transactions, to a
"Change in Control" under Arch\'s Management Long-Term Incentive Plan, the
Arch Stock Plan or any related Restricted Stock Agreement or under the
respective employment agreements of Messrs. Baker, Daniels and Pottle.
Immediately after the Effective Time, the Chairman of the Parent Board shall

Bylaws. The Chairman of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee
and Nominating and Governance Committee of the Parent Board shall be selected
and approved to so serve by a majority of persons selected to serve on the

hereof is unable or unwilling to serve on the Parent Board or any committee
thereof as of the Effective Time, then, prior to the Effective Time, the

unreasonably withheld, and the relevant sections of Schedule A shall be
amended accordingly.   (d) In the event that any individual listed in
Sections 1, 2, 3 or 4 Schedule A who is a member of the Arch Board on the
date hereof is unable or unwilling to serve on the Parent Board or any
committee thereof as of the Effective Time, then, prior to the Effective
Time, the Arch Board shall designate a candidate to replace such individual,
which candidate shall be approved by the Metrocall Board, such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, and the relevant section(s) of Schedule A shall
be amended accordingly.    -64-   (e) Each of Metrocall and Arch shall
take such action, and shall cause Parent to take such action, as shall
reasonably be deemed by either thereof to be advisable to give effect to the
provisions set forth in this Section 6.14.   (f) Each of the foregoing
