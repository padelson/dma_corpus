the Applicable Cost Overruns Escrow Agreement, and shall be distributed at
the end of each Applicable Year as follows (until such time as no further
funds remain in escrow pursuant to the Applicable Cost Overruns Escrow
Agreement):

	      (i)   In the case of each Applicable Year, in the event
    that the Applicable Cost Overruns for such Applicable Year were greater
    than zero dollars ($0), an amount equal to the Applicable Cost Overruns
    for such Applicable Year shall be distributed to the Acquirer (up to
    the entire remaining Applicable Cost Overruns Escrow Account Deposit,
    including the earnings resulting from the investment thereof) promptly
    following the determination of the amount of such distribution pursuant
    to Section 1.3(c) hereof; provided, however, that the amount of the
    distribution to the Acquirer from the Applicable Cost Overruns Escrow
    Account Deposit in respect of any Applicable Year shall in no event
    (together with any payments required to be made by the R&A Shareholders
    to the Acquirer pursuant to Section 1.3(b) hereof) exceed the aggregate
    "Special Bonus Payments" required to be made by R&A during such
    Applicable Year pursuant to Section 3.1(d) of those Employment
    Agreements containing provisions relating to "Special Bonus Payments";

	      (ii)  In the case of each Applicable Year, following the
    making of any distribution required to be made to the Acquirer pursuant
    to Section 1.3(a)(i) in respect of such Applicable Year, an amount
    equal to the excess (if any) of (A) the remaining Applicable Cost
    Overruns Escrow Account Deposit (including the earnings resulting

    Applicable Year thereafter), shall be distributed to the R&A
    Shareholders promptly following the determination of the amount of such
    distribution pursuant to Section 1.3(c) hereof (with such distribution
    to be made in the same respective percentages that the Closing Purchase
    Price was paid to them; and

    <Page> 4

	      (iii)   In the case of the sixth (6th) Applicable Year
    following the Closing, any remaining portion of the Applicable Cost
    Overruns Escrow Account Deposit (including the earnings resulting from
    the investment thereof) which remains in escrow as of the end of such
    sixth (6th) Applicable Year (following the making of any distribution
    required to be made to the Acquirer pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) in
    respect of such Applicable Year) promptly shall be distributed to the
    R&A Shareholders (with such distribution to be made in the same respective
    percentages that the Closing Purchase Price was paid to them).

	      Each distribution required to be made to the R&A Shareholders
    from the Applicable Cost Overruns Escrow Account Deposit pursuant to this
    Section 1.3(a) shall be so distributed by wire transfer of immediately
    available funds to bank accounts designated in writing by the CMR
    Representative to the escrow agent under the Applicable Cost Overruns
    Escrow Agreement at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of
    any such distribution (or, in the absence of such a written designation
    by the CMR Representative, to the same bank accounts used for the payment
    of the cash portion of the Closing Purchase Price).

	      (b)   To the extent that the Applicable Cost Overruns
for any Applicable Year exceed the remaining Applicable Cost Overruns
Escrow Account Deposit (including the earnings resulting from the
investment thereof) available to be distributed to the Acquirer pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) hereof, the R&A Shareholders shall pay the amount of such
shortfall to the Acquirer (promptly following the determination of the
amount of any such payment pursuant to Section 1.3(c) hereof) by transfer
of immediately available funds to a bank account designated in writing by
the Acquirer to the CMR Representative at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the date of such payment (with any such payment to be made by the
individual R&A Shareholders in the same respective percentages that the
Closing Purchase Price was paid to them); provided, however, that the
amount of the aggregate payment required to be made by the R&A Shareholders
to the Acquirer pursuant to this Section 1.3(b) in respect of any
Applicable Year shall in no event (together with any distribution
required to be made to the Acquirer from the Applicable Cost Overruns
Escrow Account Deposit pursuant to Section 1.3(a) hereof) exceed the
aggregate "Special Bonus Payments" required to be made by R&A during
such Applicable Year pursuant to Section 3.1(d) of those Employment
Agreements containing provisions relating to "Special Bonus Payments".

	      (c)   As promptly as practicable following the end of
each Applicable Year (and in any event not later than ten (10) Business
Days following the finalization of the relevant dollar amounts under the
Revenue Sharing Agreement relating to such calculations), the Acquirer
shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the CMR Representative a
written statement setting forth the amounts of any Applicable Cost
Overruns for such Applicable Year and the distributions and any
additional payments required to be made pursuant to Sections 1.3(a),
1.3(b) and 1.3(d) hereof (including a calculation of the components
thereof in reasonable detail) (each, an "Applicable Cost Overruns
Statement").

	      The CMR Representative (and its agents and advisors)
shall have the right to review (and copy) the work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents and information prepared or reviewed by
or for the Acquirer in connection with the preparation of the Applicable
Cost Overruns Statement and to communicate with those persons who
conducted such preparation and review, and the Acquirer shall (and
shall cause its Affiliates, accountants and other outside service

<Page> 5

providers to) cooperate in good faith with the CMR Representative and its
agents and advisors, and provide them with reasonable access to the books
and records of the Acquirer and such other information as they may
reasonably request, in each case in connection with their review of
each Applicable Cost Overruns Statement.

	      Within ten (10) Business Days after the CMR Representative's
receipt of an Applicable Cost Overruns Statement, the CMR Representative
shall notify the Acquirer in writing of any objection to such Applicable
Cost Overruns Statement, specifying in reasonable detail any such
objections (and if the CMR Representative fails to notify the Acquirer of
any objections within such period, the CMR Representative shall be deemed
to have agreed to the Applicable Cost Overruns Statement as prepared by
the Acquirer).  If the CMR Representative does not so object, or if the
CMR Representative and the Acquirer agree on the resolution of all
such objections, the written statement shall be final and binding on all
parties hereto.  The Acquirer and the CMR Representative shall negotiate
in good faith to attempt to resolve any such objections, provided that
each of the Acquirer and the CMR Representative shall have the right at
any time after at least two (2) Business Days of negotiation to
unilaterally terminate in writing such negotiations.  Not later than
five (5) Business Days after either the Acquirer or the CMR Representative
shall have terminated such negotiations, all such disputed items shall be
submitted for resolution to the Accounting Firm, and each of the Acquirer
and the CMR Representative shall include in such submission their
calculations, work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents and
information used in connection with the preparation and review of the
Applicable Cost Overruns Statement, and shall cooperate with the Accounting
Firm in good faith to resolve such disputed items (including by providing
the Accounting Firm with the access described in the immediately preceding
paragraph).  The Acquirer and the CMR Representative shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause a written report of the Accounting
Firm resolving the disputed items to be rendered within ten (10) Business
Days of its appointment.  The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Acquirer and fifty percent (50%)
by the R&A Shareholders (such fees and expenses to be borne ratably by
the R&A Shareholders in proportion to their respective shares of the
consideration received at the Closing hereunder, and promptly reimbursed
to the CMR Representative upon its request), and the written report of
the Accounting Firm resolving such disputed items shall be final and
binding on all parties hereto.

	      (d)   To the extent that the investment of the Applicable
Cost Overruns Escrow Account Deposit during any Applicable Year has
resulted in net investment losses with respect to such Applicable Cost
Overruns Escrow Account Deposit (taken at fair market value), prior to
the making of any distributions from the Applicable Cost Overruns Escrow
Account Deposit pursuant to Section 1.3(a) with respect to such Applicable
Year, the R&A Shareholders shall deposit additional funds into the
Applicable Cost Overruns Escrow Account Deposit (with any such deposit to
be made by the individual R&A Shareholders in the same respective
percentages that the Closing Purchase Price was paid to them) in an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of the net investment
losses resulting during such Applicable Year from the investment
of the Applicable Cost Overruns Escrow Account Deposit or (ii) the amount
necessary to cause the Applicable Cost Overrun Escrow Account Deposit to
equal (A) ten million dollars ($10,000,000) (in the case of each of the
first two Applicable Years following the Closing) or (B) five million
dollars ($5,000,000) (in the case of each Applicable Year thereafter).

	       (e)   Promptly following the receipt by the Acquirer of
any distribution or other payment (whether received from the Applicable
Cost Overruns Escrow Account Deposit or directly from the R&A Shareholders)
pursuant to the preceding provisions of this Section 1.3, the
Acquirer shall make a cash contribution to the capital of R&A in an amount
equal to the amount of such distribution or other payment received by the
Acquirer pursuant to the preceding provisions of this Section 1.3, and
the gross amount of such capital contribution shall be utilized
by R&A in the manner contemplated by the second sentence of Section
1(c)(i) of the Revenue Sharing Agreement to pay the expenses and
expenditures of R&A and its subsidiaries giving rise to the Applicable
Cost Overruns that resulted in such distribution or other payment
being made to the Acquirer under this Section 1.3.

		1.4   Time and Place of Closing.  The closing of the
Stock Purchase (the "Closing") shall be held at the offices of Simpson

Business Days prior to October 1, 2001, or at such other place or time
as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by the Acquirer and R&A.

		 1.5   Further Assurances.  The R&A Shareholders shall,
from time to time after the Closing, at the request of the Acquirer,
execute and deliver such further customary instruments of transfer and
assignment as the Acquirer may reasonably request to fully
implement the Stock Purchase and the Asset Purchase.

		 1.6   Transfer Taxes.  Any transfer taxes, fees and
duties under applicable law incurred in connection with the Stock Purchase
or the Asset Purchase will be borne and paid fifty percent (50%) by the
R&A Shareholders (in the aggregate, with such amount to be borne pro rata
among the R&A Shareholders in accordance with their respective receipt of
the Closing Purchase Price) and fifty percent (50%) by the Acquirer, and
the R&A Shareholders and the Acquirer shall promptly reimburse each other

the third anniversary of the Closing Date multiplied by (II) 2.5, minus
(B) the Closing Purchase Price;

		(ii)   A further payment (but in no event less than zero

greater than double the larger of the Year 3 Contingent Payment or the

	      twelve (12) months ending on (and including) the sixth
	      anniversary of the Closing Date (the amount of any such
	      excess, the "Year 6 Revenue Shortfall"), then (x) the
	      Acquirer shall receive that portion of the Contingent Payment
	      Escrow Account Deposit (and a pro rata portion of the
	      earnings resulting from the investment thereof) that is
	      equal to the product of the Year 6 Revenue Shortfall

	      that the balance of such Contingent Payment was paid to them).

	      (d)   Each Contingent Payment shall be paid by the Acquirer
to the R&A Shareholders (and each distribution of a Contingent Payment
Escrow Account Deposit to be distributed to the R&A Shareholders shall be

1.8 below to the extent Acquirer Shares are delivered in partial payment of
a Contingent Payment) to bank accounts designated in writing by the CMR
Representative to the Acquirer at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the date of any such payment (or, in the absence of such a written
designation by the CMR Representative, to the same bank accounts used for
the payment of the cash portion of the Closing Purchase Price).  Any

anniversary of the Closing Date to the date such Contingent Payment is paid.

<Page> 12

	       (e)   At all times during the Earnout Period, the Acquirer
shall (and shall cause its Affiliates, including R&A and its subsidiaries,
to) have in place all necessary accounting and other systems and records
to enable the parties to accurately determine the amount of each
Contingent Payment required to be made under this Section 1.7.  The
Acquirer and each of the R&A Shareholders agrees to enter into a Contingent
Payment Escrow Agreement reasonably in advance of the first Contingent
Payment Escrow Account Deposit required to be made pursuant to Section
1.7(c) hereof.

	       1.8   Stock Consideration.

	       (a)   If the Acquirer so elects by delivery of an
irrevocable written notice (an "Acquirer Stock Notice") to R&A not less
than fifteen (15) "trading days" (as such term is used in the definition
of Acquirer Stock Price set forth below) prior to (A) the Closing, in the
case of the payment of the Closing Purchase Price, or (B) the date a
Contingent Payment is required to be made by the Acquirer pursuant to
Section 1.7 of this Agreement, in the case of the payment of such Contingent
Payment (such payment date described in the immediately preceding clause (A)
or (B) (as applicable), the "Applicable Payment Date"), the Acquirer shall
be permitted to pay up to fifty percent (50%) of the Closing Purchase
Price or such Contingent Payment (as applicable) (with the Acquirer Stock

(as applicable), the "Stock Component")) in the form of duly and validly
authorized, duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares
of Acquirer Common Stock ("Acquirer Shares") delivered to the R&A
Shareholders on the Applicable Payment Date (with such Acquirer Shares
to be delivered to the R&A Shareholders in such respective
proportions as are notified by R&A to the Acquirer in writing not less
than two (2) "trading days" (as such term is used in the definition of
Acquirer Stock Price set forth below) prior to the making of such payment),
and that portion of the Closing Purchase Price or such Contingent
Payment (as applicable) otherwise payable to each R&A Shareholder in the
form of immediately available funds pursuant to Section 1.2(b) hereof or
Section 1.7 hereof (as applicable) shall be reduced by the amount of the
Closing Purchase Price or such Contingent Payment (as applicable)
paid to such R&A Shareholder in the form of Acquirer Shares pursuant to
this Section 1.8; provided, however, that if (i) the Acquirer Registration
Statement (as defined below) relating to an Applicable Payment Date (X) is
not effective on or before the second (2nd) trading day immediately
preceding the Applicable Payment Date or (Y) having become so effective on
or before the second (2nd) trading day immediately preceding the Applicable

in the case of a delivery of Acquirer Shares in connection with the making
of a Contingent Payment, (X) since March 31, 2001 the Acquirer has undergone
a "change of control" (which shall mean, solely for purposes of this Section
1.8, that fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting capital stock of the
Acquirer is then owned by a single Person or "group" (as used in Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder), or that the
Acquirer and/or its subsidiaries have transferred fifty percent (50%) or
more of their consolidated assets to another Person or group (in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions), in each case
regardless of how structured) and/or (Y) since the end of the most recently

<Page> 13

completed fiscal year of the Acquirer which ended not less than one month
prior to the Applicable Payment Date, there has been any circumstance,
event or occurrence that has had or, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Acquirer (and the Acquirer shall represent and warrant in writing to the
R&A Shareholders as a condition to the delivery of Acquirer Shares in
connection with the making of a Contingent Payment that neither of the
events described in this clause (iii) has so occurred), then in any such
event (or combination of events) the Acquirer shall be required on the
Applicable Payment Date to pay the entire Closing Purchase Price or
Contingent Payment (as applicable) in the form of immediately available
funds pursuant to Section 1.2(b) hereof or Section 1.7 hereof
(as applicable) (in lieu of the delivery of any Acquirer Shares pursuant
to this Section 1.8); and provided, further, that, notwithstanding clause
(i)(X) of the immediately preceding proviso, solely in the event that an
Acquirer Registration Statement relating to the Stock Component (if any)
of the Closing Purchase Price is not effective on or before the second
(2nd) trading day immediately preceding the Closing, then in such event
(and provided that none of the other events described in clauses
(i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding proviso have occurred, and that
the Acquirer has complied with its covenants under Section 1.8(b) below),
the Acquirer shall be permitted to pay twenty-five percent (25%) of the
Closing Purchase Price (or such lower percentage as was specified in the
Acquirer Stock Notice) in the form of Acquirer Shares delivered to the R&A
Shareholders at the Closing (with such Acquirer Shares to be delivered to
the R&A Shareholders in such respective proportions as are notified by
R&A to the Acquirer in writing not less than two (2) trading days prior
to the making of such payment), provided that the Acquirer thereafter
shall be obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to have such Acquirer
Registration Statement become effective as promptly as possible
(and to otherwise comply with the Registration Rights Agreement.

	       (b)   Not later than forty-five (45) days prior to the
Closing Date, the Acquirer and the R&A Shareholders shall enter into a
Registration Rights Agreement.  Not later than forty-five (45) days prior
to each of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) each other Applicable Payment
Date thereafter (other than an Applicable Payment Date with respect to
which the Acquirer in its sole discretion has irrevocably elected, by
written notice delivered to the CMR Representative not later than
forty-five (45) days prior to such Applicable Payment Date, not to deliver
any Stock Component with respect to such Applicable Payment Date), the
Acquirer shall file a shelf registration statement with the SEC (each,
an "Acquirer Registration Statement") to permit the unrestricted resale
by the R&A Shareholders (and up to a total of five (5) of their transferees
in any transfer other than a public offering, provided that no independent
diligence access or comfort letters shall be required to be provided by
the Acquiror to any such transferee) as of such Applicable Payment Date
(and thereafter for the period provided for in the Registration Rights
Agreement) of those Acquirer Shares to be delivered to them in partial
payment of the Closing Purchase Price or the applicable Contingent Payment
hereunder (as applicable), and the Acquirer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have such registration statement declared effective by the
SEC as promptly as practicable (and in any event not later than the second
(2nd) trading day immediately preceding the Applicable Payment Date) and
to remain effective through the Applicable Payment Date (and thereafter
for two years, subject to those exceptions provided for in the Registration
Rights Agreement).

<Page> 14

	       (c)   In the event that a portion of the Closing Purchase
Price or any Contingent Payment is to be paid in the form of Acquirer
Shares pursuant to Section 1.8(a) hereof, the aggregate number of Acquirer
Shares required to be delivered by the Acquirer to the R&A Shareholders
shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the next highest whole number
of Acquirer Shares) obtained by dividing (i) the Stock Component by (ii)
the Average Acquirer Stock Price, where:

	       (A)   The "Average Acquirer Stock Price" is defined to mean
	the average (arithmetic mean) Acquirer Stock Price during the ten
	consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the second (2nd)
	trading day immediately preceding the Applicable Payment Date; and


	       (B)   The "Acquirer Stock Price" is defined to mean, for
	any trading day, the closing price for one share of Acquirer Common
	Stock, which shall be the last sale price or, in the case no such
	sale takes place on such trading day, the average of the closing bid
	and asked prices, in either case as reported in the principal
	consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities
	listed on The New York Stock Exchange.

In the event that there is a stock split (or reverse stock split), stock
dividend or other similar event during the relevant measuring period under
the foregoing calculations (or thereafter and prior to the delivery of
Acquirer Shares to the R&A Shareholders pursuant hereto), equitable and
appropriate adjustments shall be made in the application of the foregoing
calculations of the Average Acquirer Stock Price to take account of such
event.


SECTION 2.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF R&A

	       2.1   Making of Representations and Warranties.  On or
prior to the date of this Agreement, R&A has delivered to the Acquirer
schedules (the "Schedules") setting forth, among other things, items the
disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more representations, warranties or covenants of R&A
contained in this Agreement; references in this Agreement to a particular
Schedule are to the applicable section of the Schedules, provided that
disclosure of a fact, event or circumstance in or pursuant to any section
of the Schedules shall constitute disclosure of such fact, event or
circumstance for purposes of each other representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement with respect to which the
applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure. The inclusion of an item in the Schedules as an exception
to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by R&A
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is, individually or in the aggregate with
any other included items, reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect on the Royce Companies.  For the avoidance of doubt,
references in this Section 2 to changes occurring after the date of this
Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other sections
of this Agreement which may prohibit such changes or require the
Acquirer's consent thereto.

	      Subject to the foregoing, R&A hereby makes to
the Acquirer the representations and warranties contained in this Section

Acquirer, either Royce Company, any R&A Shareholder or any of their
respective Affiliates.

		To the extent the Fund Board Approval is obtained for a
Registered Fund Client, R&A shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain the
approval of shareholders of such Registered Fund Client ("Fund Shareholder
Approval") of such new advisory agreement and disinterested directors or
trustees (as applicable), including by causing (or, in the case of any
Registered Fund Client that is not a Proprietary Fund Client, requesting
the sponsor of such Registered Fund Client to cause) the preparation and
mailing to such shareholders of a proxy statement describing the
transactions contemplated hereby and the new advisory agreement and
disinterested directors or trustees (as applicable), and by holding
(or, in the case of any Registered Fund Client that is not a Proprietary
Fund Client, requesting the sponsor of such Registered Fund Client to hold)
the shareholder meeting as promptly as practicable (provided that the
requirements of this sentence shall not be applicable with respect to any
Registered Fund Client that is not a Proprietary Fund Client and which has
obtained exemptive relief from the SEC permitting its new advisory
agreement to be entered into with R&A without shareholder approval).
Each such proxy statement relating to a Proprietary Fund Client shall be
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Acquirer (provided
that each such proxy statement shall be conclusively deemed reasonably
satisfactory to the Acquirer if the Acquirer does not communicate to R&A an
objection thereto within five (5) Business Days following its receipt of a
draft of such proxy statement from R&A).  The Acquirer shall cooperate and
assist R&A in all commercially reasonable respects in connection with such
proxy solicitations and the Fund Board Approvals (including, without
limitation, by providing to R&A all information relating to the Acquirer and
its Affiliates necessary in connection with the foregoing, which information
the Acquirer agrees shall be accurate and complete in all material respects
at the time it is provided and at the time it is used in connection with the
foregoing).

		(b)   As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date hereof, R&A shall (i) cause each of the Private Fund Clients of RMC to
provide written notice to its limited partners or members (as applicable)
as of the date hereof of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii)
request that Chase Manhattan of Wyoming provide written notice to each of
the Private Fund Clients of R&A of the transactions contemplated hereby and
cause each such Private Fund Client to provide written notice to its members
as of the date hereof.  The written consent of each such limited partner or
member (as applicable) for purposes of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be solicited pursuant to such notices, and any limited partner or
member (as applicable) declining to give such written consent shall be
given the opportunity pursuant to such notice to withdraw its investment
from the applicable Private Fund Client prior to the Closing.  The parties
hereto agree that the requisite consent of each Private Fund Client for
purposes of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to have
been obtained upon the receipt of the written consent of such portion in
interest of the limited partners or members (as applicable) of such Private
Fund Client as is required under the Constituent Documents of
such Private Fund Client, as reasonably determined by R&A or RMC (as
applicable) (with respect to each such Private Fund Client, its "Private
Fund Consent"). The Acquirer shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to
review the form of notice and consent materials to be used in connection
with such consent solicitation.

		3.4   Authorization from Others.  R&A will use its
reasonable best efforts (except to the extent another standard is provided
in this Agreement with respect to any particular authorizations, consents
or approvals) to obtain all authorizations, consents and approvals of other
Persons required to be obtained by it (including any such authorizations,
consents or approvals required to be obtained by RFS) to permit the
consummation by R&A of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
R&A shall file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission and
the United States Department of Justice, as promptly as possible
following the date of this Agreement, any notifications required to be
filed by the "ultimate parent entity" of R&A under the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby. R&A will use its reasonable best
efforts to assist the Acquirer in responding to any requests for additional
information made by either of such agencies in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, to assist the Acquirer in causing the
waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest
possible date, and to assist the Acquirer in resisting vigorously any
assertion that the transactions contemplated hereby constitute a violation
of the antitrust laws, all to the end of expediting consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

		3.5   Conduct of Business.  Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing, except as described in Schedule 3.5, or in
connection with the removal from RMC of RMC Excluded Assets, or as otherwise
expressly required by the terms of this Agreement, without the consent of
the Acquirer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed by the

an aggregate amount not to exceed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
($250,000) per quarter, or (ii) distribute to its shareholders any items of
tangible property; prior to the Closing, R&A, the R&A Shareholders and the
Acquirer shall effect those transactions with respect to real property in
the manner described on Schedule 3.5(b) hereto (with the documentation
relating to such transactions to be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to each such Person who is a party thereto and to the
Acquirer); the R&A Shareholders shall reimburse R&A on an after-tax basis
for any transfer taxes, fees and duties and any corporate income taxes
imposed on R&A resulting from the conveyances of real property contemplated
by this Section 3.5(b);

		 (c)   Neither R&A nor RFS will incur any indebtedness
(as defined under GAAP), including without limitation any liability

obligations of others, except gross debt for borrowed money to the extent
it replaces existing outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money and is
incurred in the ordinary course of business;

		 (d)   R&A will not make, or incur any obligation to make,
a change in its Constituent Documents;

business, or will enter into any new or materially amended bonus plan,
profit sharing plan, retirement plan, deferred income plan, employment
agreement or other similar arrangement, except for any of the foregoing

at will by R&A or RFS (as applicable);

		 (g)   Neither Royce Company nor RFS will settle any
material litigation except in the ordinary course of business;

respect to bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or similar status;

		 (i)   Except with respect to R&A's election to be taxed as

limitations in respect of taxes, amend any tax return in any material
respect, enter into any closing agreement with respect to any material tax
or settle any material tax claim or assessment (in each case except to the
extent required by law), or materially change any method or principle of
accounting in a manner inconsistent with past practice (except to the extent
required by GAAP);

		 (k)    Neither Royce Company nor RFS will enter into any
transaction with any R&A Shareholder or any of their respective Affiliates

who is a party to an Employment Agreement;

		 (l)    Neither Royce Company nor RFS will acquire for its
own account control or ownership of, or any other equity or other ownership

		  (m)   Neither Royce Company nor RFS will permit any
insurance policy covering the Royce Companies or RFS or naming them as a

the coverage thereunder to lapse, in each case unless simultaneously with
such termination or cancellation, replacement policies, obtained by such
Person in its name or otherwise providing such Person with substantially
the same coverage, are in full force and effect, except for any failures of
the foregoing which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Royce Companies; and

prior to the Closing, which financial statements shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except that they need not include footnotes).

		  3.7     Access.  Until the Closing, each Royce Company
shall afford to the Acquirer and its representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours and with reasonable notice, to the properties
and records of such Royce Company (including without limitation, in the
case of R&A, those of RFS) and to the professional advisers to the Royce
Companies, in each case in order that the Acquirer may have the opportunity
to make such reasonable investigation as it shall desire for purposes
consistent with this Agreement.  No investigation by the Acquirer,
R&A or any R&A Shareholder heretofore or hereafter made shall affect the
representations and warranties of the parties under this Agreement, and
each such representation and warranty shall survive any such investigation
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

<Page> 33


		  3.8     Consummation of Agreement.  Each Royce Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts (except to the extent another standard
is provided for in this Agreement with respect to particular actions to be
taken by such Royce Company) to perform and fulfill all conditions and
obligations to be performed and fulfilled by it under this Agreement, to
the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be fully
carried out.

		  3.9     Cooperation of R&A.  R&A shall (and shall cause
RMC to) cooperate with  all reasonable requests of the Acquirer in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
the making of any filings required to be made by the Acquirer in
connection therewith (including without limitation filings required to be
made under the HSR Act).

		  3.10    Updated Representations and Warranties.  From the
ate of this Agreement to the Closing, R&A shall promptly inform the Acquirer
in writing if it shall have discovered any information (whether existing as
of the date of this Agreement or arising after the date hereof) which would
cause the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) hereof not to be satisfied
if the Closing were scheduled to occur as of the date of R&A's discovery of
such information; provided, however, that no such disclosures shall be deemed
to modify, amend or supplement the representations and warranties of R&A
for purposes of any provision of this Agreement except
to the extent provided in Section 8.3 hereof.

		  3.11    Closing Bonus Payments.  All payments required to
be made to employees of R&A pursuant to the Closing Bonus Agreements shall
be paid to such employees in cash prior to the end of business on the Closing
Date, and the R&A Shareholders shall in the aggregate contribute to the
capital of R&A in cash such portion of the Closing Purchase Price as is
required to enable R&A to make such cash payments to employees pursuant to
the Closing Bonus Agreements while remaining in compliance with the closing
condition set forth in Section 6.7 hereof (with the capital contribution
required to be made by each R&A Shareholder being in proportion to such R&A
Shareholder's respective portion of the aggregate Closing Purchase
Price paid to the R&A Shareholders at the Closing).  All payments made to
employees of R&A pursuant to the Closing Bonus Agreements shall, for all
purposes (including without limitation the filing of all Tax Returns), be
deemed by the parties hereto (and the Acquirer so covenants and agrees) as
having been paid to such employees as of immediately prior to the Closing
and in respect of past services provided to R&A by such employees, and the
parties hereto agree to treat such payments in all respects as having been
so made in respect of past services and as having been made while R&A was
an S corporation (and the R&A Shareholders therefore shall be entitled to
any deductions arising in connection with such payments).  Prior to making
the payments required to be made pursuant to the Closing Bonus Agreement,
R&A shall provide the Acquirer with reasonable notice with respect to the
amounts intended to be withheld by R&A from the gross amount of such
payments pursuant to applicable Tax laws, and shall reflect the reasonable
comments of the Acquirer with respect to the amounts actually withheld in
connection with the making of such payments.

		  3.12    Restricted Activities of CMR .  As an inducement
to the Acquirer to enter into this Agreement, in consideration of the
benefits to be derived by CMR under this Agreement, and to preserve the

<Page> 34

goodwill associated with the business of R&A, CMR hereby agrees to the
following restrictions on CMR's business activities that are not on behalf
of R&A and its Affiliates:

		  (a)     As a separate and independent covenant, CMR agrees
that, during the Restricted Period (as defined below), CMR shall not
directly or indirectly, whether for his own account or for the account of
any other person, firm, corporation, or other business organization,
(i) provide Investment Advisory Services (as defined below) to any Client
(as defined below), (ii) make any statements or take any actions that would
reasonably be expected to materially interfere with R&A's or an Affiliate's
business relationships with any Client; (iii) contact (either
directly or indirectly) any Client for the purposes of inducing the client
to, or otherwise induce or attempt to induce any Client to, enter into any
investment management relationship or place any funds or securities under
management with any person or firm other than R&A or an Affiliate
relating to investments of any type, (iv) endeavor to entice away from R&A
any person who is, or was at any time during the one year prior to such
attempt, employed by R&A or an Affiliate, as an officer, portfolio manager,
trader, analyst or salesperson or (v) take any actions that would reasonably
be expected to materially interfere with R&A's property rights in lists of
Clients or otherwise materially diminish the value of such lists to R&A;
provided, however, that this Section 3.12(a) shall not prohibit any firm,
corporation or other business organization of which CMR is an employee
(or otherwise associated) from engaging in such activities, so long as CMR
did not cause or induce such activities, has no participation in such
activities  and did not facilitate such activities through the provision of
information or otherwise; and provided, further, that this Section 3.12(a)
is not intended to restrict (i) general solicitations made to the public or
advertisements placed in publications of general circulation or (ii) "cold
calls," "form letters" or similar types of untargeted solicitations.

		  The term "Restricted Period" shall mean the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending the later of (i) the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) two (2) years after the termination
of CMR's employment with R&A; provided, however, that if CMR's employment
with R&A is terminated by R&A without "Cause" (as such term is defined in
his Employment Agreement), or is terminated by CMR for "Good Reason"
(as such term is defined in his Employment Agreement), the Restricted Period
shall end on the fifth anniversary of the Closing
Date.

		  The term "Investment Advisory Services" shall mean
investment consulting, the rendering of investment advice to institutional
or individual clients, the management of publicly traded securities for
institutional or individual accounts, asset management and all other
services which are customarily provided by persons or entities registered
as investment advisers under the Advisers Act; provided, however, that such
term shall not include "Permitted Activities" (as such term is defined in
CMR's Employment Agreement).

		  The term "Client" shall mean (i) all persons or entities,
who are or were recipients of Investment Advisory Service s from R&A, RMC or
RFS or any of their subsidiaries at the date of termination of CMR's
employment with R&A or at any time during the one (1) year preceding the
date of such termination of employment, including without limitation (A) all
such clients who are investment companies or other collective investment
vehicles (other than an Excluded RMC Fund, if any), (B) all partners and
other investors during such period in any such client that is a collective
investment vehicle that is not a registered investment company (other
than partners or other investors in any Excluded RMC Fund), and (C) any
person or entity who is a shareholder during such period of any such client

<Page> 35

that is a registered investment company who held shares having a market
value of at least $1 million (but such term shall exclude any other
shareholder of a registered investment company), (ii) any persons or
entities who have been identified and specifically contacted by an employee
of R&A, RMC, or RFS with an offer to provide Investment Advisory Services
at any time during the one (1) year preceding the date of termination of
CMR's employment with R&A and who are either named on a list given to CMR
within ten (10) days after his termination of employment or otherwise known
by CMR to have been so contacted, and (iii) any persons or entities known
by CMR to be Affiliates of such current, former or prospective clients.
The term "Client" shall not include (i) any member of  CMR's immediate
family, as defined under Rule 16a-1 of the Exchange Act or (ii) any trust of
which CMR or any member of his immediate family is a grantor or beneficiary
(as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) (or similar types of
related persons or entities).

		  (b)   As a separate and independent covenant, CMR agrees
that, during the Restricted Period, CMR shall not, either for CMR's own
account or on behalf of any person or entity with which CMR is associated
or affiliated, without prior written approval from the Board
of R&A, directly or indirectly, own, share in the earnings of, or invest in
the stock, bonds, or other securities of any person, firm or business
organization which does or attempts to do any of the activities described
in Section 3.12(a), except in accordance with the "Employee Investment
Criteria" set forth below; provided, however, that this Section 3.12(b)
shall not be applicable to (i) Permitted Activities, (ii) continued
ownership by CMR of those investments set forth on Schedule C to his
Employment Agreement, and any other investments acquired by CMR with
the prior written approval of the Board of R&A, (iii) investments in the
securities of open- or closed-end registered investment companies, (iv)
passive investments made in the securities of any collective investment
vehicle that is not registered as an investment company; provided that
CMR's investment in any such private fund does not exceed 10% of the
aggregate investments made therein, or (v) owning any of the foregoing
interests in any collective investment vehicle sponsored or managed by CMR
to the extent such activities are not otherwise prohibited by the
first sentence of Section 3.12(c).  For purposes hereof, "Employee
Investment Criteria" shall mean an investment in stocks, bonds or other
securities which meets both of the following criteria:  (a) such stock,
bonds or other securities are listed on any national, regional, or foreign
securities exchange or have been registered under Section 12(g) of the
Exchange Act; and (b) such investment does not equal or exceed, in the case
of any class of the capital stock of any one issuer, two and a half percent
(2.5%) of the issued and outstanding shares, or, in the case of bonds or
other securities, two and a half percent (2.5%) of the aggregate principal
amount thereof issued and outstanding.

		  (c)     As a separate and independent covenant, CMR
covenants and agrees that during any portion of the Restricted Period that
follows the termination of CMR's employment with R&A, CMR shall not directly
or indirectly, whether for his own account or for the account of any other
person, firm, corporation, or other business organization, engage in the
business of providing or soliciting to provide Investment Advisory Services
of any type to any person or entity located in the United States.
In addition, CMR covenants and agrees that, during the period specified in
this Section 3.12(c), CMR shall not, either for CMR's own account or on
behalf of any person or entity with which CMR is associated or affiliated,
without the prior written approval of the Board of R&A, directly or

<Page> 36

indirectly be employed by, provide consulting services to, own, share in
the earnings of, or invest in the stock, bonds, or other securities of any
person, firm or business organization which does or attempts to do any of
the activities described above in this Section 3.12(c), except in accordance
with the Employee Investment Criteria set forth in Section 3.12(b).  To the
extent that the provisions contained in this Section 3.12(c) are
more restrictive than the covenants contained in Section 3.12(a) or
Section 3.12(b), the parties intend that this Section 3.12(c) shall control
and shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 3.12(c) shall not be applicable
to (i) Permitted Activities, (ii) continued ownership by CMR of those
investments set forth on Schedule C to his Employment Agreement, and any
other investments acquired by CMR with the prior written approval of the
Board of R&A, (iii) investments in the securities of open- or closed-end
registered investment companies, (iv) passive investments made in the
securities of any collective investment vehicle that is not registered as
an investment company; provided that CMR's investment in any such private
fund does not exceed 10% of the aggregate investments made therein, (v)
owning any of the foregoing interests in any collective investment vehicle
sponsored or managed by CMR to the extent such activities are not otherwise
prohibited by the first sentence of this Section 3.12(c), or (vi) engaging
in the sponsoring and/or managing of any Excluded RMC Fund (provided that
no such Excluded RMC Fund shall accept investments from new investors
therein to the extent its net assets exceed $50 million at any time prior
to the end of the Restricted Period).

		  (d)     CMR and R&A agree that the periods of time and
the scope applicable to the covenants of Sections 3.12(a), 3.12(b) and
3.12(c) are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business
interests of R&A without unduly limiting CMR's ability to obtain employment
or otherwise earn a living at the same general level of economic benefit as
anticipated by his Employment Agreement.  However, if such period or scope
should be adjudged unreasonable in any judicial or other dispute resolution
proceeding, then the period of time or scope shall be reduced by the extent
deemed unreasonable, so that these covenants may be enforced during such
period and for such scope as are adjudged to be reasonable.

		  (e)      It is understood by and between CMR and R&A that
the covenants by CMR set forth in this Section 3.12 are an essential element
of this Agreement and that, but for the agreement of CMR to comply with such
covenants, R&A would not have entered into CMR's Employment Agreement and
the Acquirer and the R&A Shareholders would not have entered into this
Agreement.

on the Acquirer or (ii) a Material Adverse Effect on the Royce Companies
following the Closing.

	       4.6    Consent Solicitation Materials.  All information
provided in writing by or on behalf of the Acquirer for use in the

broker's commission or finder's fee in connection with the transactions

<Page> 39

		(a) During the Revenue Sharing Period, the Acquirer
shall at all times cause Board Approval of the following (and shall not
otherwise affirmatively prevent the following from occurring):

		(i)     R&A shall maintain the Royce & Associates, Inc.
	Deferred Compensation Plan and the Royce & Associates, Inc.
	Incentive Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the "Deferred
	Compensation Plans") and discharge the obligations of R&A under
	the Deferred Compensation Plans existing as of immediately prior
	to the Closing (provided that any new post-Closing grants
	thereunder shall be made only in the discretion of the Board of
	R&A); provided, however, that each of the Deferred Compensation
	Plans shall be amended prior to the Closing to reflect that the
	obligations of R&A thereunder are to be funded solely out of
	Retained Operating Revenues following the Closing, with such
	amendments to become effective as of (and subject to)
	the Closing (and R&A shall use its reasonable best efforts to
	obtain any necessary consents of participants in the Deferred
	Compensation Plans to the extent necessary under the terms of such
	plans to effect such amendments); and

		    (ii)    R&A meeting its contractual obligations under
	each of the Employment  Agreements.

		(b)     To the extent that any employee of either of the
Royce Companies, RFS or any of the Proprietary Fund Clients as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the "Affected Employees") participates
in employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by the Acquirer
or any of its subsidiaries (including without limitation R&A), the
Acquirer (to the extent permitted under the terms of such employee
benefit plans or arrangements, in the case of any such plans or
arrangements other than those maintained by R&A) shall (or in the case
of  any such plan or arrangement maintained by R&A, the Acquirer shall
cause Board Approval of any recommendation by the Management Committee
to):

		(i)     Give such Affected Employee full credit
for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accrual
(except for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension
plan) under such employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained
by the Acquirer or any of its subsidiaries in which such Affected
Employee participates for such Affected Employee's aggregate
service with either of the Royce Companies or RFS or any of the
Proprietary Fund Clients to the same extent recognized by the Royce
Companies or RFS immediately prior to the Closing;

(ii)    waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
Affected Employee under any welfare benefit plans in which such
Affected Employee is eligible to participate after the Closing;
and

<Page> 40

(iii)   provide such Affected Employee with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any welfare plans that such Affected Employee is eligible to
participate in after the Closing Date.

		       5.3     Section 15 of the Investment Company Act.
The Acquirer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
following to be true regarding Section 15(f) of the Investment Company
Act with respect to each Proprietary Fund Client:  (a) For a period of
not less than three years following the Closing, no more than twenty-
five percent (25%) of the members of the board of directors or trustees
(as applicable) of such Proprietary Fund Client shall be "interested
persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of the Acquirer,
R&A, any R&A Shareholder or any of their respective Affiliates; and (b)
for a period of not less than two years following the Closing, neither
the Acquirer nor any Affiliate of the Acquirer which acts as an adviser
to such Proprietary Fund Client shall have any express or implied
understanding, arrangement or intention to impose an "unfair burden"
(within the meaning of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act) on
such Proprietary Fund Client as a result of the transactions
contemplated herein or shall impose such an unfair burden; provided,
however, that the Acquirer shall not be deemed responsible hereunder
with respect to a failure of any of the foregoing to be true to the
extent that such failure resulted from (i) modifications to existing
contractual arrangements (or the imposition of new contractual
arrangements) between R&A or RFS and any such Proprietary Fund Client
following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing (other
than the contractual arrangements contemplated by this Agreement) or
(ii)the unilateral actions of CMR following the Closing taken without
Board Approval.

		       5.4     Authorization from Others.  The Acquirer
will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all authorizations,
consents and approvals of other Persons required to be obtained by it to
permit the consummation by the Acquirer of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Acquirer shall file or cause to be filed with the
Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice,
as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
notifications required to be filed by the "ultimate parent entity" of
the Acquirer under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby.  The Acquire will use its reasonable best efforts to
respond to any requests for additional information made by either of such
agencies, to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or
expire at the earliest possible date, and to resist vigorously any
assertion that the transactions contemplated hereby constitute a violation
of the antitrust laws, all to the end of expediting consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

			5.5     Consummation of Agreement.  The Acquirer
shall use its reasonable best efforts (except to the extent another
standard is provided for in this Agreement with respect to particular
actions to be taken by the Acquirer) to perform and fulfill all
conditions and obligations to be performed and fulfilled by it under
this Agreement, to the end that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be fully carried out.

			 5.6     Cooperation of the Acquirer.  The
Acquirer shall cooperate (and shall cause its Affiliates to cooperate)
with all reasonable requests of R&A in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and the making of any filings
required to be made by the Royce Companies, RFS or any of the R&A
Shareholders in connection therewith (including without limitation
filings required to be made under the HSR Act).

5.7     Indemnification and Insurance.  During the
	Earnout Period:

<Page> 41

			 (a)    The Acquirer shall not take any action
that would cause any rights of indemnification existing in favor of the
R&A Shareholders and the directors, officers, partners and employees of
the Royce Companies, RFS and the Proprietary Fund Clients, in each case
as in effect on the date hereof, as against R&A and RFS, and shall not
take any action that would cause any such rights of indemnification
existing in favor of such Persons as against the Proprietary Fund
Clients and the Private Fund Clients (in each case including without
limitation in any such Persons' capacity as a director, trustee,
officer, employee, agent or other representative of any Proprietary Fund
Client or Private Fund Client), to not survive the Closing
and continue in full force and effect against R&A, RFS or the applicable
Proprietary Fund Client or Private Fund Client, as applicable, in
accordance with the terms of such rights as in effect on the date hereof
with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the date of the Closing
(including without limitation matters relating to the consideration,
negotiation, approval and execution of the transactions contemplated
hereby), and the Acquirer shall at all times during the Earnout Period
cause the Constituent Documents of R&A and RFS to reflect the matters
set forth in this Section 5.7(a) (to the extent currently so reflected
in such Constituent Documents); provided, however, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, no R&A Shareholder shall be entitled to
indemnification under any of the foregoing rights of indemnification in
respect of indemnification payments made by such R&A Shareholder to
Acquirer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement;
and

			 (b)     R&A, RFS and New RMC shall provide
(with the costs thereof to be funded solely out of Retained Operating
Revenues), and R&A shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Proprietary Fund Clients to provide, (in each case except to
the extent that the CMR Representative and the Acquirer shall otherwise
mutually agree in writing) that portion of directors/trustees and
officers, errors and omissions and any similar existing liability
insurance that serves to reimburse the R&A Shareholders, R&A, RMC, RFS
and/or the partners, directors, officers and employees of R&A, RFS, RMC
and the Proprietary Fund Clients (including without limitation in any
such Persons' capacity as a director, trustee, officer, employee, agent
or other representative of any Proprietary Fund Client) with respect to
claims against such Persons arising from facts or events which occurred
on or before the date of the Closing, which insurance shall contain at
least the same coverage and amounts, and otherwise contain terms and
conditions not less advantageous in the aggregate, as that coverage
provided by R&A, RFS, RMC and the Proprietary Fund Clients (as
applicable) for such Persons as of the date of this Agreement.

			 5.8     Structural Covenants Related to
Contingent Payments.  During the Earnout Period (except to the extent
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Acquirer and the CMR
Representative), the Acquirer shall, on a reasonable basis consistent
with the practices of the Acquirer and its Affiliates (other than R&A
and its subsidiaries), (i) oversee the operation of the business of R&A
and its subsidiaries in good faith with the objective of (A) building
and maintaining a successful investment management business and (B)
subject to the exercise by the Board of Directors of R&A in good faith
of its rights under Section 2(d) of the Revenue Sharing Agreement,
supporting R&A's and the R&A Shareholders' efforts to achieve the
Contingent Payments provided for in Section 1.7 hereof consistent with
R&A's and its subsidiaries' efforts to pursue and develop small- and
micro-cap equity asset management products and services, (ii) not
compromise the structural integrity of R&A and its subsidiaries
(including without limitation their reporting relationships, for so long
as CMR is the President of R&A) in a manner that could reasonably be

<Page> 42


expected to interfere with the achievement of the Contingent Payments
provided for in Section 1.7 hereof, and (iii) in the event that a
revenue-producing product or service nonetheless is to be removed from
the consolidated revenues of R&A, ensure that R&A is given revenue
credit (based upon the trailing twelve (12) months' revenues produced by
such product or service at the time of transfer) for future periods for
purposes of the calculation of Contingent
Payments hereunder.

			  5.9     Updated Representations and
Warranties.  From the date of this Agreement to the Closing, the
Acquirer shall promptly inform R&A in writing if it shall have
discovered any information (whether existing as of the date of this
Agreement or arising after the date hereof) which would cause the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) hereof not to be satisfied
if the Closing were scheduled to occur as of the date of the Acquirer's
discovery of such information; provided, however, that no such
disclosures shall be deemed to modify, amend or supplement the
representations and warranties of the Acquirer for purposes of any
provision of this Agreement except to the extent provided in Section 8.3
hereof.

			  5.10    Excluded RMC Funds.  Promptly
following the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, with respect to
each Excluded RMC Fund the Acquirer shall cause R&A and New RMC to use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents of the
investors in such Excluded RMC Fund as are legally required to permit
the transfer to such Person as is designated by the CMR Representative
to the Acquirer in writing (or, in the absence of such a designation, to
the CMR Representative) of the sole general partnership interest (and
any other similar controlling interests) in such Excluded RMC Fund (and
consent to the related transactions provided for in this Section 5.10).
Promptly following the receipt of any legally required investor consents
described in the preceding sentence, the Acquirer shall cause the
business of acting as the general partner of such Excluded RMC Fund
(including without limitation all of the goodwill and other intangible
property associated therewith, but excluding any rights to receive
payments of fees and expense reimbursements from such Excluded RMC Fund
with respect to periods preceding the fifth anniversary of the Closing
Date and excluding that portion of the capital account of New RMC in
such Excluded RMC Fund that is in excess of one percent (1.0%) of the
aggregate capital account balances of the partners in such Excluded RMC
Fund) to be transferred by R&A and New RMC to such transferee as was
designated by the CMR Representative (or to the CMR Representative, in
the absence of such a designation), and the sole consideration payable
by such transferee in respect of such transfer shall be an assumption by
such transferee of liabilities relating to the operation of such
Excluded RMC Fund arising under its Constituent Documents on or after
the date of the transfer to such transferee.  The written consent of
each investor in an Excluded RMC Fund for purposes of the transactions
described in this Section 5.10 shall be solicited pursuant to written
notice sent to such investor, and any investor declining to give such
written consent shall be given the opportunity pursuant to such notice
to withdraw its investment from the applicable Excluded RMC Fund.  The
CMR Representative shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review
the form of notice and consent materials to be used in connection with
such consent solicitation.

			  5.11   Location of Offices.  During the
Earnout Period (except to the extent otherwise agreed to in writing by
the Acquirer and the CMR Representative), the Acquirer shall cause the
principal business offices of R&A and its subsidiaries to remain in
Manhattan, New York and (for so long as CMR remains an employee of R&A
or any of its subsidiaries) Greenwich, Connecticut.

<Page> 43


			  5.12    Acquirer Right to Substitute Wholly-
Owned Subsidiaries.  By written notice delivered by the Acquirer to R&A
not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Acquirer
shall have the right (subject to Section 5.8(ii) hereof) to substitute
in its place any one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Acquirer
solely for purposes of (a) effecting the delivery of the payments
required to be delivered by the Acquirer pursuant to Section 1.2(b) at
the Closing and pursuant to Section 1.7 in connection with Contingent
Payments and (b) acquiring and holding the shares of capital stock of
R&A following the Closing (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,
any such substitution shall not change the definition of "Acquirer
Shares" hereunder, which shall continue to be shares of capital stock of
Legg Mason, Inc. notwithstanding any such substitution); provided,
however, that the Acquirer shall be required, as a condition to any such
substitution, to make written representations and warranties to R&A and
the R&A Shareholders with respect to each such wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Acquirer in substance equivalent to the representations and
warranties of the Acquirer set forth in Section 4 hereof (other than
those set forth in Section 4.7 hereof), and such representations and
warranties shall be deemed to be representations and warranties made by
the Acquirer under this Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement
(including without limitation the closing conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 hereof); and provided, further, that, notwithstanding any
such substitution of wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Acquirer pursuant
to this Section 5.12, all of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of the Acquirer under this Agreement shall remain joint
and several obligations of the Acquirer from and after any such
substitution notwithstanding such substitution (and the Acquirer shall
be obligated to discharge any and all such obligations to the extent not
discharged by such subsidiaries of the Acquirer in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement).  Any promissory notes and other documentation
between R&A and the Acquiror (or any of its other Affiliates) relating
to debt incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Acquiror and
the CMR Representative.

Parties for any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Acquirer contained herein to the extent that (i) such
breach occurred prior to or as of the Closing, (ii) such breach was
identified by the Acquirer to R&A in writing prior to the Closing and
(iii) such breach caused one or more of the conditions set forth in
Section 7 hereof to not be satisfied as of the Closing, and (b) the R&A
Shareholders shall not have any liability to any Acquirer Indemnified
Parties for any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein to the extent that (i) such breach occurred
prior to or as of the Closing, (ii) such breach was identified by R&A to
the Acquirer in writing prior to the Closing and (iii) such breach
caused one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 6 hereof to
not be satisfied as of the Closing.

SECTION 9.  TAX MATTERS
		    9.1     Section 338(h)(10) Election.

		    (a)     R&A and the R&A Shareholders will join with
the Acquirer in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
(and any corresponding election under state and local Tax law) with
respect to the Stock Purchase hereunder (the "Elections").  The Acquirer
shall prepare any and all forms necessary to effectuate the Elections
(including, without limitation, IRS Form 8023 and similar forms under
state and local Tax law) (the "Election Forms") and, to the extent
possible, the R&A Shareholders and the Acquirer shall execute, as of the
Closing Date, the Election Forms.  In the event, however, any Election

<Page> 49

Forms are not executed by the Closing Date, the R&A Shareholders and the
Acquirer shall complete each such Election Form no later than 15 days
prior to the date such Election Form is required to be filed. Each of
the R&A Shareholders shall execute the Election Forms and the Acquirer
shall execute and shall duly and timely file the Election Forms in
accordance with applicable Tax Laws and Regulations and the terms of
this Agreement.  The R&A Shareholders will include any income, gain,
loss, deduction or other Tax items resulting from the Elections on their
Tax Returns to the extent permitted by applicable Laws and Regulations.
The R&A Shareholders and the Acquirer shall report all transactions
pursuant to this Agreement in a manner that is consistent with the
Elections and shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to
do so pursuant to a final "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313 of the Code or an analogous provision of state, local or foreign
law.

		   (b)     The Acquirer and the R&A Shareholders have
jointly allocated the Closing Purchase Price (the "Purchase Price
Allocation") among the assets of R&A in accordance with Treas. Reg.
Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d), and such Purchase Price Allocation is set
forth in Schedule 9.1(b).  Any subsequent adjustments to the Closing
Purchase Price and the payment of any Contingent Payments shall be
reflected in the Purchase Price Allocation as revised hereunder in a
manner consistent with Treas. Reg. Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d) and as
agreed to by the Acquirer and the R&A Shareholders at the time of the
payment thereof (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld).  The
Acquirer and the R&A Shareholders agree to (i) be bound by the Purchase
Price Allocation, (ii) act in accordance with the Purchase Price
Allocation in the preparation of financial statements and filing of all
Tax Returns (including filing Form 8594 with its Federal income tax
return for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date) and in the
course of any Tax audit or Tax litigation relating thereto and (iii)
take no position inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation for all
tax purposes, except, in each case, to the extent that there has been a
determination (within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code) contrary
to such position.  Prior to the Closing, the Acquiror shall provide the
CMR Representative with a reasonable opportunity to review the
allocations of purchase price for accounting purposes to tangible items
of property, and reflect reasonable comments thereon.

		    (c)    R&A and the R&A Shareholders shall not revoke
R&A's election to be taxed as an S corporation within the meaning of
Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code, or the comparable elections or status
for New York State franchise tax purposes, and shall not take steps
resulting in the termination of RFS' status as a "qualified subchapter S
subsidiary" within the meaning of Code section 1361(b)(3)(B), or of RFS'
comparable status for New York State franchise tax purposes, prior to the
Closing, and will use their reasonable best efforts to prevent from being
taken any action (other than the sale of the R&A stock pursuant to this
Agreement) that would result in the termination of R&A's status as a validly
electing S corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361
and 1362 of the Code, or RFS' status as a "qualified subchapter S
subsidiary" within the meaning of Code section 1361(b)(3)(B), or of RFS'
comparable status for New York State franchise tax purposes, prior to the
Closing.

		     9.2    Tax Returns and Payments.

		     (a)     Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing
Date.  The CMR Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed in a timely manner all Tax Returns for R&A and
RFS for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing
Tax Periods").  Tax Returns of R&A and RFS not yet filed for any Pre-

<Page> 50


Closing Tax Period shall be prepared, and each item thereon treated, in
a manner consistent with past practices employed with respect to R&A and
RFS (except to the extent counsel for the CMR Representative  or the
Acquirer determines that there is no reasonable basis in law therefore
or determines that a Tax Return cannot be so prepared and filed or an
item so reported without being subject to penalties).

		     (b)     Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending
After the Closing Date.  The Acquirer shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for R&A and RFS
for all periods beginning before and ending after the Closing Date
("Straddle Periods") which are filed after the Closing Date.  The
Acquirer shall permit the CMR Representative to review and comment on
each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to filing
and shall incorporate any such reasonable comments from the CMR
Representative.

		     (c)     Refunds.  The Acquirer shall promptly pay
to the R&A Shareholders (in proportion to their respective receipt of
the Closing Purchase Price) any unaccrued refund or credit of Taxes
(including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) received
by the Acquirer, R&A or RFS relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period.  The Acquirer shall, if the
CMR Representative reasonably so requests, cause R&A or RFS (or any
other relevant entity) to file for any refund or credit to which the R&A
Shareholders believe they are entitled.

		     (d)     Payments.  (i) The R&A Shareholders shall
pay or cause to be paid when due and payable (with any such payment to
be made by the individual R&A Shareholders in the same respective
percentages that the Closing Purchase Price was paid to them) all
unreserved Taxes with respect to R&A and RFS for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and any pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period; and (ii) the
Acquirer shall so pay or cause to be paid Taxes for any Tax periods
commencing on or after the Closing Date and any post-Closing portion of
a Straddle
Period.

		      9.3    Tax Cooperation and Exchange of
Information.  The Acquirer and the R&A Shareholders agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to R&A or RFS
(including, without limitation, access to books and records, employees,
contractors and representatives) as is reasonably necessary for the
filing of all Tax Returns, amended Tax Returns or claim for refund, the
making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for and conduct
of any audit by any taxing authority, and the prosecution or defense of
any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax Return.  Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant
Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules,
related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by Tax authorities at the sole cost of the requesting
party.  If reasonably requested by the Acquirer and at the Acquirer's
sole expense, the CMR Representative shall make himself available on a
basis mutually convenient to both parties to provide explanations of any
documents or information provided hereunder.  The Acquirer and the R&A
Shareholders shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes
pertaining to R&A or RFS in their respective possession (which shall
include, in the case of the Acquirer, books and records in the
possession of R&A or RFS) until the later of (i) the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the Taxable periods to which such Tax Returns

<Page> 51


and other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the
extent notified by the other party in writing of such extensions for the
respective Tax periods prior to such expiration, or (ii) six years
following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns.  At the
end of such period, each party shall provide the others with at least 10
days prior written notice before destroying any such books and records,
during which period the parties receiving such notice can elect to take
possession, at their own expense, of such books and records. The
Acquirer and the R&A Shareholders shall cooperate with each other in the
conduct of any audit or other proceeding related to Taxes involving R&A
or RFS.  Any information provided or obtained under this Section 9.3
shall be kept confidential except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an audit or other proceeding.

		      9.4    Allocation of Taxable Income.  As a result
of the Stock Purchase, R&A and RFS shall be treated as having two short
years for tax purposes during the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs pursuant to Section 1362(e)(1) of the Code: (i) a period from
January 1 of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs through the
end of the day prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) a period from the
beginning of the Closing Date through December 31 of the calendar year
in which the Closing occurs.

SECTION 10.  SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

		     10.1    Survival of Representations, Warranties and
Covenants.  Each of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until the second anniversary of the
date of the Closing, except for the representations and warranties
contained in Section 2.9, which shall survive until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations relating to the subject matter
thereof, and except for the representations and warranties contained in
Section 2.3(a), Section 2.5(a), the first sentence of Section 4.3, and
Section 4.4, which shall survive indefinitely.  Each of the covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement (and the rights of the
parties to seek indemnification under Section 10.2 or 10.4, as
applicable, for a breach of any such covenants or agreements) which by
its terms is to be performed following the Closing shall survive until
fully performed in accordance with its terms.



		     10.2    Indemnification by the R&A Shareholders.
From and after the Closing, each of the R&A Shareholders agrees, jointly
and severally with the other R&A Shareholders (subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 10.3 hereof), with respect to any
breach by R&A occurring as of or prior to the Closing of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of R&A contained in this
Agreement, to indemnify, defend and hold the Acquirer, its Affiliates
and their respective directors, officers and employees (individually a
"Acquirer Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Acquirer
Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any damages,
liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) which may be sustained or
suffered by any of them to the extent arising out of or resulting from
such breach by R&A of such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement occurring as of or prior to the
Closing.

<Page> 52


		     10.3    Limitations on Indemnification by the R&A
Shareholders.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the right of the Acquirer Indemnified Parties to
indemnification under Section 10.2 shall be subject to the following
limitations:

		     (a)     No indemnification shall be payable by the
R&A Shareholders pursuant to Section 10.2 unless the total of all
indemnification payments to be made by the R&A Shareholders pursuant to
Section 10.2 shall exceed two million dollars ($2,000,000) in the
aggregate, whereupon only amounts in excess of such two million dollar
($2,000,000) threshold  shall be recoverable as indemnification payments
hereunder;

		     (b)     The aggregate indemnification payable by
the R&A Shareholders pursuant to Section 10.2 shall be limited to a
maximum of seventy-five million dollars ($75,000,000);

		     (c)     The indemnification payable by any one R&A
Shareholder pursuant to Section 10.2 with respect to any claim shall be
limited to the percentage of the aggregate indemnification liability of
all R&A Shareholders with respect to such claim that equals the
percentage of the Closing Purchase Price received by such R&A
Shareholder; each R&A Shareholder that is a trust covenants to the
Acquirer that, until the second anniversary of the Closing Date (or such
later time as any indemnification claims that have been made by the
Acquirer against such R&A Shareholder as of the second anniversary of
the Closing Date have been finally resolved), such R&A Shareholder will
not distribute any assets to its beneficiaries if such distribution
would result in such R&A Shareholder retaining (as of immediately
following such distribution) assets having a then-current market value
less than that portion of the Closing Purchase Price received by such
R&A Shareholder at the Closing; and

		     (d)     No indemnification shall be payable by the
R&A Shareholders pursuant to Section 10.2 after the expiration of the
applicable survival period set forth in Section 10.1 with respect to the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement giving rise to such
indemnification obligation (the "Indemnification Cut-Off Date");
provided that such expiration shall not affect any claim for
indemnification with respect to which notice was given in the manner
contemplated by Section 10.6 hereof prior to the applicable
Indemnification Cut-Off Date.

		      10.4   Indemnification by the Acquirer.  From and
after the Closing, the Acquirer agrees (subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 10.5 hereof) to indemnify, defend and hold RMC, each
R&A Shareholder, their respective Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers and employees (individually a "Royce Indemnified
Party" and, collectively, the "Royce Indemnified Parties") harmless from
and against any damages, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel)
which may be sustained or suffered by any of them to the extent arising
out of or resulting from a breach by the Acquirer occurring as of or
prior to the Closing of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Acquirer contained in this Agreement.


<Page> 53

		      10.5    Limitation on Indemnification by the
Acquirer.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the right of the Royce Indemnified Parties to indemnification
under Section 10.4 shall be subject to the following limitations:

		      (a)     No indemnification shall be payable by the
Acquirer pursuant to Section 10.4 unless the total of all
indemnification payments to be made by the Acquirer pursuant to Section
10.4 shall exceed two million dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate,
whereupon only amounts in excess of such two million dollar ($2,000,000)
threshold shall be recoverable as
indemnification payments hereunder;

		      (b)     The aggregate indemnification payable by
the Acquirer pursuant to Section 10.4 shall be limited to a maximum of
seventy-five million dollars ($75,000,000); and

		      (c)     No indemnification shall be payable by the
Acquirer pursuant to Section 10.4 after the expiration of the applicable
Indemnification Cut-Off Date; provided, that such expiration shall not
affect any claim for indemnification with respect to which notice was
given in the manner contemplated by Section 10.6 hereof prior to the
applicable Indemnification Cut-Off Date.

		      10.6    Notice; Defense of Claims.  An Acquirer
Indemnified Party shall make any claim for indemnification hereunder by
giving written notice thereof to the CMR Representative, with a copy to
the Acquirer, within the period in which indemnification claims can be
made hereunder, and a Royce Indemnified Party shall make any claim for
indemnification hereunder by giving written notice thereof to the
Acquirer, with a copy to the CMR Representative, within the period in
which indemnification claims can be made hereunder.  If indemnification
is sought for a claim or liability asserted by a third party, the
indemnified party shall also give written notice thereof to the
indemnifying party promptly after it receives notice of the claim or
liability being asserted, but the failure to do so shall not relieve the
indemnifying party from any liability except to the extent that it is
prejudiced by the failure or delay in giving such notice.  Any such
notice shall summarize in reasonable detail the bases for the claim for
indemnification and any claim or liability being asserted by a third
party.

		       Within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving
such notice, the Acquirer or the CMR Representative (as applicable)
shall give written notice to the other stating whether it disputes the
claim for indemnification (which each of the Acquirer and the CMR
Representative shall be exclusively authorized to do on behalf of all of
their respective indemnified parties for purposes of indemnification
under this Agreement) and whether it will defend against any third party
claim or liability at its own cost and expense (such costs and expenses
to be borne ratably by the R&A Shareholders in proportion to their
respective shares of the consideration received at the Closing
hereunder, and promptly reimbursed to the CMR Representative upon his
request). If the Acquirer or the CMR Representative (as applicable)
fails to give notice that it disputes an indemnification claim within
twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of such written notice thereof,
it shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed (on behalf of all of the
applicable indemnifying parties) to the claim, which shall become
immediately due and payable.

			In the case of a claim by an Acquirer
Indemnified Party, the CMR Representative, and in the case of a claim by

<Page> 54

a Royce Indemnified Party, the Acquirer, shall be entitled to direct the
defense against a third party claim or liability for which
indemnification is sought hereunder, with counsel selected by it and
reasonably acceptable to the other, as long as the Acquirer or the CMR
Representative (as applicable) is conducting a good faith defense.  Each
indemnified party shall at all times have the right to participate in
the defense of a third party claim or liability in reasonable respects
and at its own expense directly or through counsel; provided that if the
named parties to the action or proceeding include both the indemnifying
party and one or more indemnified parties and an indemnified party is
advised by counsel in writing that representation of both parties by the
same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct, the indemnified parties may engage one separate
counsel to represent them at the expense of the indemnifying parties.
If no such notice of intent to dispute and defend a third party claim or
liability is given by the Acquirer or the CMR Representative (whichever
is authorized to act on behalf of the indemnifying parties), or if such
good faith defense is not being, or ceases to be, conducted by the
Acquirer or the CMR Representative (as applicable), the other shall have
the right, on behalf of the indemnified parties and at the expense of
the indemnifying parties, to undertake the defense of such claim or
liability (with counsel selected by it and reasonable acceptable to the
indemnifying parties) and to compromise or settle it, exercising
reasonable business judgment (and subject to receipt of a release of the
indemnified parties and the indemnifying parties not becoming subject to
non-monetary penalties, obligations or restrictions as a result
thereof).  If the third party claim or liability is one that by its
nature cannot be defended solely by the indemnifying parties, then the
indemnified parties shall make available such information and assistance
as the indemnifying parties may reasonably request and shall cooperate
with the indemnifying parties in such defense (at the expense of the
indemnifying parties).

		      10.7    No Right of Setoff; Insurance, Tax and
Other Benefits.  In no event shall any party hereto be entitled to
offset any indemnification claim or alleged indemnification claim that
such party may have against another party hereto against any amounts
such indemnified party otherwise is obligated to pay to such potential
indemnitor pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.

		      (b)     The amount of any indemnification payment
to be made by any indemnifying party under this Agreement shall be
reduced to take into account (in assessing the damages, liabilities,
losses, costs and expenses suffered by the indemnified party) any
related tax benefits, insurance recoveries and similar related benefits,
recoveries or payments that such indemnified party has received as a
result of the circumstance, event or occurrence giving rise to such
underlying indemnification claim, and any such related benefits,
recoveries or payments received by an indemnified party hereunder
following its receipt of indemnification payments hereunder shall be
reimbursed to the indemnifying parties to the extent failure to do so
would result in a recovery by the indemnified parties of more than 100%.
In no event shall any party hereto be entitled to collect punitive
damages as part of any indemnification recovery under this
Agreement.

		      (c)     Each party hereto agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maximize its insurance recoveries and
other similar recoveries versus third parties with respect to any
circumstance, event or occurrence which may give rise to indemnification
obligations of other parties hereto, to the extent that such
commercially reasonable efforts could reasonably be expected to result
in a reduction in the indemnification obligations of such other parties
hereto.

<Page> 55

		      10.8    Indemnification Payments.  The parties
hereto agree that (i) any indemnification payment made under this
Section 10, (ii) any distribution of funds to the Acquirer from amounts
deposited in escrow under the terms of this Agreement (to the extent
such escrowed amounts were treated as Purchase Price by the parties
hereto prior to such distribution to the Acquirer), and (iii) any
additional payments required to be made to the Acquirer under Section
1.3(b) hereof, will be treated by all parties hereto on their (and their
relevant Affiliates') Tax Returns as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
paid hereunder.  From and after the Closing, the indemnification
provided for under this Section 10 shall be the exclusive remedy for
monetary damages with respect to breaches of representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
occurring as of or prior to the Closing, and in lieu of any other
remedies for monetary damages for such breaches occurring as of or prior
to the Closing that may be available to the Acquirer Indemnified Parties
and the Royce Indemnified Parties pursuant to any Laws and Regulations;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to limit any party's right to seek monetary recovery under any
applicable Laws and Regulations in the case of fraud by any other party
hereto occurring as of or prior to the Closing; and provided, further,
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit any
party's right to seek injunctive relief; and provided, further, that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit any R&A
Shareholder's rights as a shareholder of the Acquirer, or under
applicable securities Laws and Regulations with respect to such R&A
Shareholder's receipt of Acquirer Common Stock, in the event that the
Acquirer elects to pay a portion of the Purchase Price in Acquirer
Common Stock; and provided, further, that, for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit any party's
remedies (for monetary damages or otherwise) with respect to breaches of
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents occurring after
the Closing.  For purposes of measuring the amount of any damages which
may be sustained or suffered by any indemnified party hereunder arising
out of or resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty
hereunder by another party hereto (but in no event for purposes of
determining whether such representation or warranty was in fact
breached), any limitations contained in the applicable representation or
warranty with respect to "materiality" or a "Material Adverse Effect"
shall be disregarded.

cause the expenses and expenditures of R&A and its subsidiaries to
exceed in current or future periods the Retained Operating Revenues for
such current or future periods, in light of previously existing
commitments or expenses of R&A and its subsidiaries or otherwise, and
any such objection to be deemed to be substantially contemporaneous if

otherwise) or of any direct or indirect parent of R&A, (other than Legg
Mason, Inc.) shall be deemed an assignment by Legg Mason in violation of
the terms of this Section 12.7, unless the ultimate parent of the
purchaser (or other successor entity) shall have agreed in writing to
perform all of the covenants and agreements of Legg Mason, Inc. arising
under this Agreement from and after the date of such transaction
(provided that such written agreement shall not be deemed to release
Legg Mason, Inc. from such covenants and agreements under this Agreement

expressly set forth herein, this Agreement may not be amended or
modified, nor may compliance with any condition or covenant set forth
herein be waived, except by a writing duly and validly executed by the
Acquirer, on the one hand, and prior to the Closing, R&A (which shall be
authorized to amend this Agreement or waive provisions hereof on its own
behalf and on behalf of each of the R&A Shareholders), or following the
Closing, the CMR Representative, on the other hand; provided that, any
such amendment that adversely affects any of the R&A Shareholders other
than CMR (or his estate, if applicable) in a manner different from the

shall require the written consent of such adversely affected R&A
Shareholder.

		    12.12   Publicity and Disclosures.  On each of the
dates of the execution of this Agreement and the Closing, the Acquirer

may make presentations to and engage in discussions, as the Acquirer
deems appropriate, with securities analysts concerning the matters
covered by this Agreement after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the parties hereto, including presentations or discussions
that are made available to the public; provided, however, that CMR shall
be permitted to attend any such presentations and discussions of the
Acquirer.  Except as provided in this Section 12.12, none of the Royce
Companies, the R&A Shareholders, the RMC Partners or the Acquirer,
without the consent (oral or written) of both the Acquirer and the CMR
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), shall
make any announcement, issue any press release or make any disclosure to
any third party, except to its respective counsel, accountants and other
experts, concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, except as may be required by applicable Laws and Regulations
(and then only after providing each of the Acquirer and the CMR

of any such required disclosure, and reflecting any reasonable comments
of either such Person with respect to the content of such
disclosure).
