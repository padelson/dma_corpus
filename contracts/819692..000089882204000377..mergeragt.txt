Time:     7     (a) each share of Company Common Stock (i) held by the
Company as treasury stock or (ii) owned by Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer,
in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and
no payment shall be made with respect thereto; PROVIDED that any shares of
Company Common Stock (A) held by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with any market making or proprietary trading activity or for the
account of clients, customers or other Persons, (B) as to which Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries is or may be required to act as a fiduciary or in a
similar capacity, (C) shares held by Buyer or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such
shares in clauses (A), (B) or (C), "TRUST SHARES") or (D) the cancellation of
which would violate any legal duties or obligations of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, shall not be cancelled but, instead, shall be
treated as set forth in Section 2.03(c) below;   (b) each share of common
stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; and   (c) except as otherwise
provided in this Section 2.03 or as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock as to which appraisal rights have been
exercised, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive in cash
from Buyer an amount equal to $44.50, without interest (the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION").   Section 2.04. SURRENDER AND PAYMENT. Prior to the
Effective Time, Buyer shall appoint an agent, reasonably satisfactory to the
Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger
Consideration certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the
"CERTIFICATES"). Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit or cause to
be deposited with the Exchange Agent in a separate fund established for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid for all of the
Certificates at the Effective Time. Any cash deposited with the Exchange
Agent shall not be used for any purpose other than as set forth in this
Article 2 and shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation in: (A) direct obligations of, or obligations the
principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the
United States of America with a remaining term at the time of acquisition
thereof not in excess of 90 days, (B) money market accounts or certificates
of deposit maturing within 90 days of the acquisition thereof and issued by a
bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States of
America or a State thereof having a combined capital surplus in excess
of $500,000,000 (a "UNITED STATES BANK"), (C) commercial paper issued by a
domestic corporation and given a rating of no lower than A1 by Standard and
Poor\'s Corporation and P1 by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. with a
remaining     8    term at the time of acquisition thereof not in
excess of 90 days or (D) demand deposits with any United States Bank. The
earnings and interest thereon shall be paid to Buyer or as Buyer directs.
Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than seven Business
Days after the Effective Time), Buyer shall send, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock at
the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent)
for use in such exchange.   (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock
represented by each such Certificate. Until so surrendered or transferred, as
the case may be, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective
Time for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration.   (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is
to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i)
either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall
pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d) After the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article 2.   (e) Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section
2.04(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains
unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock six months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Buyer, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Buyer for payment of the Merger Consideration
in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time
when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of    
9    any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, the property of Buyer free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   Section 2.05. COMPANY
EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS; SURRENDER OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK BY EXECUTIVE
OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock which the Company is obligated to
honor, whether through the issuance of shares of Company Common Stock or
otherwise, granted under a Company Equity Compensation Plan (each, a "COMPANY
OPTION"), shall be cancelled and the Company shall pay each holder thereof at
or promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than seven
Business Days after the Effective Time) for each such Company
Option cancelled an amount in cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price of such Company Option by (ii) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject thereto immediately prior to the Effective
Time. In connection therewith, the Company shall provide written notice to
each holder of a then outstanding Company Option (whether or not such Company
Option is then vested or exercisable), that (A) such Company Option shall be,
as at the date of such notice, exercisable in full, (B) such Company Option
shall terminate at the Effective Time and (C) if such Company Option is not
exercised or otherwise terminated on or before the fifth Business Day prior
to the Effective Time, such Company Option shall be treated as set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
all outstanding compensatory Company Common Stock units granted under a
Company Equity Compensation Plan (collectively, "COMPANY UNITS"), including
the 2004 Senior Executive Stock Unit Deferred Compensation Plan and the Stock
Deferred Compensation Plan, shall become fully vested and cease to be subject
to any risk of forfeiture or restriction on transferability. At the Effective
Time, each Company Unit shall be cancelled, and the Company shall pay each
holder thereof at or promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later
than seven Business Days after the Effective Time) for each such Company Unit
cancelled an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i)
the Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject thereto immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (b) The Company
has taken all action as is necessary to provide that (i) from and after the
date of this Agreement, no new participants shall be permitted to enroll in
the Company\'s automatic dividend reinvestment plan (the "Company DRIP") and
the Company shall direct BankBoston N.A., as transfer agent under the Company
DRIP, to stop accepting Authorization Cards (as described in the Company
DRIP) and (ii) no later than three Business Days prior to the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, no further shares of Company Common Stock will be
purchased under the Company DRIP. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and
subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company shall terminate the
Company DRIP.     10      (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall adopt such resolutions that are necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.05.   (d) The board of
directors of the Company shall adopt such resolutions necessary to provide
that the surrender of any Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company
Units by each officer and director of the Company who is subject to Section
16 of the 1934 Act shall be an exempt transaction pursuant to Rule 16b-3
under the 1934 Act.   Section 2.06. DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Dissenting Shareholder
shall demand to be paid the "fair value" of such holder\'s shares of Company
Common Stock, as provided in Section 262 of the Delaware Law, such shares
shall not be converted into or exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration except as provided in this Section 2.06, and the Company
shall give Buyer notice thereof and Buyer shall have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Neither
the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior
written consent of Buyer, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting
Shareholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
the right to dissent, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such
Dissenting Shareholder shall thereupon be treated as though such shares had
been converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.03.  
Section 2.07. ADJUSTMENTS. If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or combination, exchange, subdivision or readjustment of shares,
or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period or issuer
tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted.   Section 2.08. WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the
Surviving Corporation and Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. If the Surviving Corporation or Buyer, as the case may be,
so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Options or Company Units in respect of which the Surviving
Corporation or Buyer, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.   Section 2.09. LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person     11    claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.  
ARTICLE 3  THE SURVIVING CORPORATION   Section 3.01. ALTERNATIVE
TRANSACTION STRUCTURES. Notwithstanding anything that may be deemed to be to
the contrary contained herein, at its election, Buyer may change, and the
Company shall cooperate in such efforts (including, without limitation, by
entering into an appropriate amendment to this Agreement), the method of
effecting the combination with the Company, including to provide for a merger
of the Company into Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer or to substitute any of
Buyer\'s direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Buyer or Merger
Subsidiary organized under the laws of Delaware as a constituent corporation
in the Merger; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of consideration to be issued to holders of shares
of Company Common Stock as provided for in this Agreement, (ii) materially
impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (iii) otherwise adversely affect the stockholders of the
Company.   Section 3.02. CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. The certificate
of incorporation of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended
in accordance with Delaware Law.   Section 3.03. BYLAWS. The bylaws of
Merger Subsidiary in effect at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Delaware Law.  
Section 3.04. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. From and after the Effective
Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in
accordance with applicable law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii)
the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation.     12     ARTICLE 4  REPRESENTATIONS AND

contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the
"COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), the Company represents and warrants to Buyer
that:   Section 4.01. CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND POWER. The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
(collectively, "Permits") required to carry on its business as now conducted,
except for those Permits the absence of which would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly
registered as a financial holding company under the BHC Act. The Company has
heretofore made available to Buyer true and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as currently in
effect.   Section 4.02. CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION. (a) The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Company\'s
corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Company\'s
stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock is the only vote of the holders of any of the
Company\'s capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Merger. This Agreement is a valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors\'
rights and to general equity principles (the "BANKRUPTCY AND EQUITY
EXCEPTION").   (b) At a meeting duly called and held on May 4, 2004, the
Company\'s Board of Directors has (i) unanimously determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the
best interests of the Company\'s stockholders, (ii) unanimously approved and
adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
approved and adopted an amendment to the Rights Agreement to render the
Rights inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) unanimously resolved to recommend approval and
adoption of this Agreement by       13    its stockholders and (iv)
directed that this Agreement be submitted to the Company\'s stockholders for
their adoption.   Section 4.03. GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require
no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency,
official, authority or instrumentality (each, a "GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY"),
domestic, foreign or supranational, other than (i) the filing of a
certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the Secretary of State
of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other
states in which the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) the filing of
an application by Buyer with the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation
(and, in connection with such application, an application with the
Massachusetts Housing Partnership Fund), an application by Buyer on Form FR
Y-3 with the Federal Reserve Board and the other filings and actions listed
in Section 4.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (together, the "REGULATORY
APPLICATIONS"), (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR
Act, (iv) compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1934 Act, and
any other applicable securities laws, whether state or foreign, and (v) any
actions or filings the absence of which would not be reasonably expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. As
of the date of this Agreement, the Company knows of no reason why all
regulatory approvals from any Governmental Authority required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not be
obtained on a timely basis.   Section 4.04. NON-CONTRAVENTION. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the
comparable governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries, assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict
with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any applicable
law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, injunction, order, or
decree applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, require any
consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default, or
an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the termination,
cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled under any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding
upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise,
permit, certificate, approval or other similar authorization affecting, or
relating in any way to, the assets or business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such contraventions,
conflicts and violations referred to in clause (ii) and for such    
14    failures to obtain any such consent or other action, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations, changes, losses or Liens referred
to in clauses (iii) and (iv) that would not be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.  
Section 4.05. CAPITALIZATION. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 360,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 20,000,000 shares

Section 4.06. SUBSIDIARIES. Each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation,
limited liability company or similar corporate entity duly    
15    incorporated, validly existing and in good standing (where such
concept exists) under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, has all
corporate powers and all Permits required to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for those Permits the absence of which would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. All material Subsidiaries of the Company and their respective
jurisdictions of incorporation are identified in the Company 10-K and all
Joint Ventures are identified in Schedule 4.06 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.   (b) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other voting

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect; or   (b) any action taken by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries from the Company Balance Sheet Date through the date of this
Agreement that, if taken     18    during the period from the date of

and federal law and regulation and common law. None of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with
respect to any such fiduciary account that would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect and, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either

or, to the knowledge of the officers of the Company, threatened charge by
any      20    Governmental Authority that any of the Company Finance
Subsidiaries has violated, nor any pending or, to the knowledge of the
officers of the Company, threatened investigation by any Governmental
Authority with respect to possible violations of, any applicable Finance Laws
where such violations would, either individually or in the aggregate,

of its Subsidiaries is a party (each such contract, a "MATERIAL CONTRACT") is
a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Company or its Subsidiary,
as the case may be, and is in full force and effect, except where the failure
to be valid, binding and enforceable and in full force and effect would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is (i) in default or violation of any
term, condition or provision of any Material Contract, except for any
defaults or violations that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
party to, or bound by, any agreement or arrangement (including any agreement
with any Bank Regulator) that (x) expressly limits or otherwise restricts the
ability of the Company or such Subsidiary to compete in, or conduct, any line
of business or to compete with any Person, in each case in any geographic
area or during any period of time, in any material respect, or (y) adversely
affects, in any material respect, the conduct of the Company\'s and its

of its Subsidiaries has paid (or has had  paid on its behalf) or has withheld
and remitted to the appropriate Taxing  Authority all Taxes due and payable

due or where such Taxes are being  challenged in good faith, has established
(or has had established on its  behalf and for its sole benefit and recourse)
in accordance with GAAP an  adequate accrual for all Taxes through the end of
the last period for which  the Company and its Subsidiaries ordinarily record
items on their  respective books;   (iii) the income and franchise Tax
Returns of the Company and its  Subsidiaries through the Tax year ended
December 31, 1999 have been  examined and closed or are Tax Returns with
respect to which the applicable  period for assessment under applicable law,
after giving effect to  extensions or waivers, has expired;   (iv) there is
no claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding or  investigation now pending or
threatened in writing against or with respect  to the Company or its
Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax or Tax asset;   (v) none of the Company

foreign law), as transferee or successor, by  contract, or otherwise; and  
(vi) the Company and its Subsidiaries are not bound by any Tax sharing  or
Tax allocation agreement or arrangement (other than any such agreement  or

the three-year period ending on the date hereof, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries was a distributing corporation or a controlled
corporation in a transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the
Code.   (c) Schedule 4.16(c) contains a list of all jurisdictions (whether
foreign or domestic) in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

(including withholding on amounts paid to or by any Person), together with
any interest, penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed by
any Governmental Authority (domestic or foreign) responsible for the
imposition of any such tax (a "TAXING AUTHORITY"). "TAX RETURN" means any
report, return, document, declaration or other information or filing required
to be supplied to any Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes, including
information returns, any documents accompanying payments of estimated Taxes,
or requesting or accompanying requests for the extension of time in which to

Section 4.17. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. No Company Intellectual Property Right
owned, or to the knowledge of the officers of the Company leased, by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding
judgment, injunction, order, decree or agreement restricting the use thereof
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or restricting the licensing
thereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person, except for
any judgment, injunction, order, decree or agreement which would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since the
Company Balance Sheet Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has been a defendant in any action, suit, investigation or proceeding
relating to, or otherwise has been notified in writing of, any alleged claim
of infringement of any Intellectual Property Right of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that, if determined or resolved adversely in accordance with
the plaintiff\'s demands, would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have no outstanding material claim or suit for any continuing
infringement by any other Person of any Company Intellectual Property
Rights.   Section 4.18. PERSONNEL MATTERS. (a) Section 4.18(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list identifying
each material Employee Plan. Copies of each such Employee Plan and any
amendments thereto have been furnished or made available to Buyer, and copies
of, to the extent applicable, any related trust or funding agreements or
insurance policies, amendments thereto, prospectuses or summary plan
descriptions relating thereto and the most recent annual report (Form 5500
including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto) and tax return (Form 990)
prepared in connection therewith have been furnished or made available to
Buyer. All employees and independent contractors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are employed or provide services within the United States.  
(b) As of December 31, 2003, the fair market value of the assets of
each Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, excluding for these purposes
any accrued but unpaid contributions, exceeded the present value of all
benefits accrued under such Title IV Plan determined on a termination basis
using the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used for the
purpose of funding such Employee Plan. No "accumulated funding deficiency",
as defined      23    in Section 412 of the Code, has been incurred
with respect to any Employee Plan subject to such Section 412, whether or not
waived. No material "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of
ERISA and no event described in Section 4062 or 4063 of ERISA, has occurred
in connection with any Employee Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates has (i) engaged in, or is a successor or parent corporation
to an entity that has engaged in, a transaction described in Sections 4069 or
4212(c) of ERISA or (ii) incurred, or reasonably expects to incur prior to
the Effective Time, (A) any liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in
connection with the termination of, or a complete or partial withdrawal from,
any plan covered or previously covered by Title IV of ERISA or (B) any
liability under Section 4971 of the Code that in either case could reasonably
be expected to become a liability of the Company or any Subsidiary or Buyer
or any of its ERISA Affiliates after the Closing. No condition exists that
could constitute grounds for termination by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation of any Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA. The
assets of the Company and all of its Subsidiaries are not now, nor are they
reasonably expected after the passage of time to be, subject to any material
Lien imposed under Section 412(n) of the Code by reason of a failure of any
of Seller, its Affiliates, the Company or any Subsidiary to make
timely installments or other payments required under Section 412 of the
Code.   (c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any predecessor
thereof contributes to, or in the six years prior to the date hereof has
contributed to, any multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA.   (d) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has either received a favorable determination
letter, or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application
for such determination from the Internal Revenue Service, and the Company is
not aware of any reason why any such determination would reasonably be
expected to be revoked or not be reissued. The Company has made available to
Buyer copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination
letters with respect to each such Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan has been
maintained in material compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including
ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Employee Plan. No material
events have occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that would reasonably
be expected to result in payment or assessment by or against the Company of
any material excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B,
4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code.   (e) No Employee Plan exists that, as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or
in connection with other events), could result in the payment to any current
or former employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries of any money or other property or could result in the
acceleration or provision of any other rights or benefits to any current or
former employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not such payment, right or     
24    benefit would constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. No Employee Plan exists that could give rise to the
payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of
Section 162(m) of the Code, except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liability in respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance
benefits for former or current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
except as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code or as
otherwise required by applicable law.   (g) There has been no amendment to,
or announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its
Affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, an Employee Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such Employee Plan above the level of the expense incurred in
respect thereof for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.   (h) Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or in the six years prior to the
date hereof has been a party to or subject to, or is currently negotiating in
connection with entering into, any collective bargaining agreement or other
contract or understanding with a labor union or organization. Furthermore,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) there are no unfair labor
practice charges or complaints, or representation claims or
petitions, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending before the
National Labor Relations Board and (ii) there are no labor strikes, slowdowns
or stoppages actually pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (i) All
contributions required to be made to any Employee Plan by applicable law or
regulation or by any plan document for any period ending as of the date
hereof have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, are or will be fully accrued
for and reflected as a liability on the most recent financial statements of
the Company.   (j) There is no action, suit, investigation, audit or
proceeding pending against or involving or, to the knowledge of the officers
of the Company, threatened against or involving, any Employee Plan before any
court or arbitrator or any Governmental Authority inside or outside the
jurisdiction of the United States.   (k) The Company and its Subsidiaries
have complied with all applicable laws relating to labor and employment,
including those relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining, unemployment
compensation, worker\'s compensation,      25    equal employment
opportunity, age and disability discrimination, immigration control, employee
classification, information privacy and security, and continuation coverage
with respect to group health plans, except for such compliance the failure of
which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (l) Since December 31, 2003,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has effectuated (i) a "plant
closing" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or one
or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment or
facility of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) a "mass layoff" (as
defined in the WARN Act); or (iii) such other transaction, layoff, reduction
in force or employment terminations sufficient in number (standing alone) to
trigger application of any similar state or local law that could reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.   Section 4.19. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. (a) Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect:   (i) no notice, notification, demand, request for
information,  citation, summons or order has been received, no complaint has
been filed,  no penalty has been assessed, and no investigation, action,
claim, suit,  proceeding or review (or any basis therefor) is pending or, to
the  knowledge of the officers of the Company, is threatened by any
Governmental  Authority or other Person relating to or arising out of any
Environmental  Law;   (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries are and have
been in compliance  with all Environmental Laws (including, without
limitation, the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of  1980) and all Environmental Permits; and   (iii) there
are no liabilities of or relating to the Company or any of  its Subsidiaries
of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent,  absolute, determined,
determinable or otherwise arising under or relating  to any Environmental Law
and there are no facts, conditions, situations or  set of circumstances that
could reasonably be expected to result in or be  the basis for any such
liability.   (b) There has been no environmental investigation, study,
audit, test, review or other analysis conducted of which any of the officers
of the Company has knowledge in relation to the current or prior business of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any property or facility now or
previously owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has
not been delivered to Buyer at least two days prior to the date
hereof.      26      (c) For purposes of this Section 4.19, the
terms "COMPANY" and "SUBSIDIARIES" shall include any entity that is, in whole
or in part, a predecessor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  
Section 4.20. PROPERTY AND LEASES. Except as disclosed in the Company
SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries (a) has good and marketable title to all real property
assets, and good title to all other assets, in each case, reflected in the
latest audited balance sheet included in such Company SEC Documents as being
owned by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or acquired after the date
thereof which are listed on Section 4.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(except properties sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof
listed on Section 4.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or sold after the
date hereof in the ordinary course of business), free and clear of all Liens
of any nature whatsoever, except (i) statutory Liens securing payments not
yet due, (ii) Liens on assets of Subsidiaries of the Company which are banks
incurred in the ordinary course of their banking business and (iii) such
imperfections or irregularities of title and Liens as do not materially
affect the current use of the properties or assets subject thereto or
affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such
properties as currently conducted, and (b) is the lessee of all leasehold
real estate reflected in the latest audited financial statements included in
such Company SEC Documents or acquired after the date thereof which are
listed in Section 4.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (except for those
leases that have expired by their terms since the date thereof, which are
listed on Section 4.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or that expire by
their terms after the date hereof) and is in possession of the properties
purported to be leased thereunder, and each such lease is valid without
material default thereunder by the lessee or, to the knowledge of
the officers of the Company, the lessor.   Section 4.21. DERIVATIVE
TRANSACTIONS. (a) Except as would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
all Derivative Transactions (as defined below) entered into by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries were entered into in accordance with applicable
rules, regulations and policies of any Bank Regulator or other regulatory
authority with jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
in accordance with the investment, securities, commodities, risk management
and other policies, practices and procedures employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and were entered into with counterparties believed at the time
to be financially responsible and able to understand (either alone or in
consultation with their advisers) and to bear the risks of such
Derivative Transactions. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have duly
performed all of their obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the
extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and, to the knowledge
of the officers of the Company, there are no breaches, violations or defaults
or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder except for such
breaches, violations or defaults that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material     
27    Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have adopted
policies and procedures consistent in all material respects with the
publications of Governmental Authorities with respect to their derivatives
program.   (b) For purposes of this Section 4.20, "DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS"
means any swap transaction, option, warrant, forward purchase or sale
transaction, futures transaction, cap transaction, floor transaction or
collar transaction relating to one or more currencies, commodities, bonds,
equity securities, loans, interest rates, credit-related events or conditions
or any indexes, or any other similar transaction or combination of any of
these transactions, including collateralized mortgage obligations or other
similar instruments or any debt or equity instruments evidencing or embedding
any such types of transactions, and any related credit support, collateral or
other similar arrangements related to such transactions; provided, that, for
the avoidance of doubt, the term "Derivative Transactions" shall not include

Company\'s broker-dealer Subsidiaries (the "COMPANY B/DS") are duly
registered as broker-dealers under the 1934 Act and are duly registered,
licensed or qualified as broker-dealers in all jurisdictions where such
registration, licensing or qualification is required in order to conduct its
business, except where the failure to be so registered, licensed or qualified
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each such registration, license or
qualification is in full force and effect and in good standing. Each Company
B/D is in good standing with the National Association of Securities Dealers.
Each Company B/D and each of their managers, directors, officers, employees
and registered persons with respect to their service has been, and is, in
compliance, in the conduct of its business, with all applicable federal,
state, local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules,
judgments, orders or decrees applicable thereto except for such failures to
comply as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The
Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any currently outstanding or
previously communicated customer complaints (whether written or oral)
that are currently subject to, or reasonably likely to result in or become

or the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and neither Buyer, Merger    
28    Subsidiary of any of Buyer\'s Affiliates will be deemed to be an
"Interested Person" or "Related Person" thereunder. The Board of Directors of
the Company has taken or caused to be taken all action so none of Buyer,
Merger Subsidiary or any of Buyer\'s Affiliates will be prohibited from
entering into a "business combination" with the Company or any of its
Affiliates as an "interested stockholder" (in each case as such term is used
in Section 203 of the DGCL), or will be an "Interested Person" or a "Related
Person" under any provision of the Company\'s certificate of incorporation,
as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) The Company has taken all action
necessary to (i) render the Rights issued pursuant to the terms of the Rights
Agreement inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) ensure that (A) neither Buyer, Merger Subsidiary
nor any of their Affiliates is an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the
Rights Agreement) and (B) none of a "Flip-over Transaction or Event", "Flip-
in Date", "Separation Time" or "Stock Acquisition Date" (each as defined in
the Rights Agreement) shall occur by reason of the approval or execution of
this Agreement, the announcement or consummation of the Merger or the
consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   ARTICLE 5  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER  
Buyer represents and warrants to the Company that:   Section 5.01. CORPORATE
EXISTENCE AND POWER. Each of Buyer and Merger Subsidiary is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all corporate powers and all
Permits required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those
Permits the absence of which would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Each of Buyer and Merger
Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect. Buyer has heretofore made available to the Company true and complete
copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Buyer and Merger
Subsidiary as currently in effect. Merger Subsidiary was formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Since the date of its incorporation, Merger Subsidiary has not engaged in any
activities other than in connection with or as contemplated by this
Agreement.   Section 5.02. CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery
and performance by Buyer and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and
the consummation by Buyer and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions
contemplated      29    hereby are within the corporate powers of
Buyer and Merger Subsidiary and have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Buyer, Merger Subsidiary, Holdings and their
Affiliates. This Agreement is a valid and binding agreement of each of Buyer
and Merger Subsidiary enforceable against Buyer and Merger Subsidiary in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.   Section 5.03. GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. The execution,
delivery and performance by Buyer and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and
the consummation by Buyer and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions
contemplated hereby require no action by or in respect of, or filing with,
any Governmental Authority, domestic, foreign or supranational, other than
(i) the filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the
Secretary of State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which Buyer is qualified to do business, (ii)
the Regulatory Applications, (iii)compliance with any applicable requirements
of the HSR Act, (iv) compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1934
Act and any other securities laws, whether state or foreign, and (v) any
actions or filings the absence of which would not be reasonably expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. As
of the date of this Agreement, neither Buyer nor Merger Subsidiary knows of
no reason why all regulatory approvals from any Governmental Authority
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement should not be obtained on a timely basis.   Section 5.04. NON-
CONTRAVENTION. The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer and Merger
Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by Buyer and Merger
Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of
any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Buyer or
Merger Subsidiary or the comparable governing instruments of any of Buyer\'s
other Subsidiaries, assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 5.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of
any provision of any law, rule, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or
decree, require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a
default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both,
could become a default, under, or cause or permit the termination,
cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled
under any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding upon Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit, certificate,
approval or other similar authorization affecting, or relating in any way to,
the assets or business of Buyer and its Subsidiaries or result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for such contraventions, conflicts and violations
referred to in clause (ii) and for such failures to obtain any such consent
or other action, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations, changes, losses or Liens      30    referred to in
clauses (iii) and (iv) that would not be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.   Section
5.05. SEC REPORTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) Buyer has made available to the

each such Holdings SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will
comply, as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, as the case may be.   (c) As of its
filing date (or, if amended or superceded by a filing prior to the date
hereof, on the date of such filing), each Holdings SEC Document filed
pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each such Holdings SEC Document filed
subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.   (d) Each Holdings SEC Document that is a
registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed
pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the date such registration statement or
amendment became effective, did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.   (e)
Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated

stockholders of the Company and at the time the stockholders vote on
adoption of this Agreement, will contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.   Section 5.07. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND COURT

the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect, each of Buyer and its Subsidiaries have
properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary,
including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian,
personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in
accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable state
and federal law and regulation and common law. None of Buyer, any of
its Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with
respect to any such fiduciary account that would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect and, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either

accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.   Section 5.08.

suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of Buyer, threatened against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or

Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from:   (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under Sections 14d-9 and  14e-2 of
the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
that, if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing, modifying  or
qualifying the recommendation to the Company\'s stockholders referred to  in
Section 6.02 hereof in a manner adverse to Buyer or the approval of this 
Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company, Buyer shall have the 
right to terminate this Agreement to the extent set forth in Section 
10.01(c)(i) of this Agreement; and     38     (ii) at any time prior
to, but not after, the time this Agreement is  adopted by the stockholders of
the Company, (A) providing information in  response to a request therefor by
a Person who has made an unsolicited bona  fide written Acquisition Proposal,
if the Board of Directors of the Company  receives from the Person so
requesting such information an executed  confidentiality agreement (other
than standstill provisions) on customary  terms; (B) engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with any Person who  has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Board  of Directors of the Company
receives from such Person an executed  confidentiality agreement (other than
standstill provisions) on customary  terms; or (C) recommending such an
unsolicited bona fide written  Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of
the Company, IF AND ONLY TO THE  EXTENT THAT, (x) in each such case referred
to in clause (A), (B) or (C)  above, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith after  consultation with outside legal counsel that
such action is necessary in  order for its directors to comply with their
respective fiduciary duties  under applicable law, (y) in each case referred
to in clause (B) or (C)  above, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith  (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside counsel) that  such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably
likely to be  consummated, taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory  aspects of the proposal, the likelihood of obtaining financing,
and the  Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a 
transaction more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial 
point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement taking 
into account any change in proposal proposed by Buyer; and (z) in the case 
of clause (C), Buyer shall have had written notice of the Company\'s 
intention to take the action referred to in clause (C) at least three 
business days prior to the taking of such action by the Company; provided,

with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition 
Proposal.   (c) The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to
promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in Section 6.04(a) of
the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.04. The Company agrees that it
will notify Buyer promptly, but in any event within 48 hours if any such
inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers and thereafter shall keep Buyer
informed on a current basis, and, in any event, within 48 hours of any
changes in the status and terms of any such proposals or offers,    
39    including whether any such proposal has been withdrawn or rejected.
The Company also agrees to provide any information to Buyer that it is
providing to another Person pursuant to this Section 6.04 at substantially
the same time it provides it to such other Person and that it will promptly
request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
in connection with its consideration of a transaction with the Company to
return all confidential information furnished prior to the execution of this
Agreement to or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of it or any
of its Subsidiaries. The Company agrees promptly, but in any event, within
five days after the date of this Agreement, to request the return or
destruction of all information and materials provided prior to the date of
this Agreement by it, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives with
respect to the consideration or making of any Acquisition Proposal.   (d)
Notwithstanding anything herein that may be deemed to be to the contrary,
nothing contained in this Section 6.04 shall relieve the Company of its
obligation to call and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting, and hold a
vote of its stockholders, pursuant to Section 6.02.   Section 6.05.

as possible following the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, consult with Buyer on all strategic and operational
matters to the extent such consultation is not in violation of applicable

regarding competition, and does not conflict with Section 6.06 of
this Agreement. Immediately upon the execution of this Agreement, the Company
and Buyer shall establish a transition committee, consisting of
three representatives designated by the Company and three representatives
designated by Buyer (the "TRANSITION COMMITTEE"). During the period from the

as may be mutually agreed upon, among other things, other initiatives
designed to incentivize management and branch staff to increase the deposit

the system conversion. The parties shall also consult and reasonably
cooperate regarding similar matters relating to the Company\'s
loan production offices. More generally, Buyer and the Company shall consult
with each other on the introduction of products and services not currently
offered by the Company which Buyer would expect to make available to
customers following the Effective Time; provided that nothing herein shall
obligate the Company to offer any such products or services prior to the
Effective Time.   Section 6.09. CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS. At least two days

PROVIDED that, each non-executive director of the Company (a "NON-EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR") shall be entitled to direct a portion of the Contribution Amount
equal to $180,000, such donation to be made by the Buyer\'s Foundation in the

exempt entity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code (reasonably satisfactory to
the Buyer\'s Foundation) located in a market served by the Company. Buyer
agrees that if the Merger is not consummated for any reason, Buyer shall
reimburse the Company for such amounts previously contributed by the Company
to such charitable foundation within two Business Days of
termination.      41     ARTICLE 7  COVENANTS OF BUYER   Buyer

obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement.   Section 7.02. DIRECTOR AND
OFFICER LIABILITY. Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the
Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:   (a) From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, any Buyer shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present
and former officers and directors of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
(each an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of
or in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact
that such Indemnified Person is or was such a director or officer, and
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions
occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the fullest extent
permitted by Delaware Law or any other applicable laws or provided under the
Company\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date
hereof (including the advancement of expenses); provided that such
indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time
under applicable law.   (b) For a period of six years after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide officers\' and directors\' liability insurance in
respect of actual or alleged acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Person currently covered by the
Company\'s officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policy on terms
with respect to coverage and amount and conditions no less favorable than
those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided that, in
satisfying its obligation under this Section 7.02(b), the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 250%
of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which
amount the Company has disclosed to Buyer prior to the date hereof (such 250%
amount, the "MAXIMUM ANNUAL PREMIUM"); PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. In
addition, the Company may (after      42    consultation with Buyer)
purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy prior to the Effective Time on
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons than the
existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the
Company; provided, that the aggregate amount paid by the Company shall not
exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If such "tail" prepaid policies have been
obtained by the Company prior to the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such
policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
respective obligations thereunder, and all other obligations under this
Section 7.02(b) shall terminate.   (c) If Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.02.  
(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under Delaware Law or any other applicable laws or under any agreement of
any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These
rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and his or her heirs
and representatives.   Section 7.03. BENEFIT PLANS. () From the Effective
Time through December 31, 2004 (the "BENEFITS TRANSITION DATE"), Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "COVERED

employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements (other

Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to such employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Benefits Transition Date, Buyer shall, or

intention to terminate or freeze such plan;   (ii) from and after the
Effective Time, Buyer\'s obligation under the  first two sentences of this

in effect at the Company, as  described in Section 7.03 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; and   (iii) a Covered Employee who is terminated
without cause (definition  to be mutually agreed to between the Company and
Buyer prior to the  Effective Time) during the period commencing at the

or section of the Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of the
information disclosed therein to the Person to which such disclosure is being
made. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall not be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this

unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
