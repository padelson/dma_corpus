SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpretation.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language in this Agreement is to be construed in all cases according to
its fair meaning. Ecolab and Nalco acknowledge and agree that each Party and its counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities
are to be resolved against the drafting Party or the Party in favor of which a clause has been drafted or in favor of the Party who has committed itself in a clause, is not to be employed in the
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever used herein, the words "include," "includes" and "including" mean "include, without limitation," "includes, without limitation" and "including, without
limitation," respectively. The masculine, feminine or neuter gender and the singular or plural number are each deemed to include the other whenever the context so indicates. The use of "or" is not
intended to be exclusive unless expressly indicated otherwise. The word "days" means calendar days unless otherwise specified. Time periods within or following which any payment is to be made or act
is to be done will, unless expressly indicated otherwise, be calculated by excluding the day on which the period commences and including the day on which the period ends and by extending the period to
the next Business Day following if the last day of the period is not a Business Day. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this
Agreement as a whole (including any Exhibits, Schedules and the Parties' disclosure letters) and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and all Article, Section, Exhibit and Schedule
references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Where this Agreement states that a Party "will" or "must" perform in some manner or otherwise act or omit to act, it means that the Party
is legally obligated to do so in accordance with this Agreement. Any reference to a statute, rule or regulation is deemed also to refer to any amendments or successor legislation as in effect at the
relevant time. Any
reference to a Contract or other document as of a given date means the Contract or other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time through such date. When a sentence includes
the words "would reasonably be expected to have" or "would not reasonably be expected to have" in reference to the occurrence or non-occurrence of a "Material Adverse Effect," the words
"would reasonably be expected to have" will be read out of the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" for purposes of such sentence to avoid duplication. </FONT></P>

fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and provide advancement of
expenses to, all past and present directors and officers of Nalco and the Nalco Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Indemnified Persons</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>")
(A)&nbsp;to the same extent such Indemnified Persons are indemnified or exculpated or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Nalco pursuant to Nalco's
Constituent Documents and indemnification Contracts, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with the Indemnified Persons and (B)&nbsp;without limitation to clause&nbsp;(A), to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, (ii)&nbsp;honor the provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of directors and officers and advancement of expenses contained in
Nalco's Constituent Documents immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii)&nbsp;maintain for a period of six years after the Effective Time policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>D&nbsp;&amp; O Insurance</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") covering each person covered by Nalco's current D&nbsp;&amp; O Insurance as of the
Effective Time, providing for at least the same coverage and amounts as, and containing terms and conditions which are no less favorable to the insured than, such current D&nbsp;&amp; O Insurance, with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for any one coverage year more than 250&nbsp;percent of the current annual premium expended
by Nalco and the Nalco Subsidiaries to maintain or procure such D&nbsp;&amp; O Insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amount, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Maximum Annual
Premium</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. In lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Ecolab may direct Nalco or the Surviving Corporation to purchase "tail" insurance
coverage, at a cost no greater than the six times the Maximum Annual Premium, that provides coverage not less favorable than the coverage described above. </FONT></P>
