 _Section 1.3 Interpretation._ The language in this Agreement is to be construed in all cases according to its fair meaning. Ecolab and Nalco acknowledge and agree that each Party and its counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting Party or the Party in favor of which a clause has been drafted or in favor of the Party who has committed itself in a clause, is not to be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever used herein, the words "include," "includes" and "including" mean "include, without limitation," "includes, without limitation" and "including, without limitation," respectively. The masculine, feminine or neuter gender and the singular or plural number are each deemed to include the other whenever the context so indicates. The use of "or" is not intended to be exclusive unless expressly indicated otherwise. The word "days" means calendar days unless otherwise specified. Time periods within or following which any payment is to be made or act is to be done will, unless expressly indicated otherwise, be calculated by excluding the day on which the period commences and including the day on which the period ends and by extending the period to the next Business Day following if the last day of the period is not a Business Day. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any Exhibits, Schedules and the Parties\' disclosure letters) and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and all Article, Section, Exhibit and Schedule references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Where this Agreement states that a Party "will" or "must" perform in some manner or otherwise act or omit to act, it means that the Party is legally obligated to do so in accordance with this Agreement. Any reference to a statute, rule or regulation is deemed also to refer to any amendments or successor legislation as in effect at the relevant time. Any reference to a Contract or other document as of a given date means the Contract or other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time through such date. When a sentence includes the words "would reasonably be expected to have" or "would not reasonably be expected to have" in reference to the occurrence or non-occurrence of a "Material Adverse Effect," the words "would reasonably be expected to have" will be read out of the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" for purposes of such sentence to avoid duplication.

 (a) Each share of Nalco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into and will 

  

      

  

thereafter represent the right to receive the following consideration, as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.8_ (in the aggregate for all shares of Nalco

 (b) Each share of Nalco Common Stock owned by Ecolab or the Nalco or their respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (" _Excluded Shares_ "), in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be canceled without any conversion thereof, and no Merger Consideration will be paid with respect thereto.

If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of shares for which no election to receive cash or stock has been made, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 2.7(c)_, if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholder\'s Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will cease. Nalco will give Ecolab (i) prompt notice of any written demands received by the Nalco for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of 

  

      

  
  

such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL which are
received by the Nalco relating to such holder\'s rights of appraisal, and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Nalco will not, except with the prior
written consent of Ecolab, make any payment with respect to any demand
for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands, and Ecolab will
not commit to make any such payment or enter into any such settlement prior to
the Effective Time without the prior written consent of Nalco.

  

 (d) Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain issued and outstanding from and after the Effective Time as the common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) If after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, (i) Nalco pays a dividend in, splits, combines into a smaller number of shares, or issues by reclassification any shares of Nalco Common Stock (or undertakes any similar act) or (ii) Ecolab pays a dividend in, splits, combines into a smaller number of shares, or issues by reclassification any shares of Ecolab Common Stock (or undertakes any similar act), then the Merger Consideration, the Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of the Nalco Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as so adjusted will, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, the Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration, the Exchange Ratio or other dependent item, as applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this provision. 

  

 (f) From and after the Effective Time, the Nalco Common Stock converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ will no longer remain outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any such Nalco Common Stock or shares of Nalco Common Stock that are in non-certificated book-entry form (either case being referred to in this Agreement, to the extent applicable, as a " _Certificate_ ") will thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Nalco Common Stock except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with _Section 3.1(g)_ and (iii) any dividends or other distributions as provided in _Section 3.1(e)_. 

  

 (g) This Agreement is intended to meet the requirements of Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(2) in accordance and compliance with IRS Notice 2010-25, 2010-14 I.R.B. 527. 

  

  

 _Section 2.8 Proration._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary: 

  

  

 (a) If the product of the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares and the Cash Consideration (such product being the " _Elected Cash Consideration_ ") exceeds the Available Cash Amount, then: 

    

 (i) all Stock Election Shares and all No Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and 

  

 (ii) a portion of the Cash Election Shares of each holder of Nalco Common Stock (if any) will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, with such portion being equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of such holder\'s Cash Election Shares by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Available Cash Amount and the denominator of which will be the Elected Cash Consideration, with the remaining portion of such holder\'s Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. 

   

      

  

 (b) If the Elected Cash Consideration is less than the Available Cash Amount (such difference being the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then: 

    

 (i) all Cash Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and 

  

 (ii) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares will be treated in the following manner: (A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the product of the aggregate number of No Election Shares and $38.80 (the " _No Election Value_ "), then (1) all Stock Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and (2) the No Election Shares of each holder of Nalco Common Stock (if any) will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of No Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of No Election Shares of such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the No Election Value, with the remaining portion of such holder\'s No Election Shares (if any) being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration or (B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the No Election Value, then (1) all No Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and (2) a portion of the Stock Election Shares of each holder of Nalco Common Stock (if any) will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, with such portion being equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares of such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the No Election Value, and the denominator of which is the product obtained by multiplying the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares by $38.80, with the remaining portion of such holder\'s Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. 

    

 (c) If the Elected Cash Consideration equals the Available Cash Amount, then: 

    

 (i) all Cash Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and 

  

 (ii) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. 

   

  

 _Section 2.9 Elections_. 

  

  

 (a) Within two Business Days after the Closing Date (the " _Mailing Date_ "), an election form in such form as Ecolab will have specified prior to the Closing Date and which is reasonably acceptable to Nalco (the " _Election Form_ ") will be mailed to each holder of record of shares of Nalco Common Stock as of the Closing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_ "). 

  

 (b) Each Election Form will permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through customary documentation and instructions) to specify (i) the number of shares of such holder\'s Nalco Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Stock Consideration, (ii) the number of shares of such holder\'s Nalco Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Cash Consideration or (iii) that such holder makes no election with respect to such holder\'s Nalco Common Stock. In addition, if such holder holds multiple blocks of Nalco Common Stock, the Election Form will permit such holder to designate (i) the shares with respect to which each election is made, (ii) if the same election is made with respect to shares in more than one block, the order of priority of shares to which the election is to be effective in the event of proration, or (iii) if no election is made, the order of priority of shares to be exchanged for cash. Any Nalco Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent does not receive a properly completed Election Form during the period (the " _Election Period_ ") from the Mailing Date to 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the 20th Business Day after the Mailing Date or such other date 

  

      

  
  

as Ecolab and Nalco will, prior to the Closing, mutually agree (the "
_Election Deadline_ ") will be deemed not to have made any election with
respect to such holder\'s Nalco Common Stock. Ecolab will publicly announce
the anticipated Election Deadline as soon as practicable.

  

 (c) Any election made pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ will have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent will have actually received a properly completed Election Form during the Election Period. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting it, by written notice received by the Exchange Agent during the Election Period. In the event an Election Form is revoked during the Election Period, the shares of Nalco Common Stock represented by such Election Form will be deemed to be shares in respect of which no election has been made, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made during the Election Period. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent will have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters will be binding and conclusive. None of Ecolab or Nalco or the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form. 

  

  

 _Section 2.10 Treatment of Nalco Equity-Based Awards_. 

  

  

 (a) Each Equity Right that is an option to purchase shares of Nalco Common Stock (a " _Nalco Stock Option_ ") granted under the Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan or any other equity or equity-based compensation plan of Nalco (each, a " _Nalco Stock Plan_ ") or pursuant to any individual equity compensation award agreement, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease, at the Effective Time, to represent a right to acquire shares of Nalco Common Stock and will be converted at the Effective Time, without any action on the part of the holder of such Nalco Stock Option, into an option to purchase Ecolab Common Stock (a " _Converted Stock Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Nalco Stock Option (but subject to and taking into account any required acceleration of vesting of such Nalco Stock Option pursuant to any applicable Contract in effect as of the date of this Agreement). The number of shares of Ecolab Common Stock subject to each such Converted Stock Option will be equal to the number of shares of Nalco Common Stock subject to the applicable Nalco Stock Option multiplied by the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of Ecolab Common Stock, and such Converted Stock Option will have an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the per share exercise price specified in the applicable Nalco Stock Option divided by the Stock Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that in the case of any Nalco Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the Effective Time (after taking into account the effect of any accelerated vesting thereof, if applicable) by reason of its qualification under Section 422 or Section 423 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of shares of Ecolab Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option will be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the case of any Nalco Stock Option to which Section 409A of the Code applies as of the Effective Time, the exercise price, the number of shares of Ecolab Common Stock subject to such Nalco Stock Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Nalco Stock Option will be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and (ii) in the case of any other Nalco Stock Option, the conversion of such Nalco Stock Option will comply in all material respects with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D). 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, each Equity Right consisting of, based on or relating to shares of Nalco Common Stock granted under a Nalco Stock Plan or pursuant to any individual equity 

  

      

  
  

compensation award agreement, other than Nalco Stock Options (each, a "
_Nalco Stock-Based Award_ "), whether contingent or accrued, which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease, at the
Effective Time, to represent an Equity Right with respect to shares of Nalco
Common Stock and will be converted without any action on the part of the
holder of such Equity Right, at the Effective Time, into an Equity Right
consisting of, based on or relating to shares of Ecolab Common Stock (each, a
" _Converted Stock-Based Award_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Nalco Stock-Based Awards (but subject to and taking into
account any required acceleration of vesting of such Nalco Stock-Based Award
pursuant to any applicable Contract in effect as of the date of this
Agreement); _provided_ that any Nalco Stock-Based Award that is also a Nalco
RSU will, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) become fully vested
without any action on the part of any holder thereof and (ii) be settled in
shares of Nalco Common Stock which will be converted into the right to
receive, at the election of each holder thereof, the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article II_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, any Merger Consideration payable to non-U.S. holders of
Nalco RSUs pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid reasonably promptly
following the earliest time necessary to comply with applicable Law, and may
be paid in such manner and kind as determined by Ecolab to be necessary to
comply with applicable Law. The number of shares of Ecolab Common Stock
subject to each such Converted Stock-Based Award will be equal to the number
of shares of Nalco Common Stock subject to the applicable Nalco Stock-Based
Award multiplied by the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest
whole share of Ecolab Common Stock. Any dividend equivalents credited to
the account of the holder of each Nalco Stock-Based Award as of the Effective
Time will remain credited to such holder\'s account (with respect to dividend
equivalents denominated in shares of Nalco Common Stock) immediately
following the Effective Time, subject to adjustment in accordance with the
foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversion of Nalco Stock-Based
Awards and the vesting and settlement of Nalco RSUs will (i) in the case of
any Nalco Stock-Based Award or Nalco RSU that constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A immediately prior to the
Effective Time, comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of Code Section 409A and (ii) in the case of any other Nalco
Stock-Based Award or Nalco RSU, comply in all material respects with the
requirements of any applicable exemption from Code Section 409A in order to
remain so exempt.

  

 (c) With respect to any Nalco Stock Options or Nalco Stock-Based Awards that are subject to vesting or other provisions that are wholly or partially dependent on the achievement of performance goals or objectives, subject to any contractual obligations of Nalco and the Nalco Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement, Ecolab and Nalco will agree prior to the Effective Time on any adjustments or other actions reasonably required to maintain such Nalco Stock Options or Nalco Stock-Based Awards following the Effective Time as Converted Stock Options or Converted Stock-Based Awards subject to substantially equivalent terms and conditions (including substantially equivalent performance goals and objectives). The Board of Directors of Nalco, or an appropriate committee thereof, will prior to the Effective Time take any actions required to give effect to the agreement of the Parties with respect to such Nalco Stock Options and Nalco Stock-Based Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustment or other action taken with respect to Nalco Stock Options or Nalco Stock-Based Awards that are subject to vesting or other provisions that are wholly or partially dependent on the achievement of performance goals or objectives will (i) in the case of any such Nalco Stock Option or Nalco Stock-Based Award that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A immediately prior to the Effective Time, comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of Code Section 409A and (ii) in the case of any other Nalco Stock Options or Nalco Stock-Based Awards, comply in all material respects with the requirements of any applicable exemption from Code Section 409A in order to remain so exempt. 

  

      

                                    

  

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, Ecolab will assume all the obligations of Nalco under the Nalco Stock Plans, each outstanding Converted Stock Option and Converted Stock-Based Award and any agreements evidencing the grants thereof. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Ecolab will deliver to the holders of Converted Stock Options and Converted Stock-Based Awards any required notices setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to the relevant Nalco Stock Plans and award documents and stating that such Converted Stock Options and Converted Stock-Based Awards have been assumed by Ecolab and will continue in effect on the same terms and conditions, subject to the adjustments required by this _Section 2.10_ after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the relevant Nalco Stock Plans or individual agreements pursuant to which such awards were granted. 

  

 (e) Following the Effective Time, Ecolab may in its discretion maintain the Nalco Stock Plans in accordance with NYSE rules, except that (i) all Equity Rights issued by Ecolab pursuant to the Nalco Stock Plans following the Effective Time will be Equity Rights in respect of Ecolab Common Stock, (ii) all references to Nalco (other than any references relating to a "change in control," "change of control" or term of similar import of Nalco) in each Nalco Stock Plan and in each Contract evidencing any award thereunder will be deemed to refer to Ecolab, unless Ecolab determines otherwise, and (iii) the number of shares of Ecolab Common Stock available for future issuance pursuant to each Nalco Stock Plan following the Effective Time (the " _Available Nalco Stock Plan Shares_ ") will be equal to the number of shares of Nalco Common Stock so available immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share of Ecolab Common Stock. 

  

 (f) Prior to the Effective Time, Nalco will take all necessary action for the adjustment of Nalco Stock Options and Nalco Stock-Based Awards under this _Section 2.10_. Prior to the Effective Time, Ecolab will reserve for future issuance a number of shares of Ecolab Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Ecolab Common Stock that will be subject to Converted Stock Options and Converted Stock-Based Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by this _Section 2.10_, plus the number of Available Nalco Stock Plan Shares in the event that Ecolab maintains the Nalco Stock Plans as contemplated by  _Section 2.10(e)_. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Ecolab will file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to the shares of Ecolab Common Stock subject to such Converted Stock Options and Converted Stock-Based Awards and will maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Converted Stock Options and Converted Stock-Based Awards remain outstanding. 

  

 

ARTICLE III 
 EXCHANGE OF SHARES

  

 _Section 3.1 Surrender and Payment_. 

  

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Ecolab will appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Nalco (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than two Business Days following the Effective Time, Ecolab will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Nalco Common Stock as of the Effective Time, whose shares of Nalco Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal (which will specify that the delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent) in such form as Nalco and Ecolab may reasonably agree, including instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

  

      

  

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Ecolab will cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Nalco Common Stock, shares of Ecolab Common Stock and an amount of cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to be issued and paid pursuant to _Section 2.7_ and _Section 2.8_, payable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. Following the Effective Time, Ecolab will make available to the Exchange Agent, when and as needed, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.1(g)_. All cash and book-entry shares representing shares of Ecolab Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent are referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the appropriate Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent will invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Ecolab; _provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon will affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of shares of Nalco Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests and Ecolab will promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of Nalco Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be the property of, and paid to, Ecolab. 

  

 (c) Each holder of shares of Nalco Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the number of shares of Ecolab Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Ecolab Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive and/or (ii) a check in the amount, if any, that such holder has the right to receive in cash, including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares and dividends and other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(g)_, pursuant to _Section 2.7_, _Section 2.8_, _Article II_ and this _Article III_. Following the Election Deadline, the Merger Consideration will be paid as promptly as practicable (by mail or, to the extent commercially practicable, made available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder of a Certificate) after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. 

  

 (d) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment will pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or will establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration will pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (e) After the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers of shares of Nalco Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing 

  

      

  
  

shares of Nalco Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Nalco Common
Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent
or Ecolab, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided
for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article II_ and
this _Article III_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation is obligated to pay any dividends or
make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
which may have been declared or made by Nalco on shares of Nalco Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the date hereof and
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

  

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Nalco Common Stock one year after the Effective Time will be returned to Ecolab, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his or her shares of Nalco Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_ prior to that time will thereafter look only to Ecolab for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder\'s shares of Nalco Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Ecolab, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Nalco will be liable to any holder of shares of Nalco Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Nalco Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the property of Ecolab free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Ecolab Common Stock issued in the Merger will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as provided in this _Section 3.1_. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, there will be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Ecolab Common Stock, if any, issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such shares of Ecolab Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Ecolab Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Ecolab Common Stock, all shares of Ecolab Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger will be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. 

  

  

 _Section 3.2 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Ecolab, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Ecolab may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Nalco Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by _Article II _and this _Article III_. 

  

 _Section 3.3 Withholding Rights._ Ecolab, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Nalco Common Stock pursuant to the Merger such amounts as Ecolab, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so 

        
  

deducted or withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority
or Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of
Nalco Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

   

 _Section 3.4 Further Assurances._ After the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Nalco, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Nalco, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

  

ARTICLE IV 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF NALCO

  

 Except as otherwise disclosed or identified in the Nalco SEC Documents filed and publicly available on the internet website of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") at least two Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding any risk factor disclosure and disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or other statements included in such Nalco SEC Documents that are predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in the letter (the " _Nalco Disclosure Letter_ ") delivered to Ecolab by Nalco prior to the execution of this Agreement (it being understood that any information contained therein will qualify and apply to the representations and warranties in this _Article IV_ to which the information is specifically stated as referring to and will qualify and apply to other representations and warranties in this _Article IV_ to the extent, and only to the extent, that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies or is applicable to such other sections), Nalco represents and warrants to Ecolab and Merger Sub as follows:

Nalco has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where failure to have such power or authority, individually or on the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Nalco Material Adverse Effect.

 (b) Nalco is, directly or indirectly, the record holder and Beneficial Owner of all of the outstanding Securities of each Nalco Subsidiary, free and clear of any Liens and free of any other limitation or restriction, including any limitation or restriction on the right to vote, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Securities. All of the Securities so owned by Nalco have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and no such shares have been issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights. Except for the Securities of the Nalco

contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible after the date of this
Agreement.

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 7.4(d)_ or anything else in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to require Ecolab or Nalco or any of their respective Subsidiaries to agree to or take any action that would result in any Burdensome Condition. 

  

  

 _Section 7.5 No Solicitation by Nalco_. 

  

  

 (a) Nalco will (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person or its Representatives (other than Ecolab and Merger Sub and their Representatives) conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Nalco Acquisition Proposal and will request the prompt return of any confidential information previously furnished to such Persons in connection therewith and (ii) promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries\' respective Representatives of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.5_.

 (c) Notwithstanding  _Section 7.5(b)_ or anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Nalco Stockholder Approval, Nalco may, in response to a _bona fide_ written Nalco Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.5_, furnish information and data to the Person making such Nalco Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to and in accordance with a written confidentiality agreement, containing provisions relating to confidentiality that are no less restrictive in the aggregate than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain "standstill" provisions), and participate and engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or its Representatives regarding such Nalco Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , in each case, that the Board of Directors of Nalco has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Nalco Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Nalco Proposal and that the failure to furnish such information or 

  

      

  
  

participate in such discussions or negotiations would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Nalco under applicable Law. No
confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this _Section 7.5(c)_ may
contain any provision that would prevent Nalco from complying with its
obligation to provide any disclosure to Ecolab required pursuant to _Section

Nalco agrees that, during the applicable period prior to its effecting a Nalco Change in Recommendation, Nalco and its Representatives will negotiate in good faith with Ecolab and its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Ecolab. If, following the execution by the Parties of an amendment to this Agreement providing for revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that obviate the need for a Nalco Change in Recommendation in connection with a Superior Nalco Proposal, such Superior Nalco Proposal is revised (on one or more occasions), or Nalco receives a Superior Nalco Proposal from another Person, then the provisions of this _Section 7.5(e)_ will be applicable with respect to each Nalco Change in Recommendation relating to any such amended or additional Superior Nalco Proposal.

respect to any change to price or other material terms of such Nalco
Acquisition Proposal. Nalco will, promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof,
provide Ecolab (or its outside counsel) with copies of all drafts and final

Acquisition Proposal) relating to such Nalco Acquisition Proposal exchanged
between Nalco or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person
making such Nalco Acquisition Proposal or any of its Representatives, on the
other hand.

  

 (h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in _Section 7.5_ or _Section 7.2_ will prohibit Nalco from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act in respect of any Nalco Acquisition Proposal or making any disclosure to the stockholders of Nalco if the Board of Directors of Nalco determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with applicable Law or its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Nalco; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of Nalco will not, except as expressly permitted by _Section 7.5(d)_, effect a Nalco Change in Recommendation.

or participate in such discussions or negotiations would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Ecolab under applicable Law. No
confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this _Section 7.6(c)_ may
contain any provision that would prevent Ecolab from complying with its
obligation to provide any disclosure to Nalco required pursuant to _Section

Ecolab agrees that, during the applicable period prior to its effecting an Ecolab Change in Recommendation, Ecolab and its Representatives will negotiate in good faith with Nalco and its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Nalco. If, following the execution by the Parties of an amendment to this Agreement providing for revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that obviate the need for an Ecolab Change in Recommendation in connection with a Superior Ecolab Proposal, such Superior Ecolab Proposal is revised (on one or more occasions), or Ecolab receives a Superior Ecolab Proposal from another Person, then the provisions of this _Section 7.6(e)_ will be applicable with respect to each Ecolab Change in Recommendation relating to any such amended or additional Superior Ecolab Proposal.

 _Section 7.7 Employee Matters._

 (c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates will use their reasonable best efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the corresponding welfare plans maintained by Nalco or its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co payments and deductibles paid by such Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out of pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan. 

  

 (d) This Agreement is not intended by the Parties to (i) constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan, fund or program, (ii) obligate Ecolab, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to maintain any particular compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement or (iii) create any obligation of the Parties with respect to any employee benefit plan of Ecolab, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing contained in this 

  

      

  

Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any employee any
benefits under any employee benefit plan, fund or program, including severance
benefits or the right to employment or continued employment with Ecolab, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates for any period by reason of
this Agreement.

  

 (e) Reasonably promptly after the date hereof, Nalco will deliver to Ecolab a worksheet or memorandum demonstrating the extent (if any) to which payments or benefits to be paid or provided to Section 16 Officers in connection with the Merger (under this Agreement or any other Contract, plan or arrangement with Nalco or otherwise) could constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. 

  

  

 _Section 7.8 Fees and Expenses._ Subject to _Section 9.3_, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by the Party incurring such Expenses.

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (i) indemnify and hold harmless, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors and officers of Nalco and the Nalco Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") (A) to the same extent such Indemnified Persons are indemnified or exculpated or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Nalco pursuant to Nalco\'s Constituent Documents and indemnification Contracts, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with the Indemnified Persons and (B) without limitation to clause (A), to the fullest extent permitted by Law, (ii) honor the provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of directors and officers and advancement of expenses contained in Nalco\'s Constituent Documents immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) maintain for a period of six years after the Effective Time policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (" _D and O Insurance_") covering each person covered by Nalco\'s current D and O Insurance as of the Effective Time, providing for at least the same coverage and amounts as, and containing terms and conditions which are no less favorable to the insured than, such current D and O Insurance, with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for any one coverage year more than 250 percent of the current annual premium expended by Nalco and the Nalco Subsidiaries to maintain or procure such D and O Insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. In lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Ecolab may direct Nalco or the Surviving Corporation to purchase "tail" insurance coverage, at a cost no greater than the six times the Maximum Annual Premium, that provides coverage not less favorable than the coverage described above. 

  

 (b) The rights of each Indemnified Person hereunder will be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the Constituent Documents of Nalco or any of the Nalco Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification Contract, the DGCL or otherwise. 

  

      

                                    

  

  

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ will survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and his or her heirs. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will assume and comply with the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.9_. 

   

 (d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.9_ will not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person, it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons will be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.9_. Ecolab will honor, guaranty and stand as a surety for, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and successors to honor and comply with, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section 7.9_ without limit as to time. Ecolab will pay all reasonable expenses that may be incurred by an Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 7.9_.

 _Section 7.14 State Takeover Laws._ If any "fair price," "business combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Nalco and its Board of Directors will use their reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and will otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 _Section 7.18 Reorganization Treatment._ The Parties intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and each will not, and will not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action, or fail to take any action, that would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Provided that the opinion conditions contained in _Section 8.2(d) _ and _Section 8.3(c)_ have been satisfied, Ecolab will file the opinions described in _Section 8.2(d)_ and _Section 8.3(c)_ with the SEC by a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 promptly following the Closing.

 _Section 10.3 Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement will become effective when each Party has received counterparts signed and delivered (by facsimile or otherwise) by the other Parties. 

   

 _Section 10.4 Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement (including the Exhibits, Schedules and the Parties\' disclosure letters) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to their subject matter. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any Person not a party to this Agreement any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever, other than (a) _Section 7.9_, which is intended to be for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons and their heirs and assigns covered thereby and may be enforced by such Indemnified Persons and their heirs and assigns and (b) _Article II_, which is intended to be for the benefit of holders of shares of Nalco Common Stock, Nalco Stock Options and Nalco Stock-Based Awards with respect to the right of such holders to receive, as applicable, the Merger Consideration, Converted Stock Options or Converted Stock-Based Awards. 

  

 _Section 10.5 Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 _Section 10.6 Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the Parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent will be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 _Section 10.7 Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters 

        
  

presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Nalco or the
stockholders of Ecolab, but after such approval, no amendment will be made
which by Law or in accordance with the rules of the NYSE requires further
approval by such stockholders without such further approval. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, no amendment will be made to this Agreement after the
Effective Time. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

  

 _Section 10.8 Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may to the extent legally permitted (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver will be made which by Law or in accordance with the rules of the NYSE requires further approval by the stockholders of Nalco or the stockholders of Ecolab without such further approval. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

  

 _Section 10.9 Governing Law and Venue: Waiver of Jury Trial_. 

  

  

 (a) THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS WILL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. The Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware with respect to all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement, and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding will be heard and determined exclusively in such a Delaware state or federal court. The Parties consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such Parties solely for such purpose and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 10.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law will be valid and sufficient service. 

  

 (b) EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER. EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER. EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS IN THIS _SECTION 10.9(b)_. 

  

       

 _Section 10.10 Enforcement._ The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Except as provided in _Section 9.2_, it is accordingly agreed that the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any court referred to in _Section 10.9_, without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for such breach.
