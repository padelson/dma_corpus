and inspection shall be at Buyers sole risk, cost and expense and Buyer
waives and releases all claims against Seller and its partners and members and
their Affiliates and the respective employees, officers, employees, attorneys,
contractors and agents of such parties (collectively the "Inspection
Indemnitees") arising in any way therefrom or in any way related thereto or
arising in connection with the conduct of the Inspection Indemnitees and (b)
Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Inspection Indemnitees
from any and all claims, actions, causes of action liabilities, losses,
damages, fines, penalties, costs or expenses (including, without limitation,
court costs, consultants and attorneys fees) of any kind or
character (collectively, "Damages"), or Liens for labor or materials, arising
out of or in any way connected with such matters. THE FOREGOING RELEASE AND
INDEMNIFICATION SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF
ACTION, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (i)
NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXCLUDING THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE
OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF SELLER OR (ii) STRICT LIABILITY.

Section 8.7. _Confidentiality Agreement_. The Confidentiality Agreement,
except to the extent modified herein, will remain in full force and effect;
provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of Section 8.12, upon
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate, and Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, not make disclosure to third parties of any
confidential or proprietary information relating to a Company or the
Properties, except with the prior consent of Buyer or as required by
Applicable Law; provided, further, that nothing shall prohibit Seller or its
Affiliates from using their knowledge or mental impressions of
such information or their general knowledge of the industry or geographic
area in the conduct of their respective businesses following Closing. At
Closing, and to the extent assignable, Seller will, or will cause its
Affiliates to, assign to Buyer the benefits under any and all confidentiality
agreements between Seller, or any of its Affiliates, and any third party in
connection with the potential sale or other disposition by Seller and its
Affiliates of the Companies or the Properties. 

 



39 Section 8.8. _Officer and Director Resignation and Releases_. At the Closing,
each Company shall deliver to Buyer (a) resignations of the respective
managers, directors and officers of such Company in the form and substance
attached hereto as Exhibit 8.8(a), such resignations to be effective
immediately upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) subject to the provisions of Section 8.9, releases from all
such individuals, releasing such Company, Seller and their Affiliates from any
and all claims of such individuals against them, substantially in the form
and substance attached hereto as Exhibit 8.8(b).

 

Section 8.9. _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

 

(a) Neither Buyer nor any Company shall amend, repeal or otherwise modify the
Governing Documents of a Company so as to affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who at and any time prior to the Closing Date were
directors, officers, managers or agents of such Company to indemnification or
exculpation. Buyer shall, and shall cause each Company to, honor any
indemnification agreements between such Company and any of its directors,
officers, managers or agents. In the event any claim or claims are asserted or
made pursuant to the indemnification rights set forth in this Section 8.9,
all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until the disposition of any and all such claims. Any determination
required to be made with respect to whether a persons conduct complies with
the applicable standard of conduct shall be made by independent legal counsel
selected by any such director, officer, manager or other agent and reasonably
acceptable to Buyer.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, each Company will purchase a six (6) year directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance covering
the directors and officers of such Company who are currently covered by such
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance or fiduciary
liability insurance policies and Buyer will take no action which would
interfere with the benefit of such policy during such term.

 

Section 8.10. _Employee Matters_. At least five (5) days before the Closing
Date, Buyer shall issue, or shall cause its Affiliate to issue, written
offers of employment to all Employees whose primary duties involve maintaining
or providing services to the Properties in the field ("Field Employees")
subject to each Field Employee passing the standard pre-employment background
check and drug-screening procedure of Buyer or its Affiliate. The list of
Field Employees is set forth on Section 8.10 of the Disclosure Schedule. Buyer
or its Affiliate shall also be permitted to make written offers of employment
to Employees who are not designated on Section 8.10 of the Disclosure Schedule
as Field Employees only with prior written permission from Seller. All
employment offers issued by Buyer or its Affiliate under this Section 8.10
shall be conditioned on the Closing and effective from and after the Closing
Date and shall provide for the same regular salary or hourly rate, as
applicable, as each Employee had with Seller immediately before the
Closing Date for at least one year following the Closing Date, plus
substantially similar other terms and conditions of employment (including
without limitation position, title, duties, responsibilities, insurance and
other employee benefits, bonus opportunity, incentive opportunity, vacation,
sick, or other paid leave) as Buyer and its Affiliates provide to similarly
situated employees. Buyer shall notify Seller in writing and Buyer and Seller
shall 

 



40  confer at least two (2) days before the Closing Date as to the identities of
such Employees who have accepted Buyers offers of employment (the "Hired
Employees"). Seller will accept the resignation or terminate the employment
of the Hired Employees effective as of the date immediately before the Closing
Date. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause each Hired Employee to
receive full credit for such Employees service with Seller and any
predecessor for purposes of eligibility, benefit level and accrual (but not
for purposes of benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans), and
vesting under any benefit plans made available to employees of Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer that employs the Hired Employees in which a Hired Employee
participates to the same extent recognized by Seller or Insperity immediately
prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits with respect to the same period of service. On and after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall or shall cause any Affiliate that employs the
Hired Employees to make reasonable efforts to (A) waive any preexisting
condition limitations otherwise applicable to Hired Employees and their
eligible dependents under any plan of Buyer or its Affiliate that provides
health benefits in which Hired Employees may be eligible to participate on
and after the Closing and (B) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence
of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Hired
Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing Date, in
each case to the extent such Hired Employee or eligible dependent had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous employee
plan of Seller or Insperity immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided,
however, that with respect to any insured plan the obligations of Buyer or its
Affiliate hereunder shall be limited to (i) requesting in good faith that the
applicable insurer implement such actions, and (ii) incurring any reasonable
administrative costs related thereto, if necessary. The provisions of this
Section 8.10 are intended to benefit the parties to this Agreement and the
Affiliate(s) of each Company referenced in this Section 8.10 and nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any other Person (including for the avoidance of doubt
any Employees) other than the parties to this Agreement, the Affiliate(s) of
each Company referenced in this Section 8.10, and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.11. _Taxes_.

(a) Buyer and Seller agree to treat the purchase and sale of the membership
interests of CGT for federal income Tax purposes as a purchase and sale of all
of the assets of CGT.

 

(b) Buyer and Seller agree to allocate the Base Purchase Price, as adjusted
hereunder, among the membership interests of CGT, the common membership
interests of CAM, the CAI Note and the CAI Stock. Buyer and Seller agree to
further allocate the amounts allocated to the membership interests of CGT and
the common membership interests of CAM among the assets of CGT and CAM. At
least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer an allocation of the Base Purchase Price among the assets of
CGT and CAM, the CAI Note and the CAI Stock in a manner consistent
with Section 1060 of the Code (the "Purchase Price Allocation") based upon
the fair market values of such assets. (For these purposes, Seller and Buyer
agree that the fair market value of the CAI Note, and the portion of the
Base Purchase Price to be

 



41  allocated to such note, is equal to the total amount due thereunder as of
the Closing Date, including principal and accrued interest thereon.) Seller
and Buyer shall thereafter use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon
the Purchase Price Allocation on or before the Closing Date. Buyer and Seller
anticipate that, in general, the amounts allocated to the Pipeline,
Facilities, Permits, Easements and Fee Interests will (because those items
were recently purchased or constructed) be equal to the original cost of such
Properties.

(c) If an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price is made under this Agreement,
the parties shall adjust the Purchase Price Allocation to be consistent with
the Purchase Price. Seller and Buyer shall report the transactions
contemplated hereby on all Tax Returns (including Form 8594 and all other
information returns and supplements thereto required to be filed by the
parties under Section 1060 of the Code) in a manner consistent with such
Purchase Price Allocation.

 

(d) If, notwithstanding Section 8.11(b), Seller and Buyer do not agree on the
Purchase Price Allocation prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall promptly
engage a firm experienced in such matters and reasonably acceptable to Buyer,
to conduct an appraisal and determine the fair market value of the assets of
CGT and CAM and of the CAI Stock (it being assumed for such purposes that the
fair market value of the CAI Note is the amount specified in Section 8.11(b)).
The cost of such appraisal shall be borne one-half by Seller and one-half by
Buyer. Seller and Buyer agree to allocate the Purchase Price among the assets
of CGT and CAM and the CAI Stock and to report the transactions contemplated
hereby on all Tax Returns (including Form 8594 and all other information
returns and supplements thereto required to be filed by the parties
under Section 1060 of the Code) in a manner consistent with the values
determined by such appraisal (and of the agreed value of the CAI Note).

(e) Neither Seller nor Buyer shall take, or shall permit any of their
respective Affiliates to take, any position inconsistent with the allocation
under this Section 8.11 on any Tax Return or otherwise, unless required to do
so by Applicable Laws or a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a)(1) of the Code or a similar provisions of state, local or foreign
Applicable Law respecting Tax.

 

(f) Seller will cause to be prepared and filed (i) all federal and state
income Tax Returns for CAM and Centrahoma JV that are required to be filed
for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, including but not
limited to the final federal income Tax Returns of CAM and Centrahoma JV on
IRS Form 1065 for the Tax period that ends on the Closing Date, and (ii) all
other Tax Returns for the Companies and Centrahoma JV that are required to be
filed on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid
all Taxes reported to be due on such Tax Returns (subject to reimbursement
by Buyer if required by Section 8.11(h)); provided, however, that with
respect to any Tax Return of Centrahoma JV, Seller shall be responsible only
for Taxes attributable to the CAM Centrahoma JV Interest. Buyer and Seller
acknowledge and agree that the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
will cause a termination of CAM and Centrahoma JV for federal income Tax
purposes under Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code, and that the respective
taxable years of CAM and Centrahoma JV will end on the Closing Date. Buyer
will cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns for the

 



42  Companies and Centrahoma JV that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns (subject to reimbursement by Seller if required by Section 8.11(h)).

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of Tax with respect to the
income, property or operations of the Company that is attributable to any Tax
period that begins on or before the Effective Time and ends after the
Effective Time (a "Straddle Period") will be apportioned between the period
of the Straddle Period from before the Effective Time through the Effective
Time (the "Pre-Effective Time Straddle Period") and the period of the Straddle
Period that extends after the Effective Time to the end of the Straddle
Period (the "Post-Effective Time Straddle Period") in accordance with this
Section 8.11(g). The portion of such Tax attributable to the Pre-Effective
Time Straddle Period will (i) in the case of any Taxes other than sales or
use taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax
based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle
Period, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Pre-Effective Time Straddle Period and denominator of which is the number of
days in the Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any sales or use
taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax
based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle
Period, be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Straddle
Period ended on and included the Effective Time. The portion of Tax
attributable to a Post-Effective Time Straddle Period shall be calculated in a
corresponding manner.

(h) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that Tax Returns relating to a Straddle
Period may be required to be filed by either Buyer or Seller under Section
8.11(f), and thus the Tax thereon may be initially paid by either Buyer or
Seller. If any such Tax is initially paid by Seller, and Seller gives written
notice to Buyer that includes a copy of the Tax Return for the Straddle Period
and provides reasonable detail concerning the calculation of the portions of
Tax attributable to the Post-Effective Time Straddle Period, within 30 days
Buyer shall pay Seller the portion properly attributable to such Post-
Effective Time Straddle Period. Similarly, if any such Tax is initially paid
by Buyer, and Buyer gives written notice to Seller that includes a copy of
the Tax Return for the Straddle Period and provides reasonable detail
concerning the calculation of the portions of Tax attributable to the Pre-
Effective Time Straddle Period, within 30 days Seller shall pay Buyer the
portion properly attributable to such Pre-Effective Time Straddle Period, but
only to the extent that such Tax is not taken into account in the
determination of Net Working Capital or otherwise taken into account as a
Purchase Price adjustment under Section 13.1.

(i) Seller and Buyer agree to furnish to each other any and all information
and documents reasonably required to comply with Tax and financial reporting
requirements and audits.

Section 8.12. _Press Releases_. Unless consultation is prohibited by
Applicable Law, Buyer and Seller shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation (but no approval thereof shall be required). 

 



43 Section 8.13. _Books and Records_. At or promptly after Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer all records of the Companies that are in Sellers control,
including original minute books and other corporate books and records and
accounts. Seller will deliver to Buyer, at Buyers expense, all of the rights
of way easements, rights of way option agreements, files, assignments,
operating records and agreements, engineering records, financial and
accounting records (but not including general financial accounting or tax
accounting records), and other similar files and records of the Companies
which directly relate to the Properties, other than those which Seller
considers to be proprietary or confidential, or which Seller cannot provide to
Buyer without, in its opinion, breaching, or risking a breach of, agreements
with other parties, or waiving, or risking waiving, legal privilege. Buyer
agrees that Seller may retain copies of all files transferred to Buyer
pursuant to this Section 8.13.

 

Section 8.14. _Rights to "Cardinal" Name, Derivations of Name and Logo_. Buyer
agrees that Seller shall retain all rights to the "Cardinal" name, logo, and
all derivatives thereof, and that Buyer may not use such names, logos, or
derivations in any manner without the prior written consent of Seller. Within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall remove all names and
markers used by Seller or the Companies and all variations and derivations
thereof and logos relating thereto from the Properties.

Section 8.15. _Amendments to the Certificates of Formation of the Companies_.
Immediately after the Closing, Buyer agrees to file an amendment to each
Companys certificate of formation in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller
that provides for a change in the name of such Company, which name does not
contain the word "Cardinal" or any derivative thereof and is otherwise
reasonably acceptable to Seller. 

Section 8.16. _HSR Filing_. If compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), is required in
connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable on the date hereof or such other date as shall be
mutually agreed by Seller and Buyer, Seller and Buyer will file with the
Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, as applicable, the
required notification and report forms and will as promptly as practicable
furnish any supplemental information which may be requested in
connection therewith. Seller and Buyer will request expedited treatment
(i.e., early termination) of such filing. Buyer and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make or modify all other filings and
submissions on a prompt and timely basis in connection with the filings
required by this Section. Each of Seller and Buyer will bear its own costs and
expenses relating to the compliance with this Section.

Section 8.17. _Release of Credit Facility Liens_. Seller or the Companies will
reach mutually satisfactory arrangements with the lender(s) under the Credit
Facility (a) for the payment by Seller at Closing of all outstanding
indebtedness existing under the Credit Facility as of the Closing Date and (b)
for the delivery at Closing of executed releases by the lender(s) (in a form
satisfactory to the lender(s) and reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) of all
mortgages or other Liens existing on the Properties as security under the
Credit Facility.

 



44 Section 8.18. _Financial Statements._

 

(a) Subject to Buyers satisfaction of its obligations under Section 8.18(d),
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be
delivered to Buyer on or before (i) the 65th day after the Closing Date, in
each case, only to the extent required of Buyer by Form 8-K under the Exchange
Act, (A) the audited consolidated financial statements of Seller for the year
ended December 31, 2011 and (B) the unaudited consolidated financial
statements of Seller for the nine month period ended September 30, 2012 (or,
if the Closing Date is on or after January 1, 2013, the audited consolidated
financial statements of Seller for the year ended December 31, 2012 in lieu of
statements for the nine month period ended September 30, 2012) and the related
footnotes, as shall be reasonably necessary for inclusion in Buyers current
report on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act to be filed on or before the 71st
calendar day after the initial Form 8-K to be filed within four (4) Business
Days following the closing and (ii) the 45th day after the Closing Date, to
the extent required of Buyer by Form 10-Q or Form 10-K under the Exchange Act,
a balance sheet relating to the Business as at December 1, 2012, which shall
have been reviewed by Deloitte LLP. Without limiting the generality of the
forgoing, Seller shall have no obligation to provide or cause to be provided
anything that is not required by Form 8-K or Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as
applicable, and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
the periods and dates presented of financial statements and other information
to be included by the Form 8-K, including, by promptly seeking waivers,
exemptions or advice from the staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or
cause to be delivered to Buyer on or before the date of the filing of the Form
8-K, the report of Deloitte LLP with respect to those portions of the
financial statements to be delivered under this Section 8.18 for which such
report is required by Form 8-K. Furthermore, Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts assist Buyer in causing Deloitte LLP to deliver to Buyer
any unqualified audit opinions with respect to the financial statements
relating to the Business as may be required by the Exchange Act in connection
with any future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission to be made
by Buyer.

 

(b) Subject to Buyers satisfaction of its obligations under Section 8.18(d),
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer to prepare
or cause to be prepared, on or before February 15, 2013, audited financial
statements and the related footnotes for Centrahoma JV, as required by the
Centrahoma JV Agreement. 

(c) Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for all (i) third party billed fees,
costs and expenses and (ii) reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Seller with respect to Sellers obligations under Section 8.18(a).

(d) Buyer shall cooperate with and reasonably assist Seller in the discharge
of Sellers obligations under Section 8.18(a).

 

(e) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such financial
and other information, records and documents relating to the Companies and
Centrahoma JV as may be necessary for Seller to prepare or cause to be
prepared audited financial

 



45  statements of Seller for the year ended December 31, 2012, or such other
financial statements required by Seller, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide access to such of Buyers personnel, advisors and
accountants as may be necessary for Seller to prepare or cause to be prepared
such financial statements, and shall generally cooperate with Sellers
reasonable requests in order to facilitate such preparation.

(f) Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer for all (i) third party billed fees,
costs and expenses and (ii) reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Buyer with respect to Buyers obligations under Section 8.18(e).

Section 8.19. _Non-Competition._

(a) From the Closing until two (2) years after the Closing Date, Seller will
not, and shall cause its Affiliates under its Control not to, directly or
indirectly engage in any business, or assist any person, entity, or other
business concern (other than Buyer or its Affiliates) to engage in any
business, with respect to (i) any natural gas gathering or processing
activities in Coal, Atoka, Hughes and Pittsburg Counties, Oklahoma, or (ii)
any contract gas treating for (A) any current gas treating customer of Seller
or the Companies as identified on Section 8.19 of the Disclosure Schedule
within the county where the current gas treatment project for such customer is
located as identified on Section 8.19 of the Disclosure Schedule or (B) any
potential gas treating customer within five (5) miles of the location of any
current gas treating project of Seller or the Companies as identified on
Section 8.19 of the Disclosure Schedule. 

(b) Although Seller agrees and acknowledges that (i) the covenants set forth
in this Section 8.19 are reasonably limited in time and in all other
respects, (ii) the covenants set forth in this Section 8.19 are reasonably
necessary for the protection of Buyer, (iii) Buyer would not have entered
into this Agreement but for the covenants of Seller contained in this Section
8.19 and (iv) the covenants contained herein have been made in order to induce
Buyer to enter into this Agreement, if this is determined not to be the case
by a judge or court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer and Seller specifically
request that the limitations contained in this Section 8.19 be reformed to the
extent necessary to make this Section 8.19 enforceable.

 

(c) Seller acknowledges that Sellers violation or threatened or attempted
violation of the covenants contained in this Section 8.19 may cause
irreparable harm to Buyer and its Affiliates and that money damages may not be
sufficient remedy for any breach of these sections. Seller agrees that Buyer
and its Affiliates shall be entitled as a matter of right to equitable
relief, including entry of an ex parte temporary restraining order in state or
federal court, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against activities
in violation of this Section 8.19, or both, or other appropriate judicial
remedy, writ or order, in any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any
violation or further violation of such covenants by Seller or others acting on
Sellers behalf. Such remedies will be in addition to all other remedies
available to Buyer and its Affiliates, in accordance with this Agreement.

 



46 _Article IX._

 

Buyers Due Diligence Examination

Section 9.1. _Due Diligence Examination_. From the Execution Date until 5:00
p.m. (local time in Dallas, Texas) on the twentieth (20th) day thereafter (the
"Examination Period"), each Company shall afford Buyer and its authorized
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the records
of such Company at the offices of Seller for the purposes of determining
whether Title Defects (as defined below) exist ("Buyers Review"); provided,
however, that such investigation shall be upon reasonable notice and shall not
unreasonably disrupt the personnel and operations of Seller or such Company or
impede the efforts of Seller or such Company to comply with their other
obligations under this Agreement. Such books and records shall include files,
assignments, operating records and agreements, financial and accounting
records, engineering records, in each case insofar as same may now be in
existence and in the possession of a Company, excluding, however, any
information that a Company is prohibited from disclosing by bona fide, third
party confidentiality restrictions; provided, that: (i) any information
withheld on such basis shall be identified with as much specificity and detail
as reasonably possible without breaching such obligation, and (ii) if
requested by Buyer, such Company shall use its Reasonable Efforts to obtain
a waiver of any such restrictions in favor of Buyer. Subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, Seller shall give Buyer, or Buyers authorized
representatives, at all reasonable times during the Examination Period and
upon adequate notice to Seller, physical access to the Properties for the
purpose of inspecting same. The cost and expense of Buyers Review, if any,
shall be borne solely by Buyer. Buyer shall not contact any of the customers
or suppliers of Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in person or by telephone, mail or other means of
communication, without the specific prior authorization of Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

Section 9.2. _Assertion of Title Defects_. If Buyer discovers any Title
Defects prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, Buyer shall notify
the appropriate Company as soon as possible and no later than the expiration
of the Examination Period of such alleged Title Defect. To be effective, such
notice ("Title Defect Notice") must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received by
the appropriate Company prior to the expiration of the Examination Period,
(iii) describe the Title Defect in reasonable detail including the basis
therefor (including any supporting documents in possession of Buyer), (iv)
identify the specific Properties to which such Title Defect relates, and (v)
include the Title Defect Amount as determined by Buyer in good faith. Any
matters that may otherwise constitute Title Defects, but of which the
appropriate Company has not been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance
with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all
purposes. It being expressly understood that Buyers sole and exclusive rights
and remedies with respect to any matter that constitutes a Title Defect shall
be those set forth in this Article IX and Section 12.1(d), and Buyer shall not
be entitled to refuse to close (other than pursuant to Section 10.1(d)), to
indemnification or any other right or remedy with respect to any Title Defect.
Upon the receipt of such effective Title Defect Notice from Buyer, a Company
shall have the option, in addition to the rights set forth in this Article
IX, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure such Title Defect at any time
prior to the Closing.

 

Section 9.3. _Title Defect Amount_. With respect to each Title Defect that is
properly asserted and not cured on or before the Closing Date, the Base
Purchase Price shall be reduced,

 



47  subject to Section 9.7, by the Title Defect Amount with respect to such
Title Defect Property. The Property (or portion thereof) affected by such
uncured Title Defect shall be a "Title Defect Property." The "Title Defect
Amount" resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount by which the value
of the Title Defect Property is reasonably reduced as a result of the
existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the
following terms and conditions:

(a) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(b) if a Title Defect is a Lien that is undisputed and liquidated in amount,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to
remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

 

(c) if a Title Defect represents an obligation or Lien upon or other defect in
title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above, the Title
Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the portion of the
Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the
Title Defect, the reasonably estimated potential economic effect of the Title
Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the values and estimated
cost to cure placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller and such other
reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;
provided, however, that if such Title Defect is reasonably capable of being
cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the reasonable cost
and expense of curing such Title Defect;

 

(d) if a Title Defect relates to an ownership gap in a right-of-way included
in the Property, the Title Defect Amount shall be the reasonable estimated
costs and expenses necessary to cure such gap, or alternatively, to construct
an alternative route for the pipeline system around such gap, including the
cost of acquiring any necessary real property right-of-way and related
capital expenditures; and

(e) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder.

 

Section 9.4. _Defensible Title_. "Defensible Title" means, as of the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date, such title and ownership by a Company
that:

(a) entitles such Company to operate, maintain, repair, replace and use the
Pipeline and the Facilities of such Company in the same manner as they are
currently operated;

(b) entitles such Company to use the Easements and Permits of such Company to
the extent necessary to operate, maintain, repair, replace and use the
Pipeline and Facilities of such Company in the same manner as they are
currently used;

(c) is free and clear of all of all Liens, except Permitted Encumbrances; and

(d) reflects that all Consents of such Company which are applicable to or must
be complied with in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement have been obtained and complied with to the extent the failure to
obtain or comply with the same could render this transaction or any such sale,
assignment or transfer (or any right or interest affected thereby) void or
voidable.

 



48 Section 9.5. _Permitted Encumbrances_. "Permitted Encumbrances" shall mean
(A) Liens for Taxes which are not yet delinquent or which are being contested
in good faith and for which adequate reserves have been established; (B)
mechanics and materialmens Liens relating to the Properties, which
obligations are not yet due and pursuant to which Seller is not in default;
(C) Liens in the ordinary course of business that are minor defects and
irregularities in title or other restrictions that are of the
nature customarily accepted by prudent purchasers of midstream assets and
that do not materially affect the value or use of any property encumbered
thereby; (D) all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or
other actions by Governmental Entities in connection with the sale or
conveyance of midstream assets if the same are customarily obtained routinely
and subsequent to such sale or conveyance; (E) required third party consents
to assignments and similar agreements unless the failure to obtain such
consents would void the transfer or terminate a material right under a
Contract or Easement; (F) easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, Permits,
surface leases and other rights in respect of surface operations, pipelines,
grazing, logging, canals, ditches, reservoirs or the like, and easements for
streets, alleys, highways, pipelines, telephone lines, power lines, railways
and other easements and rights-of-way, on, over or in respect of any of the
Property to the extent such matters do not interfere with operations on the
Property; (G) Liens which (i) do not, individually or in the aggregate,
materially detract from the value of, or materially interfere with, the
operation, maintenance, repair, replacement and/or use of the Properties
subject thereto or affected thereby or (ii) are of a nature that would be
reasonably acceptable to a prudent owner or operator of natural gas assets and
facilities of a type similar to the Properties; (H) rights reserved to or
vested in any municipality or governmental, statutory or public authority to
control or regulate any of the Property in any manner, and all Applicable
Laws, rules and orders of governmental authority; (I) Liens created by Buyer
or its successors and assigns; (J) any Lien granted by a third party to
encumber properties or assets owned by such third party which also encumbers
the Easements; and (K) any deed of trust, mortgage or other Lien that will be
fully released at Closing.

Section 9.6. _Title Defects_. "Title Defect" shall mean a defect exists (A)
that causes Seller to not have Defensible Title to the Pipeline, Facilities,
Easements or Permits, and (B) for which a Title Defect Notice has been timely
and otherwise validly delivered. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the following matters shall not constitute, and
shall not be asserted as, a Title Defect: (1) defects or irregularities
arising out of lack of corporate authorization or variation in corporate or
entity name; (2) defects or irregularities that have been cured or remedied by
the applicable statutes of limitation or statutes for prescription; (3)
defects or irregularities in the chain of title consisting of the failure to
recite marital status in documents or omissions of heirship Proceedings, and
(4) Permitted Encumbrances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Title Defect may
be asserted with respect to the Properties listed on Section 4.24 of the
Disclosure Schedule.

 



49 Section 9.7. _Base Purchase Price Adjustments for Title Defects_. 

(a) If a Company and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement as to whether a
Title Defect exists or the Title Defect Amount applicable to any Title
Defect, the provisions of Article XVII shall be applicable.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Base Purchase Price adjustment with respect to a particular Title Defect
which would result from the above provided for procedures does not exceed
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) ("Title Defect Threshold"), no adjustment
shall be made for such Title Defect, it being expressly understood that if the
adjustment for such Title Defect exceeds the Title Defect Threshold, the
entire Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect shall be included in the
calculation of the total amount of all Title Defects for which an adjustment
is to be made pursuant to this Article IX ("Total Defect Amount"). In the
event the Total Defect Amount does not exceed one and a half percent (1.5%)
of the Base Purchase Price, then no adjustment of the Base Purchase Price
shall occur. If the Total Defect Amount, in the aggregate, exceeds one and a
half percent (1.5%) of the Base Purchase Price, the Base Purchase Price shall
be adjusted by the amount by which the Total Defect Amount exceeds one and a
half percent (1.5%) of the Base Purchase Price.

_Article X._

threatened before any court or Governmental Entity seeking to restrain or
prohibit, or obtain material damages or other material relief in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

and for which the reasons why such condition is not met relate to some, but
less than all, of the Properties, Seller

 



51  may require that any dispute with regard to whether or not such condition
was met and any failure of such condition to be met be treated as an uncured

compliance therewith shall have been waived by Seller) each and every
covenant and agreement required by this Agreement to be performed or complied
with by Buyer prior to or at the Closing.

in breach of their obligations hereunder, this Agreement may, at the option of
Seller, be terminated. in which case the parties shall have no further
obligations to one another hereunder (other than as specifically provided in
Section 12.2 hereof, which will survive the termination). If Seller proceeds
to Closing with Knowledge of any condition precedent above not being met by
Buyer, such condition precedent will be deemed waived by Seller as a condition

or warranty related thereto.

real property Taxes pursuant to subsection (b)(ii) below) which are
attributable to the Companies, the Properties or the CAM Centrahoma JV
Interest before the Effective Time.

Section 13.2. _Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Procedure._

 

(a) The Purchase Price delivered at the Closing pursuant to Section 11.3(a)
shall be adjusted in accordance with the following procedures. Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer not less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date (i) estimated balance sheets of the Companies (on a combined
basis) and Centrahoma JV as of the Effective Time (together with supporting
documentation reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify each estimated balance
sheet, the "Estimated Balance Sheets"), (ii) worksheets showing Sellers
estimate of the Net Working Capital derived from the Estimated Balance Sheets
(based upon, and subject to the adjustments set forth in, the definitions of
Current Assets and Current Liabilities as set forth herein) (the "Estimated
Net Working Capital"), and (iii) Sellers estimate of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount (the "Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount"). The
Estimated Balance Sheets, the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Estimated
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount (collectively, the "Estimated Closing
Items") shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice and
consistent with the principles and assumptions used in preparation of the Net
Working Capital and Purchase Price Adjustment Amount Illustration attached as
Exhibit 13.2(a) hereto.

Adjustment Amount.

 

(c) If the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount is a negative number,
the Purchase Price delivered at the Closing pursuant to Section 11.3(a) shall

Section 13.3. _Final Purchase Price Adjustment Procedure._

(a) No later than sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date (or such
later date as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller), Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer (i) balance sheets of the Companies (on a combined basis)
and Centrahoma JV as of the Effective Time (together with supporting
documentation reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify each estimated balance
sheet, the "Final Balance Sheets"), (ii) worksheets showing Sellers
calculation of the Net Working Capital derived from the Final Balance Sheets
(based upon, and subject to the adjustments set forth in, the definitions of
Current Assets and Current Liabilities as set forth herein) (the "Final Net
Working Capital"), and (iii) Sellers calculation of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount ("Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount"), in each case,
together with a worksheet showing the difference, if any, between any
Estimated Closing Item and the corresponding Final Closing Item (as defined
below). The Final Balance Sheets, the Final Net Working Capital and the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount (collectively, the "Final Closing Items")
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice of Seller and
consistent with the principles and assumptions used in preparation of the
Estimated Closing Items. If Seller does not deliver the Final Closing Items
in accordance with this Section 13.3(a) on or before the sixtieth (60th)
calendar day after the Closing Date (or such later date as mutually agreed by
Buyer and Seller), Buyer shall have the right to prepare such Final Closing
Items on or before the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date (or such
later date as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller), in which case the
relative obligations of Buyer and Seller in the remainder of this Section 13.3
shall be switched. Buyer and Seller shall promptly provide to each other all
documents reasonably requested by the other to verify any of the items set
forth in the Final Closing Item calculations. Buyer shall have the right for
thirty (30) days following receipt of the Final Closing Items to object to the
Final Balance Sheet(s) and the proposed calculation of the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount. Buyer and its Representatives shall be entitled to
access during normal business hours to all books and records of Buyer and
Centrahoma JV as may be reasonably requested by Buyer for the purpose of this
Section 13.3. Any objection made by Buyer shall be made in writing and shall
set forth such objection in reasonable detail. Buyer shall be deemed to have
waived any rights to object under this Section 13.3 unless Buyer furnishes
its written objections to Seller within such thirty (30) day period. If Buyer
delivers an objection within such thirty (30) day period, then Buyer and
Seller shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the objections. If, at the end
of a fifteen (15) day period from the date of delivery of any objection by
Buyer or such longer period as may be mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller,
there are any objections that remain in dispute, then the remaining
objections in dispute shall be submitted for

 



57  resolution to an independent accounting firm to be selected jointly by
Seller and Buyer within the following five (5) Business Days (the "Referee").
The Referee shall determine the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the objections that remain in dispute
are submitted to it, but in any event within thirty (30) days after such
objections that remain in dispute are submitted to it. If any objections are
submitted to the Referee for resolution, (i) each of Buyer and Seller shall
furnish to the Referee such workpapers and other documents and information
relating to such objections as the Referee may request and are reasonably
available to that Party (or its independent public accountants) and will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Referee any material relating to
the determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such determination
with the Referee; (ii) the Referee must adopt the amount of the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount submitted by either Buyer or Seller and may not adopt
any other amount; (iii) the determination by the Referee of the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, as set forth in a written notice delivered
to both Buyer and Seller by the Referee, shall be made in accordance with this
Agreement and shall be binding and conclusive on the parties and, absent
manifest error, shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and
unappealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereof; and (iv) the fees and expenses of the Referee shall be
paid (1) by Buyer if the Referee adopts the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount submitted by Seller and (2) by Seller if the Referee adopts the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount submitted by Buyer. The Referee and
procedures set forth herein shall be the sole method for resolving any
disputes regarding the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount or the
provisions of this Section 13.3 in lieu of the provisions set forth in Article
XVII and Section 18.6.

 

(b) Following the final determination of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment

either Buyer or Seller ("Final Payment Amount") is more than Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000), the amount of the Final Payment Amount in excess of Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($50,000) shall be promptly (but in any event within five
(5) Business Days of the determination of the Final Payment Amount) paid by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to Buyer or Seller, as

Section 13.4. _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. All amounts to be paid under

Damages (individually a "Sellers Indemnified Claim" and collectively
"Sellers Indemnified Claims") to the extent arising out of or resulting
from:

(a) any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or agreement of
Buyer contained in this Agreement (during the period of survival thereof

THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATIONS BY BUYER SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH
DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, OR SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF
ACTION, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (i)
NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT INCLUDING

LIABILITY, OR (iii) ANY VIOLATION OF ANY LAW, RULE, REGULATION OR ORDER
RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING APPLICABLE
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. 

Section 14.2. _Indemnification By Seller_.

 

(a) From and after Closing, Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold Buyer (and
its Affiliates, their respective successors and assigns and their respective
owners, directors, officers, managers and employees) harmless from and against
any and all Damages (individually a "Buyers Indemnified Claim" and

(i) any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or agreement of
Seller or a Company contained in this Agreement that survives the Closing for
the period of such survival as set forth in Section 14.3;

(ii) those matters disclosed in Section 3.11 of the Disclosure Schedule; or

(iii) except to the extent taken into account in the determination of Net

under Section 13.1, any Taxes of the Companies or related to the Properties
for which Seller is responsible under this Agreement.

(b) THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATIONS BY SELLER SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH
DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, OR SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION,
LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (i) NEGLIGENCE

Seller shall not have any obligation to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer (or its owners, directors, officers, and employees) with respect to any
Buyers Indemnified Claims for any breach of a representation or warranty
under this Agreement or for breach of Section 8.18 unless the aggregate of
such Buyers Indemnified Claims exceeds the Deductible, and in the event such
Buyers Indemnified Claims exceed the Deductible, only the value of Damages in
excess of the Deductible shall be considered in applying Section 14.2(a);
provided, however, that the Deductible shall not apply with respect to any
Buyers Indemnified Claims for any breach of the Fundamental Representations
or for Damages arising out of or resulting from those matters disclosed in
Section 3.11 of the Disclosure Schedule. In no event shall Seller have
liability for Damages with respect to any Buyers Indemnified Claims for any
breach of a representation or warranty under this Agreement or for breach of
Section 8.18 in excess of the Cap; provided, however, that the Cap shall not
apply with respect to any Buyers Indemnified Claims for any breach of the
Fundamental Representations or for Damages arising out of or resulting from
those matters disclosed in Section 3.11 of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

(d) Nothing in this Article XIV shall apply to Damages with respect to any and
all Title Defects, the Damages with respect to which shall be governed
exclusively by Article IX.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer (and
its Affiliates, their respective successors and assigns and their respective
owners, directors, officers, and employees) shall be deemed not to have
suffered any Damages under this Section 14.2 arising from claims based on
specific types of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses including in the
calculation of the Purchase Price or in the preparation of the Final Balance
Sheet. It is the intent of the Parties that (i) the procedures set forth in

shall provide the sole and exclusive remedies for claims relating to the
preparation of the Final Balance Sheet and the determination of the Purchase
Price and (ii) Buyer shall not have recourse pursuant to Section 14.2 for
breaches of representations and warranties contained in this Agreement to the
extent that the facts constituting any such breaches are taken into account

determining the Purchase Price.

 

Section 14.3. _Survival of Provisions_.

 

(a) All representations and warranties shall survive the Closing for the
Survival Period.

 

(b) Except for the covenants contained in Section 2.1, Article X and Section
18.10, which shall survive the Closing indefinitely, and the indemnity
obligation of Seller under Section 14.2(b), which shall survive for the
statute of limitations applicable to such

 



60  Taxes plus 60 days, all covenants of Seller, a Company or Buyer contained in
this Agreement shall survive for a period of six (6) months after the Closing
(i) except for any covenant which by its terms otherwise terminates as of a
specific date or is only made for a specified period and (ii) except for the
covenants contained in Section 8.8 (Officer and Director Resignation and
Release) and Section 8.9 (Indemnification of Officers and Directors), which
shall survive the Closing without limitation; _provided_ that to the extent
any representation or warranty survives for a longer period of time, the
covenants set forth in Section 14.2 shall survive for such longer period of
time solely with respect to such representation and warranty or covenant.

(c) The indemnity for Taxes contained in Section 14.2(b) shall survive for the
applicable statute of limitations and sixty (60) days thereafter.

 

(d) Written notice of any claim by Buyer for indemnification from Seller under
Section 14.2 arising during the Survival Period must be given by Buyer to
Seller no later than the end of the Survival Period as a condition precedent
to the right to enforce such claim for indemnification. In the event a Buyers
Indemnified Claim is timely and properly asserted, the covenants set forth in
Section 14.2 shall survive until such Buyers Indemnified Claim is satisfied,
but only with respect to such timely and properly asserted Buyers Indemnified
Claim.

 

Section 14.4. _Notice of Claim_. If indemnification pursuant to Section 14.1
or Section 14.2 is sought, the party seeking indemnification (the
"Indemnitee") shall give written notice to the indemnifying party of an event
giving rise to the obligation to indemnify, describing in reasonable detail
the factual basis for such claim, and shall allow the indemnifying party to
assume and conduct the defense of the claim or action with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee, and cooperate with the indemnifying party in
the defense thereof; provided, however, that the omission to give such notice
to the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any
liability which it may have to the Indemnitee, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party is prejudiced by the failure to give such notice and as
otherwise provided in Section 14.3. The Indemnitee shall have the right to
employ separate counsel to represent the Indemnitee if the Indemnitee is
advised by counsel that an actual or likely conflict of interest makes
it advisable for the Indemnitee to be represented by separate counsel and the
reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel shall be paid by the
indemnifying party.

Section 14.5. _No Commissions Owed_. Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold Buyer (and its partners and its and their Affiliates, and the respective
owners, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, contractors and agents of
such parties) harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of
action, liabilities, damages, losses, costs or expenses (including, without
limitation, court costs and attorneys fees) of any kind or character arising
out of or resulting from any agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged
to have been made by, or on behalf of, Seller or a Company with any broker or
finder in connection with this Agreement or the transaction contemplated
hereby. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller (and its partners
and its and their Affiliates and the respective owners, officers, directors,
employees, attorneys, contractors and agents of such parties) harmless from
and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, liabilities,
damages, losses, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, court costs
and attorneys fees) of any kind or character arising out of or resulting from

 



61  any agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to have been made by, or
on behalf of, Buyer, with any broker or finder in connection with this
Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby.

Section 14.6. _Net Amounts_. Any amounts recoverable by any party pursuant to
this Article XIV with respect to any Buyers Indemnified Claims or Sellers
Indemnified Claims, as the case may be, shall be decreased by any insurance
proceeds or other amounts relating to such Buyers Indemnified Claims or
Sellers Indemnified Claims, as the case may be, paid to such Indemnitee by
any Person (other than any Affiliate of such Indemnitee) not a party to this
Agreement. To the extent that any Buyers Indemnified Claims or Sellers
Indemnified Claims relate to CAI and give rise to a tax benefit to the
Indemnitee making the claim for indemnification (or an Affiliate of such
Indemnitee), then the claim for indemnification shall be reduced by an amount
equal to such tax benefit realized by such Indemnitee.

Section 14.7. _Manner of Payment and Release of Escrow Account_. Except with
respect to any outstanding Dispute arising from or relating to Article XIV
(including this Section 14.7) which is in the process of resolution under
Section 17.1:

 

(a) Any indemnification with respect to any Buyers Indemnified Claims or
Sellers Indemnified Claims pursuant to this Article XIV shall be effected by
wire transfer of immediately available funds from the indemnifying party (or
the Escrow Account, as applicable) to an account designated in writing by the
applicable Indemnitee within ten (10) Business Days after a final
determination thereof;

(b) In the event any amount is owed by Seller pursuant to Section 14.2, such
amount shall first be satisfied from the Escrow Account (to the extent funds
from the Escrow Account are sufficient); and

 

(c) In the event that any funds remain in the Escrow Account on the Escrow
Termination Date, Buyer and Seller shall execute joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release such funds to
Seller; _provided,_ that, if there are any Buyers Indemnified Claims
hereunder that are properly pending but unresolved on such date, the
applicable portion of funds in the Escrow Account that are subject to such
claims shall not be released until such applicable claims are finally resolved
in accordance with this Agreement at which time Buyer and Seller shall execute
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent
to release such funds to Seller.

_Article XV. _

Casualty Losses

In the event of damage by fire or other casualty to the Properties after the
date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing ("Casualty Loss"), then
subject to Section 12.1: (a) this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect; (b) Buyer shall take title to the Property affected by such damage
without reduction of the Purchase Price; and (c) Seller shall, at Sellers
sole election, either (i) assign to Buyer any property damage insurance
claims related to such damage and pay any deductibles, or (ii) repair or
replace such damaged property to a condition similar to

 



62  the condition of the affected Property immediately prior to the Casualty
Loss and retain all insurance claims and payments with respect thereto. Until
the Closing Date, Seller shall maintain the existing insurance coverage, and
in the event of a Casualty Loss which is not covered by insurance, except as
provided in this Section, Seller shall have no obligation to Buyer with
respect thereto; provided that, if Buyer so requests, and if Seller has not
repaired the damage or replaced the affected Property, Seller will assign any
rights it may have against third parties with respect to such damage.

_Article XVI._

 _Article XVII._

Dispute Resolution

Section 17.1. _Dispute Resolution_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Article XIII and Section 18.10, any and
all claims, disputes, controversies or other matters in question arising out
of or relating to this Agreement (all of which are referred to herein as
"Disputes") shall be resolved solely in accordance with this Section 17.1,
even though some or all of such Disputes are allegedly extra contractual in
nature, whether such Disputes sound in contract, tort, or otherwise, at law or
in equity, under state or federal law, whether provided by statute or the
common law, for damages or any other relief.

(b) If a Dispute occurs that the senior representatives of the parties
responsible for the transaction contemplated by this Agreement have been
unable, in good faith, to settle or agree upon within a period of fifteen (15)
days after written notice is given of such Dispute, Seller shall nominate
and commit one of its senior officers, and Buyer shall nominate and commit
one of its senior officers, to meet at a mutually agreed time and place not
later than thirty (30) days after written notice of the Dispute to attempt to
resolve same. If such senior management have been unable to resolve such
Dispute within a period of fifteen (15) days after such meeting, or if such
meeting has not occurred within forty-five (45) days following such written
notice of such Dispute, then any party shall have the right, by written
notice to the other, to resolve the Dispute (i) through the relevant
Independent Expert pursuant to Section 17.1(c).

 

(c) Each party shall have the right to submit Disputes (including the
existence of a Title Defect or the Title Defect Amounts attributable
thereto), to an independent expert appointed in accordance with this Section
17.1(c) (each, an "Independent Expert"), who shall serve as sole arbitrator.
The Independent Expert shall be appointed by mutual agreement of Seller and
Buyer from among candidates with experience and expertise in the area that is
the subject of such Dispute, and failing such agreement, such Independent
Expert for such Dispute shall be selected in accordance with the Rules (as
hereinafter defined). Disputes to be resolved by an Independent Expert shall
be resolved in accordance with mutually agreed procedures and rules and
failing such agreement, in accordance with the rules and procedures (including
timing) for arbitration provided in

 



64  Section 17.1(d). The Independent Expert shall be instructed by the parties
to resolve such Dispute as soon as reasonably practicable in light of the
circumstances. The decision and award of the Independent Expert shall be
binding upon the parties as an award under the Federal Arbitration Act and
final and nonappealable to the maximum extent permitted by law, and judgment
thereon may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction and enforced by
any party as a final judgment of such court. If the parties have any Dispute
as to the selection of an Independent Expert or an Independent Expert is not
selected within ten (10) days of the notice set forth in Section 17.1(b), any
party may elect to proceed with arbitration in accordance with Section
17.1(d).

(d) Any Dispute that is not resolved pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this Section 17.1 shall be settled exclusively and finally by arbitration in
accordance with this Section 17.1(d).

(i) Such arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the Federal Arbitration
Act. The validity, construction, and interpretation of this Section 17.1(d),
and all procedural aspects of the arbitration conducted pursuant hereto,
including the determination of the issues that are subject to arbitration
(i.e., arbitrability), the scope of the arbitrable issues, allegations of
"fraud in the inducement" to enter into this Agreement or this arbitration
provision, allegations of waiver, laches, delay or other defenses to
arbitrability, and the rules governing the conduct of the arbitration
(including the time for filing an answer, the time for the filing of
counterclaims, the times for amending the pleadings, the specificity of the
pleadings, the extent and scope of discovery, the issuance of subpoenas, the
times for the designation of experts, whether the arbitration is to be stayed
pending resolution of related litigation involving third parties not bound by
this Agreement, the receipt of evidence, and the like), shall be decided
by the arbitrators. The arbitration shall be conducted using the rules (but
not the auspices) of the American Arbitration Association (the "Rules") or any
successor when not in conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act.

 

(ii) All arbitration proceedings hereunder shall be conducted in Tarrant
County, Texas or such other mutually agreeable location.

(iii) Arbitration shall be commenced by the initiating party (the "claimant")
giving the other party (the "respondent") written notice of the intention to
arbitrate (the "Arbitration Demand"), which shall contain a statement setting
forth the nature of the dispute, the names and addresses of all other
parties, the amount involved, if any, the remedy sought, and the hearing
locale requested.

(iv) All arbitration proceedings hereunder shall be before a panel of three
(3) arbitrators. Each Person acting as an arbitrator must be impartial and
independent and have at least ten (10) years of experience in or relating to
the oil and gas industry. Seller and Buyer shall each appoint one arbitrator
within fifteen (15) days after the Arbitration Demand and the third arbitrator
shall be selected by the arbitrators appointed by Seller and Buyer within
fifteen (15) days after their 

 



65  appointment. If either Seller or Buyer has failed to designate an arbitrator
within fifteen (15) days after the Arbitration Demand or if the two appointed
arbitrators shall fail to select a third arbitrator within fifteen (15) days
after their appointment, then an arbitrator shall be selected by a U.S.
District Judge for the Northern District of Texas. Except as to the
impartiality or independence of an arbitrator, no party may dispute the
appointment of any arbitrator selected by the other party.

(v) Discovery shall be made pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
and completed within sixty (60) days of selection of the third arbitrator.

(vi) In deciding the substance of the Dispute, the arbitrators shall refer to
the substantive laws of the State of Texas for guidance (excluding choice-of-
law principles that might call for the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction). Matters relating to arbitration shall be governed by the
Federal Arbitration Act.

(vii) The arbitrators shall conduct a hearing within ninety (90) days after
appointment of the third arbitrator, and shall render a final decision
completely disposing of the Dispute that is the subject of such proceedings
as within thirty (30) days after the final hearing. The parties shall instruct
the arbitrators to impose time limitations they consider reasonable for each
phase of such proceeding, including, without limitation, limits on the time
allotted to each party for the presentation of its case and rebuttal. The
arbitrators shall actively manage the proceedings as they deem best so as to
make the proceedings fair, expeditious, economical and less burdensome
than litigation. To provide for speed and efficiency, the arbitrators may:
(i) limit the time allotted to each party for presentation of its case; and
(ii) exclude testimony and other evidence they deem irrelevant or cumulative.

 

(viii) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the parties expressly agree that the arbitrators shall have absolutely no
authority to award consequential, incidental, special, treble, exemplary or
punitive damages of any type under any circumstances regardless of whether
such damages may be available under Texas law, or any other laws, or under
the Federal Arbitration Act or the Rules.

(ix) The final decision of the arbitrators shall be in writing, be as brief
as possible, set forth the reasons for such final decision, and if the
arbitrators award monetary damages to either party, contain a certification by
the arbitrators that they have not included any incidental, special, treble,
exemplary or punitive damages. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the
arbitration proceeding and the arbitrators decision and award shall be
maintained in confidence by the parties and the parties shall instruct the
arbitrators to likewise maintain such matters in confidence.

 



66 (x) The fees and expenses of the arbitrators shall be borne equally by Seller
and Buyer.

(xi) The decision and award of the arbitrators shall be binding upon the
parties and final and nonappealable to the maximum extent permitted by law,
and judgment thereon may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction and
enforced by any party as a final judgment of such court.

 

 _Article XVIII._

Miscellaneous Matters

Section 18.1. _Further Assurances_. After the Closing, Seller shall execute
and deliver, and shall otherwise cause to be executed and delivered, from time
to time, such further instruments, notices, division orders, transfer orders
and other documents, and do such other and further acts and things, as may be
reasonably necessary to more fully and effectively grant, convey and assign
the Securities and the Properties to Buyer.

Section 18.2. _Waiver of Consumer Rights_. Buyer hereby waives its rights
under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices  Consumer Protection Act, Section
17.41 et seq., Business and Commerce Code, a law that gives consumers special
rights and protections, and any similar law in any other state to the extent
such Act or similar law would otherwise apply. After consultation with an
attorney of Buyers own selection, Buyer voluntarily consents to this waiver.
To evidence Buyers ability to grant such waiver, Buyer represents to Seller
that it (a) is in the business of seeking or acquiring, by purchase or lease,
goods or services for commercial or business use, (b) has knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that enable it to evaluate the
merits and risks of the transactions contemplated hereby, (c) is not in a
significantly disparate bargaining position, and (d) has consulted with, and
is represented by, an attorney of Buyers own selection in connection with
this transaction, and such attorney was not directly or indirectly identified,
suggested, or selected by Seller or an agent of Seller. 

Section 18.3. _Parties Bear Own Expenses/No Special Damages_. Each party shall
bear and pay all expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees)
incurred by it in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY NEITHER PARTY SHALL
HAVE ANY OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR OTHERWISE IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH, FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES. For purposes of the foregoing, actual damages may, however,
include indirect, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages
to the extent (i) the injuries or losses resulting in or giving rise to such
damages are incurred or suffered by a Person which is not an Indemnitee
pursuant to the Agreement or an Affiliate of such Indemnitee and (ii) such
damages are recovered against an Indemnitee by a Person which is not
Indemnitee or an Affiliate of such Indemnitee. This Section shall operate only
to limit a partys liability and shall not operate to increase or expand any
contractual obligation of a party hereunder or cause any contractual
obligation of a party hereunder to survive longer than provided in Section
14.3.

 



67 Section 18.4. _Transfer Taxes_. No Transfer Tax will be collected at Closing
from Buyer in connection with this transaction. If, however, this transaction
is later deemed to be subject to Transfer Tax, for any reason, Buyer agrees to
be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless, for
any and all Transfer Taxes due by virtue of this transaction and Buyer shall
remit such Transfer Taxes at that time. Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate
with each other in demonstrating that the requirements for exemptions, if any,
from such Transfer Taxes have been met. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, any Transfer Taxes imposed as a result of the transactions
contemplated by Section 8.3 shall be solely the responsibility of Seller.

 

Section 18.5. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the parties hereto with respect to subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions
among the parties with respect to such subject matter.

Section 18.6. _Choice of Law, etc_. Without regard to principles of conflicts
of law, this Agreement, and all claims of causes of action (whether in
contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be construed
and enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Texas
applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such state
and the laws of the United States of America, except that, to the extent that
the law of a state in which a portion of the Properties is located (or which
is otherwise applicable to a portion of the Properties) necessarily governs,
the law of such state shall apply as to that portion of the property located
in (or otherwise subject to the laws of) such state. EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 18.7. _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

Section 18.8. _No Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding on and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, provided that neither party shall have the right to assign this
Agreement, including any indemnification rights, or any obligations
or benefits hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party
first having been obtained. Any transfer in absence of such consent shall be
null and void.

Section 18.9. _Counterpart Execution_. For execution, this Agreement may be
executed in counterparts, all of which are identical and all of which
constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary for Buyer,
Seller and the Companies to sign the same counterpart. This instrument may be
validly executed and delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission.

 



68 Section 18.10. _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) THE PARTIES HERETO HAVE VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO DEFINE THEIR RIGHTS,
LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS RESPECTING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT
EXCLUSIVELY IN CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT; AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO RELY ON THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO SUCH PARTY IN ARTICLE III, ARTICLE IV,
ARTICLE V, AND ARTICLE VII HEREIN, THE PARTIES HERETO EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM THAT
THEY ARE OWED ANY DUTIES OR ARE ENTITLED TO ANY REMEDIES NOT EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHERMORE, THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
THIS AGREEMENT EMBODIES THE JUSTIFIABLE EXPECTATION OF SOPHISTICATED PARTIES
KNOWLEDGEABLE IN BUSINESS AND DERIVED FROM VOLUNTARY, ARMS LENGTH
NEGOTIATIONS; ALL PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO
PARTY HAS ANY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER PARTY THAT WOULD JUSTIFY ANY
EXPECTATION BEYOND THAT OF AN ORDINARY BUYER AND AN ORDINARY SELLER IN AN
ARMS LENGTH TRANSACTION; THAT IS, NO FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP OR DUTY EXISTS.
THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY BREACH OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF

SUCH CLAIMS ARE HEREBY WAIVED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. EACH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS CONTENTS, AND SIGNS THIS AGREEMENT AS
ITS OWN FREE ACT. EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY WARRANTS THAT IT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED
BY LEGAL COUNSEL IN THIS MATTER, AND LEGAL COUNSEL HAS READ AND EXPLAINED TO
EACH PARTY THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND ITS WAIVERS AND RELEASES

AGREEMENT, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH SUIT SHALL BE A BREACH OF THIS

(b) If the Closing does not occur due to the breach of Seller, Seller agrees
that Buyers legal remedies will be inadequate and that the Properties are
unique. The sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer shall be the right to specific
performance under Applicable Law and Buyer shall not be entitled to recover
any monetary damages; provided however, if the foregoing limitation of Buyers
remedy to specific performance should for any reason be legally unenforceable,
then the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer, in such event, shall instead be
any right to recover actual direct damages for such breach.

 

(c) Upon Closing, Buyer shall also be deemed to have waived, to the fullest
extent permitted under Applicable Law, any right to contribution against
Seller (including, without limitation, any contribution claim arising under
any Applicable Environmental Law) and any and all other rights, claims and
causes of action it may have against Seller arising under or based on any
federal, state or local statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or common
law or otherwise.
