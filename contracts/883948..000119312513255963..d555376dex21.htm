iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of June 9, 2013, between UNION FIRST MARKET BANKSHARES
CORPORATION, a Virginia corporation ("Union"), and STELLARONE CORPORATION, a
Virginia corporation ("StellarOne").

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Union and StellarOne have approved, and
deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders
to consummate, the business combination transaction provided for herein in
which StellarOne will merge with and into Union (the "Merger");

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Union and StellarOne have each determined
that the Merger is consistent with and will further their respective business
strategies and goals; and

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that, for federal income tax
purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
and that this Agreement shall constitute, and is adopted as, a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

The Merger and Related Matters



     | 1.1 | The Merger. 
---|---|--- 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Date
(as defined in Section 1.2) and in accordance with the Virginia Stock
Corporation Act (the "VSCA"), StellarOne will be merged with and into Union
pursuant to the Plan of Merger, substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 1.1(a) and made a part hereof (the "Plan of Merger"). The separate
corporate existence of StellarOne thereupon shall cease, and Union will be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (Union is referred to herein as the
"Continuing Corporation" whenever reference is made to it as of the Effective
Date or thereafter). The Merger will have the effect set forth in Section
13.1-721 of the VSCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from
and after the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation shall possess all
rights, privileges, properties, immunities, powers and franchises of
StellarOne, and all of the debts, liabilities, obligations, claims,
restrictions and duties of StellarOne shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, claims, restrictions and duties of the Continuing Corporation. ---|---|--- 

(a) The Merger will become effective on the date and at the time shown on the
Certificate of Merger issued by the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the
"SCC") effecting the Merger (the "Effective Date"). Subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, the parties
will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Effective Date to occur on
or before January 1, 2014, or on such other date as the parties may agree in
writing. At or after the Closing Date (as defined herein), Union and
StellarOne will execute and deliver Articles of Merger meeting the
requirements of Section 13.1-720 of the VSCA, including containing the Plan of
Merger to the SCC.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, if at any time after
January 1, 2014 the conditions set forth in Article 6 shall have been
satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (as
defined herein) and the Closing does not occur within five (5) business days
thereafter, and a record date for any dividend or other distribution in
respect of the Union Common Stock (as defined herein) is taken after the end
of such five (5) day period such that the StellarOne stockholders will not be
entitled to participate in such dividend, each holder of StellarOne Common
Stock (as defined herein) shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender of the
Old StellarOne Certificates (as defined herein) and compliance with the other
provisions of Article 2, a payment equal to the difference between (i) the
amount and kind of dividend or other distribution that such holder would have
received had such holder been a holder of record of the shares of Union Common
Stock issuable to such holder in the Merger on the record date for such
dividend or other distribution and (ii) the amount and kind of dividend or
other distribution that such holder actually received as a holder of record of
the shares of StellarOne Common Stock for such same fiscal quarter.



     | 1.3 | Closing. 
---|---|--- 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. at the offices of
LeClairRyan, A Professional Corporation, Richmond, Virginia on a date mutually
agreed to by the parties (the "Closing Date"). All documents required by this
Agreement to be delivered at or prior to the Closing Date will be exchanged by
the parties at the Closing.



     | 1.4 | Corporate Governance and Related Matters. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Date, the Articles of Incorporation of
Union shall be amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common
stock, par value $1.33 per share, of Union ("Union Common Stock") from
36,000,000 to 100,000,000 shares.

(b) Prior to the Effective Date, Union shall take all actions necessary to
adopt the amendments to the Bylaws of Union substantially in the form set
forth in Exhibit 1.4(b), effective as of the Effective Date. On or prior to
the Effective Date, the Board of 

 



2  Directors of Union shall cause the number of directors that will comprise
the full Board of Directors of the Continuing Corporation at the Effective
Date to be fixed at such number, not to exceed nineteen (19), consisting of
(i) not more than eleven (11) current Union directors designated by Union,
including the current Chief Executive Officer of Union (the "Union
Directors"), and eight (8) current StellarOne directors to be designated
prior to the Effective Date by Stellar One, subject to the consent of Union
which shall not be unreasonably withheld (the "StellarOne Directors"). No
other directors of Union or StellarOne shall be designated to serve on the
Board of Directors of the Continuing Corporation at the Effective Date. The
Union Directors and StellarOne Directors will be split as equally as possible
among the three classes of directors to serve staggered terms.

 

(c) Subject to and in accordance with the Bylaws of the Continuing
Corporation, effective as of the Effective Date, (i) Dr. Raymond D. Smoot,
Jr. will serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Continuing
Corporation, (ii) Mr. Ronald L. Hicks will serve as Vice Chairman of the Board
of Directors of the Continuing Corporation and (iii) the officers of Union in
office immediately prior to the Effective Date, together with such additional
persons as may thereafter be appointed, shall serve as the officers,
respectively, of the Continuing Corporation from and after the Effective Date.

 



     | 1.5 | Banking Operations. 
---|---|--- 

(a) At and after the Effective Date, StellarOne Bank, the wholly-owned
Virginia chartered commercial bank subsidiary of StellarOne, shall operate as
a separate Virginia chartered commercial banking subsidiary of the Continuing
Corporation until such time as StellarOne Bank shall be merged (the
"Subsidiary Bank Merger") with and into Union First Market Bank, the wholly-
owned Virginia chartered commercial bank subsidiary of Union ("Union Bank").

 

(b) The officers and directors of StellarOne Bank immediately prior to the
Effective Date shall continue to be the officers and directors of StellarOne
Bank after the Effective Date until the effective date of the Subsidiary Bank
Merger, subject to the StellarOne Bank Board of Directors determination with
respect to the officers, after consultation with Union to reflect any
management changes occurring after the Effective Date. Prior to the effective
date of the Subsidiary Bank Merger, Union Bank and its Board of Directors
shall take all actions necessary to offer a board position with Union Bank to
those current members of the Board of Directors of StellarOne who are not
appointed to the Continuing CorporationÂ’s Board of Directors as of the
Effective Date, and to appoint such individuals to the Board of Directors of
Union Bank as of the effective date of the Subsidiary Bank Merger, including
amending the Bylaws of Union Bank for such purposes.



     | 1.6 | Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Continuing
Corporation. 
---|---|--- 

The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Union as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Date, as such Articles of Incorporation are proposed to
be amended as set 

 



3  forth in Section 1.4(a) hereof and as such Bylaws are proposed to be amended
as set forth in Exhibit 1.4(b) hereto, will be the Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the Continuing Corporation.



     | 1.7 | Tax Consequences. 
---|---|--- 

It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of
the Code.



     | 1.8 | Appraisal Rights. 
---|---|--- 

In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no appraisal rights shall be
available to the holders of StellarOne Common Stock in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 2

 

Merger Consideration; Exchange Procedures



     | 2.1 | Conversion of StellarOne Common Stock. 
---|---|--- 

At the Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Union or StellarOne or their respective stockholders:

 

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of StellarOne
("StellarOne Common Stock"), that is issued and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Date will be converted into and exchanged for 0.9739
shares of common stock, par value $1.33 per share, of the Continuing
Corporation ("Continuing Corporation Common Stock") pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan of Merger (the "Exchange
Ratio").

(b) All shares of StellarOne Common Stock converted pursuant to this Section
2.1 shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Date.

 

(c) Each certificate previously representing shares of StellarOne Common Stock
(the "Old StellarOne Certificates") shall cease to represent any rights
except the right to receive with respect to each underlying share of
StellarOne Common Stock: (i) a new certificate representing the number of
whole shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which the shares
of StellarOne Common Stock represented by the Old StellarOne Certificate have
been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1 upon the surrender of such Old
StellarOne Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, (ii) in accordance
with Section 2.3, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock; and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5.

 



4 (d) Each share of Union Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before
the Effective Date shall remain an issued and outstanding share of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock. Each certificate previously representing shares of
Union Common Stock shall continue to represent an equal number of shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock on and after the Effective Date.

(e) Each share of StellarOne Common Stock held by either party and each share
of Union Common Stock held by StellarOne or any of its Subsidiaries (as
defined herein) prior to the Effective Date (in each case other than in a
fiduciary or agency capacity or on behalf of third parties as a result of
debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist at the Effective Date and no consideration shall be issued in
exchange therefor; provided, that such shares of Union Common Stock shall
resume the status of authorized and unissued shares of Union Common Stock.



     | 2.2 | Exchange Procedures. 
---|---|--- 

(a) At the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with its transfer agent or such other transfer agent or
depository or trust institution of recognized standing approved by Union (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of the Old StellarOne
Certificates, certificates representing Continuing Corporation Common Stock
("New Certificates"), together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto and any cash to be paid hereunder in lieu of fractional
shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock, without any interest thereon
(the "Exchange Fund"), to be paid pursuant to Article 1 and this Article 2 in
exchange for outstanding shares of StellarOne Common Stock.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, and in no event later
than five (5) business days thereafter, the Continuing Corporation shall
cause the Exchange Agent to send to each former stockholder of record of
StellarOne immediately before the Effective Date transmittal materials for use
in exchanging such stockholderÂ’s Old StellarOne Certificates for New
Certificates based upon the Exchange Ratio.

(c) The Continuing Corporation shall cause the New Certificates for shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which shares of StellarOne Common
Stock are converted at the Effective Date or dividends or distributions which
such stockholder shall be entitled to receive and any cash to be paid in lieu
of fractional shares to be paid to such stockholder upon delivery to the
Exchange Agent of Old StellarOne Certificates, together with the transmittal
materials duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto. No interest will accrue or be paid on any such cash to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 2.5.

(d) A StellarOne stockholder whose Old StellarOne Certificates have been lost,
destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing shall be entitled to receive New
Certificates, dividends or distributions, and cash in lieu of fractional
shares, to which such stockholder shall be entitled upon compliance with
reasonable conditions imposed by Union pursuant to applicable law and as
required in accordance with UnionÂ’s standard policy (including
the requirement that the shareholder furnish a surety bond or other customary
indemnity).

 



5 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of StellarOne for twelve (12) months after the Effective Date
shall be returned to the Continuing Corporation (together with any dividends
or earnings in respect thereof). Any former stockholders of StellarOne who
have not complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter be entitled to look
only to the Continuing Corporation, and only as a general creditor thereof,
for payment of the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of
StellarOne Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, without any interest thereon.

(f) None of the Exchange Agent, either of the parties hereto or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be liable to any stockholder of StellarOne for
any amount of property delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



     | 2.3 | No Fractional Shares. 
---|---|--- 
 

Each holder of shares of StellarOne Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common
Stock multiplied by the closing sale price of Union Common Stock on the
NASDAQ Global Select Market for the trading day immediately preceding (but not
including) the Effective Date.

 



     | 2.4 | Anti-Dilution. 
---|---|--- 

In the event Union changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the
number of shares of Union Common Stock issued and outstanding before the
Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, appropriate and
proportional adjustments will be made to the Exchange Ratio.



     | 2.5 | Dividends. 
---|---|--- 

No dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of
StellarOne Common Stock at, or as of, any time after the Effective Date will
be paid to the holder of any Old StellarOne Certificates until such holder
physically surrenders such certificate (or furnishes a surety bond of a
customary indemnity that such certificate is lost, destroyed, stolen or are
otherwise missing) for exchange as provided in Section 2.2 of this Agreement,
promptly after which time all such dividends or distributions will be paid
(without interest).

 



6 ---|---|--- 

(a) At the Effective Date, each option to purchase shares of StellarOne Common
Stock (a "StellarOne Stock Option") granted under an equity or equity-based
compensation plan of StellarOne (a "StellarOne Stock Plan"), shall vest and
shall be converted into an option (each, a "Replacement Option") to acquire,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such StellarOne
Stock Option (except as provided otherwise in this Section 2.6(a)), the
number of shares of Union Common Stock equal to (i) the number of shares of
StellarOne Common Stock subject to the StellarOne Stock Option multiplied by
(ii) the Exchange Ratio. Such product shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole number. The exercise price per share (rounded up to the next whole cent)
of each Replacement Option shall equal (y) the exercise price per share of
shares of StellarOne Common Stock that were purchasable pursuant to such
StellarOne Stock Option divided by (z) the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each StellarOne Stock Option that is intended to be an "incentive
stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in
accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and all other
options shall be adjusted in a manner that maintains the options exemption
from Section 409A of the Code. At the Effective Date, Union shall assume the
StellarOne Stock Plans; provided that such assumption shall only be with
respect to the Replacement Options and the StellarOne Stock Awards (as defined
herein) and shall have no obligation to make any additional grants or
awards under the StellarOne Stock Plans.

(b) Each restricted stock award granted under a StellarOne Stock Plan (a
"StellarOne Stock Award") which is unvested or contingent and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Date, shall cease, at the Effective Date,
to represent any rights with respect to shares of StellarOne Common Stock and
shall be converted without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into
a restricted stock award of the Continuing Corporation (a "Continuing
Corporation Stock Award"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the StellarOne Stock Awards (but taking into account any changes
thereto, including any acceleration of vesting thereof, provided for in the
StellarOne Stock Plan or in the related award document by reason of the
Merger). The number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject
to each such Continuing Corporation Stock Award shall be equal to the number
of shares of StellarOne Common Stock subject to the StellarOne Stock Award
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole
share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock.

(c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, the Continuing
Corporation will deliver to the holders of Replacement Options and StellarOne
Stock Awards any required notices setting forth such holdersÂ’ rights pursuant
to the respective StellarOne Stock Plan and award documents and stating that
such StellarOne Stock Awards have been assumed by the Continuing Corporation
or that such Replacement Option has been issued by the Continuing Corporation
and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.6 after giving effect to the Merger
and the terms of the StellarOne Stock Plan).

 



7 ---|---|--- 

At the Effective Date, each Treasury Warrant (as defined herein), which is
then outstanding and unexercised shall cease to represent a right to acquire
StellarOne Common Stock and shall be converted into a warrant to purchase
shares of Union Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined
in accordance with the terms of such Treasury Warrant.



     | 2.8 | Withholding Rights. 
---|---|--- 

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such
amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax (as defined herein) law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority (as defined
herein) by the Exchange Agent, such amounts withheld will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.

---|---|--- 

(a) Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party has
delivered to the other party a letter (its "Disclosure Letter") setting forth,
among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate
either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
provision hereof or as an exception to one or more of such partyÂ’s
representations or warranties contained in Section 3.3 or to one or more of
its covenants or agreements contained in Articles 4 or 5; provided, that (i)
no such item is required to be set forth in a partyÂ’s Disclosure Letter as an
exception to any representation or warranty of such party if its absence would
not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect under the standard established by Section 3.2, and (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in a partyÂ’s Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by that party
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
(as defined herein) with respect to such party. 

(b) Any disclosures made with respect to a subsection of Section 3.3 shall be
deemed to qualify (i) any subsections of Section 3.3 specifically referenced
or cross-referenced and (ii) other subsections of Section 3.3 to the extent it
is reasonably apparent (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross
reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure (A) applies
to such other subsections and (B) contains sufficient detail to enable a
reasonable person to recognize the relevance of such disclosure to such other
subsections.

(a) No representation or warranty of Union or StellarOne contained in Section
3.3 (other than the representations and warranties contained in (i) Sections
3.3(c)(i), 3.3(d), 3.3(e) and 3.3(v), which shall be true in all material
respects with respect to it, and (ii) Sections 3.3(c)(ii)(A) and 3.3(h)(ii)
which shall be true and correct in all respects) will be deemed untrue or
incorrect, including for purposes of Sections 6.2(a) and 6.3(a), and no party
will be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as a
consequence of the existence or absence of any fact, event or circumstance
unless such fact, event or circumstance, individually or taken together with

or warranty contained in Section 3.3 has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on such party.

(b) The term "Material Adverse Effect," as used with respect to a party, means
an event, change, effect or occurrence which, individually or together with
any other event, change, effect or occurrence (i) is materially adverse to

party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) materially impairs the
ability of such party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on a timely basis; provided that in the case of clause (i) only a
Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A)
changes after the date of this Agreement in laws or regulations generally
affecting the banking and bank holding company businesses and the
interpretation of such laws and regulations by courts or governmental
authorities, (B) changes after the date of this Agreement in generally
accepted accounting principles or regulatory accounting requirements generally
affecting the banking and bank holding company businesses, (C) changes or
events after the date of this Agreement generally affecting the banking and

respective Subsidiaries, (D) the effects of the actions expressly permitted
or required by this Agreement or that are taken with the prior informed
consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (E) the public disclosure of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, (F) a decline in the trading price of a partyÂ’s common
stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections or
internal financial forecasts, but not including the underlying causes
thereof, and (G) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities or acts of
terrorism which involves the United States; except, with respect to clauses
(A), (B), (C) or (G), to the extent that the effects of such change are
materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, financial
condition or results of operations such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as compared to other companies in the industry in which such party and
its Subsidiaries operate. 

(c) The term "Knowledge" with respect to Union, shall mean the actual
knowledge, after due inquiry, of those individuals set forth in Section 3.2
of the Disclosure Letter of Union and, with respect to StellarOne, shall mean
the actual knowledge, after due inquiry, of those individuals set forth in

in the relevant Disclosure Letters or in any of such partyÂ’s SEC Reports (as
defined below) filed on or after January 1, 2013 and prior to the date hereof
(but excluding any risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements"
disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or
cautionary or forward-looking in nature), Union represents and warrants to
StellarOne, and StellarOne represents and warrants to Union, to the extent
applicable, as follows:

 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Power_. It is a Virginia corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Virginia.
It has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
conducted and to own and operate its assets, properties and business. It is
duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act
of 1956, as amended. True and complete copies of its Articles of
Incorporation, Bylaws or other similar governing instruments (the
"Organizational Documents"), in each case as amended to the date hereof and as
in full force and effect as of the date hereof, are set forth in Section
3.3(a) of its Disclosure Letter.

(b) _Subsidiaries._ Each of its Subsidiaries (i) is a duly organized bank,
corporation or statutory trust, validly existing and in good standing under
applicable laws, (ii) has full corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now conducted, and (iii) is duly qualified to do business in the
states where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification and where the failure to so qualify would
have a Material Adverse Effect on it on a consolidated basis. The outstanding
shares of capital stock or equity interests of each of its Subsidiaries are
validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable and all such
shares or equity interests are directly or indirectly owned by it free and
clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances or preemptive rights of any
person. No rights are authorized, issued or outstanding with respect to the
capital stock or equity interests of any of its Subsidiaries and there are no
agreements, understandings or commitments relating to the right to vote or to
dispose of the capital stock or equity interests of any of its Subsidiaries.
There are no restrictions on the ability of any of its Subsidiaries to pay
dividends or distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposits of each of its
Subsidiaries that is a commercial bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance
Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") to the maximum
extent permitted by law. A true and complete list of its direct and indirect
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof is set forth in Section 3.3(b) of its
Disclosure Letter that shows the jurisdiction of organization of each
Subsidiary, its form of organization (corporate, partnership, joint venture),
and lists the owner(s) and percentage ownership (direct or indirect) of each
Subsidiary.

The term "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party means any
corporation or other business organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, at least a majority of the securities or other interests of
which that have by their terms ordinary voting power

 



10  to elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar
functions with respect to such corporation or other organization is directly
or indirectly owned or controlled by such party or by any one or more of its
Subsidiaries.

(c) _Authority; No Breach of the Agreement._

 

(i) It has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement, and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, by it
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and
subject only to the receipt of:

(A) in the case of StellarOne, approval of this Agreement and the Plan
of Merger by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
StellarOne Common Stock (the "StellarOne Stockholder Approval"), and

(B) in the case of Union, approval of (1) the amendments to the Union Articles
of Incorporation as described in Section 1.4(a), and (2) this Agreement and
the Plan of Merger, each by the holders of a majority of the outstanding

This Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws affecting the enforcement of rights of creditors
or by general principles of equity. Union represents and warrants that the
Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, when issued,
will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

(ii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by it, nor the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by
it with any of the provisions hereof will: (A) conflict with or result in a
breach of any provision of its Organizational Documents; (B) constitute or
result in the breach of any term, condition or provision of, or constitute a
default under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration with respect to, or result in the creation of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon, any property or asset of it or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to any (1) note, bond, mortgage, indenture, or (2) any material
license, agreement or other instrument or obligation, to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their properties or assets may be bound; or (C) subject to the receipt of
all required regulatory and stockholder approvals, violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to it or any of
its Subsidiaries.

agreements, convertible or exchangeable securities, or other commitments,
contingent or otherwise, relating to its capital stock pursuant to which
Union is or may become obligated to make a cash payment or to issue shares of

(f) _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_. __

 

(i) It has filed all reports, registration statements, proxy statements,
offering circulars, schedules and other documents required to be filed by it
(collectively, the "SEC Reports") with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") since December 31, 2009 under the Securities Act of 1933, as 

 



12  amended (the "Securities Act"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), and, to the extent such SEC Reports are not
available on the SECÂ’s Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval
system, made available to the other party copies of such SEC Reports. Its SEC
Reports, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules contained
therein, (A) at the time filed, complied (and any SEC Reports filed after the
date of this Agreement will comply) in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and (B) at
the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by another SEC Report
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing),
did not (and any SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement will not)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated in such SEC Reports or necessary in order to make
the statements made in such SEC Reports, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

 

(ii) Each of its financial statements contained in or incorporated by
reference into any SEC Reports (including any SEC Reports filed after the
date of this Agreement) (the "Financial Statements") complied (or, in the case
of SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will comply) in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act with respect thereto, fairly presented (or, in the case of
SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present) the
consolidated financial position of it and its Subsidiaries as at
the respective dates and the consolidated results of its operations and cash
flows for the periods indicated, in each case in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP")
consistently applied during the periods indicated, except in each case as may
be noted therein, and subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and as
permitted by Form 10-Q in the case of unaudited financial statements.

 

(iii) It and each of its Subsidiaries has devised and maintains a system of
"internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with general or specific
authorization of its Board of Directors and the duly authorized executive
officers of such party, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP consistently
applied with respect to institutions such as such party or other criteria
applicable to such financial statements, and to maintain proper accountability
for items therein, (iii) access to its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ properties and
assets is permitted only in accordance with general or specific authorization
of its Board of Directors and the duly authorized executive officers of such
party, and (iv) the recorded accountability for items is compared with the
actual levels at reasonable intervals and appropriate actions taken
with respect to any differences.

(iv) Its "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all

 



13  information required to be disclosed by it in its SEC Reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECÂ’s rules and forms, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to its management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer required under the Exchange Act
with respect to such reports. It has disclosed, to its auditors and the audit
committee of its Board of Directors and on Section 3.3(f)(iv) of its
Disclosure Letter (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that
could adversely affect in any material respect its ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in its internal controls over financial reporting. For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall
have the meaning assigned to them in Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board Auditing Standard 2, as of the date hereof.

(v) Each of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer
(or each former principal executive officer and each former principal
financial officer, as applicable) has made all certifications required by
Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") with respect to its SEC Reports, and
the statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate in all
material respects. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It is in compliance with all applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect.

(g) _Bank Reports_. It and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all reports,
forms, correspondence, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto (the "Bank Reports"), that
they were required to file since December 31, 2009 with the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, the Bureau of Financial Institutions
of the Virginia State Corporation Commission and any other federal, state or
foreign governmental or regulatory agency or authority having jurisdiction
over it or each of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Regulatory
Agencies"), including any Bank Report required to be filed pursuant to the
laws of the United States, any state or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid
all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except
where the failure to file such Bank Report or to pay such fees and
assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on it. Any such Bank
Report regarding it or any of its Subsidiaries filed with or otherwise
submitted to any Regulatory Agency complied in all material respects with
relevant legal requirements, including as to content. Except for normal
examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of its
and its Subsidiaries business, there is no pending proceeding before,

 



14  or, to its Knowledge, examination or investigation by, any Regulatory Agency
into the business or operations of it or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no
unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any Regulatory Agency with
respect to any Bank Report or relating to any examination or inspection of it
or any of its Subsidiaries, and there has been no formal or informal inquiries
by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to
the business, operations, policies or procedures of it or any of its
Subsidiaries since December 31, 2009, in each case, which would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on it.

(h) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2012,
except as disclosed in the SEC Reports, Bank Reports or Financial Statements
filed by it or its Subsidiaries or made available to the other party prior to

Letter, (i) it and each of its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses and incurred liabilities only in the ordinary course consistent

other party prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) liabilities incurred

nor any of its Subsidiaries has, and since March 31, 2013 has not incurred
(except as permitted by Section 4.1), any liabilities or obligations of any

required to be reflected in the SEC Reports, Bank Reports or Financial
Statements of it or any of its Subsidiaries).

on Form 10-K filed prior to the date of this Agreement), as of the date
hereof, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, bound by or
subject to any agreement, contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding
(whether written or oral) (i) that is a "material contract" required to be
filed as an exhibit pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of the SECÂ’s Regulation S-K,
(ii) that restricts the conduct of business by it or any of its Subsidiaries
or its or their ability to compete in any line of business, (iii) with
respect to employment of an officer, director or consultant, (iv) that would
be terminable other than by it or any of its Subsidiaries or under which a
material payment obligation would arise or be accelerated, in each case as a
result of the announcement or consummation of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional acts or events), (v) that would require any consent or approval of
a counterparty as a result of the consummation of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein; (vi) pursuant to which the annualized

 



15  rent or lease payments are, or are reasonably expected to be, in excess of
$100,000; (vii) for the use or purchase of materials, supplies, goods,

being referred to as a "Material Contract"). Neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default under any Material Contract, and there has not
occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both, would constitute such a default.

 

(k) _Legal Proceedings; Compliance with Laws_. Except as set forth in Section
3.3(k) of its Disclosure Letter, there are no actions, suits or proceedings
instituted or pending or, to its Knowledge, threatened against it or any of
its Subsidiaries or against any of its or its SubsidiariesÂ’ properties,
assets, interests or rights, or against any of its or its SubsidiariesÂ’, or
to its Knowledge, any of its officers, directors or employees in their
capacities as such. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
subject to any agreement, order, memorandum of understanding,
enforcement action, or supervisory or commitment letter by or with any
Governmental Authority (as defined herein) restricting its operations or the
operations of any of its Subsidiaries or that relates to its capital adequacy,
its ability to pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its
management or its business and neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
advised by any Governmental Authority that any such Governmental Authority is
contemplating issuing or requesting the issuance of any such agreement,
order, memorandum, action or letter in the future. It and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with all laws, ordinances,
requirements, regulations or orders applicable to its business
(including environmental laws, ordinances, requirements, regulations or
orders). It and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since
December 31, 2009, held, all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership
of their respective properties, rights and assets (and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where neither the
cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license,
franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or
assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on it, and to its Knowledge no
suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, permit or
authorization is threatened. For the purposes of this Agreement, a
"Governmental Authority" means any court, administrative agency or commission
or other governmental authority, agency or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign, or any industry self-regulatory authority, and includes Regulatory
Agencies.

been timely paid, other than those that are being contested in good faith, as

of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be so
qualified, as reflected in a current favorable determination letter (based on

opinion letter, as applicable, or a filing for the same has been made with
the Internal Revenue Service seeking such a determination letter and that
request is still awaiting decision by the Internal Revenue Service (based on
Internal Revenue Service permitted determination request procedures). Nothing
has occurred since the date of any such determination that is reasonably
likely to affect adversely such qualification or exemption, or result in the
imposition of excise taxes or income taxes on unrelated business income under
the Code or ERISA with respect to any tax-qualified plan. There have been no
"terminations," "partial terminations" or "discontinuances of contributions,"

defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA, of any Benefit Plan has any liability for
breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA.

 

(viii) There are no actions, suits, investigations or claims pending, or to
its Knowledge threatened or anticipated, with respect to any of its Benefit
Plans (other than routine claims for benefits). None of its Benefit Plans is

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

(B) no Benefit Plan contains any provision that would give rise to any
severance, termination or other payments or liabilities as a result of the

welfare plan, as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, that provides for any post-
employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof,
except as required by Section 4980B of the Code. It has reserved the right to
amend, terminate or modify at any time all plans or arrangements providing for
retiree health or life insurance coverage, and no representations
or commitments, whether or not written, have been made that would limit its
right to amend, terminate or modify any such benefits.

(xi) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(n)(xi) of its Disclosure Letter, it
and its Subsidiaries have made prior to the date hereof all bonus and
commission payments to which they were required or are otherwise committed to
make to any employee or independent contractor under any Benefit Plan for
calendar years 2012 and 2013.

 



20 (xii) All "group health plans," as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code,
covering the employees of it or any of its Subsidiaries have been maintained

requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I
of ERISA.

outstanding and in full force and effect, and all premiums and other payments
due under any such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been
filed in due and timely fashion. Since December 31, 2012, neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of a premium increase or
cancellation or a failure to renew with respect to any insurance policy or
bond or, within the last three (3) calendar years and since January 1, 2013
has been refused any insurance coverage sought or applied for, and it has no
reason to believe that existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and
when the same shall expire upon terms and conditions as favorable as those
presently in effect, other than possible increases in premiums or
unavailability of coverage that do not result from any extraordinary loss
experience on the part of it or its Subsidiaries. Set forth in Section 3.3(o)
of its Disclosure Letter is a list of all insurance policies or bonds
currently maintained by it and its Subsidiaries.

Confidentiality.

keep the other party informed on a current basis) upon its becoming aware of
the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or circumstance known that (i)

(c) Each party hereto shall comply, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause each of its directors, officers, employees, attorneys and advisors to
comply, with all of their respective obligations under the Mutual
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 6, 2013 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), between Union and StellarOne, which agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth therein.

 



30 ---|---|---

and the parties will prepare a joint proxy statement and prospectus and other
proxy solicitation materials of Union and StellarOne constituting a part

or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Joint
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such
statement was made, not misleading. Each party further agrees that if it
becomes aware that any information furnished by it that would cause any of the
statements in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement to be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take
appropriate steps to correct the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement.



     | 5.5 | No Other Acquisition Proposals. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives (including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit or encourage or facilitate any inquiries or proposals with
respect to, (ii) furnish any confidential or nonpublic information relating
to, or (iii) engage or participate in any negotiations or discussions
concerning, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined herein).

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 5.5 shall
prohibit either party, prior to its respective meeting of stockholders to be
held pursuant to Section 5.3 and subject to compliance with the other terms
of this Section 5.5, from furnishing nonpublic information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to such
party (that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.5) if, and only to
the extent that (i) such partyÂ’s board of directors concludes in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
actions would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties to its stockholders under applicable law, (ii) before taking such
action, such party receives from such person or entity an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less restrictive with respect
to the confidential treatment of information by such party than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide
such person or entity with any exclusive right to negotiate with such party,
and (iii) such partyÂ’s board of directors concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal (as defined below). Each party shall immediately (within
twenty-four (24) hours) notify the other party orally and in writing of its
receipt of any such Acquisition Proposal, the material 

 



32  terms and conditions thereof, the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal, and will keep the other party apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including by
providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence relating
thereto.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, an "Acquisition Proposal" means, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or
inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, any of the
following transactions involving Union or StellarOne, or their respective
Subsidiaries: (i) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 10% of the consolidated
assets of the party; (ii) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of
10% or more of the consolidated assets of a party and its Subsidiaries or 10%
or more of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 10% of the consolidated assets of the party; or (iii) any tender offer
(including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in such third party beneficially owning 10% or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 10% of the
consolidated assets of the party.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a person or entity
(or group of persons or entities acting in concert within the meaning of Rule
13d-5 under the Exchange Act) that the Board of Directors of Union or
StellarOne, as the case may be, concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its financial and outside legal advisors, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and
including the terms and conditions of this Agreement (as it may be proposed to
be amended by Union or StellarOne, as applicable) (A) is more favorable to the
stockholders of Union or StellarOne, as the case may be, from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(as it may be proposed to be amended by Union or StellarOne, as applicable)
and (B) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed;
provided that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the
Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section
5.5(c), except the reference to "10% or more" in such definition shall be
deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall
only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving StellarOne or Union or one
of their respective banking Subsidiaries.

 

(e) Except as provided in Section 5.5(f), neither the Board of Directors of
StellarOne, the Board of Directors of Union, nor, in each case, any committee
thereof shall withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the other
party, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner
adverse to the other party, the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Board of Directors of StellarOne or Union, as applicable,
or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (a "Change in StellarOne Recommendation" or
a "Change in Union Recommendation," respectively).

 



33 (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of StellarOne or Union, as
applicable, may either:

(i) enter into a definitive agreement to accept a Superior Proposal and
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(j) or (k), as the case may
be, provided that such party shall pay the Termination Fee required to be paid
pursuant to Section 7.4(b) or (d), as the case may be, or

(ii) make a Change in StellarOne Recommendation or a Change in
Union Recommendation, as applicable,

if and only if in the case of both clause (i) and (ii) above (A) an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from
a breach of this Section 5.5) is made to StellarOne or Union, as applicable,
by a third party, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, (B) the
Board of Directors of StellarOne or Union, as applicable, has concluded in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C)
the Board of Directors of StellarOne or Union, as applicable, have concluded
in good faith (after consultation with their outside legal counsel) that
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable law, (D) five (5)
business days shall have elapsed since the party proposing to take such action
has given written notice to the other party advising such other party that the
notifying party intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable
detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action (a "Notice of
Termination or Recommendation Change") (it being understood that
any amendment to any material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require
a new Notice of Termination or Recommendation Change, except that, in such
case, the five (5) business day period referred to in this clause (D) and in
clauses (E) and (F) shall be reduced to three (3) business days following the
giving of such new Notice of Termination or Recommendation Change), (E) during
such five (5) business day period, the notifying party has considered and, at
the reasonable request of the other party, engaged in good faith discussions
with such party regarding, any adjustment or modification of the terms of this
Agreement proposed by the other party, and (F) the board of directors of the
party proposing to take such action, following such five (5) business day
period, again reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the
other party) that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action is
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties to its
stockholders under applicable law.

 



34 ---|---|--- 
 

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
to prepare as promptly as possible all documentation, to effect all filings

Approvals") and will make all necessary filings in respect of the Regulatory
Approvals as soon as practicable.

(b) Each party hereto will promptly furnish to the other party copies of
applications filed with all Regulatory Agencies or Governmental Authorities
and copies of written communications received by such party from any
Regulatory Agency or Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each party will consult with the other party with respect
to the obtaining of all Regulatory Approvals and other material consents
from third parties advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and each party will keep the other party apprised of the
status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby. All documents that the parties or their respective
Subsidiaries are responsible for filing with any Regulatory Agency or
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(including to obtain Regulatory Approvals) will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of applicable law.



     | 5.7 | Public Announcements. 
---|---|--- 
 

Prior to the Effective Date, the parties hereto will consult with each other
as to the form and substance of any press release or other public statement
materially related to this Agreement prior to issuing such press release or
public statement or making any other public disclosure related thereto
(including any broad based employee communication that is reasonably likely to
become the subject of public disclosure); provided, that nothing in this
Section 5.7 shall prohibit any party from making any disclosure necessary in
order to satisfy such partyÂ’s disclosure obligations imposed by applicable law
or the rules established by the NASDAQ Global Select Market or any other
self-regulatory organization.



     | 5.8 | Affiliate Agreements. 
---|---|--- 
 

Union has identified to StellarOne all persons who are, as of the date hereof,
directors or executive officers of Union (the "Union Affiliates"), and
StellarOne has identified to Union all persons who are, as of the date hereof,
directors or executive officers of StellarOne (the "StellarOne Affiliates").
Each party will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a written agreement
in the form of Exhibit 5.8 hereto to be delivered, on or prior to the date
hereof to StellarOne from each Union Affiliate and to Union from each
StellarOne Affiliate, on or prior to the date hereof.

 



35 ---|---|--- 
 

(a) On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date, the
Continuing Corporation shall provide to officers and employees of StellarOne
and its Subsidiaries, who at or after the Effective Date become employees of
the Continuing Corporation or its Subsidiaries ("StellarOne Continuing
Employees"), employee benefits under Benefit Plans maintained by the
Continuing Corporation, on terms and conditions which are the same as for
similarly situated officers and employees of the Continuing Corporation and
its Subsidiaries. Until such time as the StellarOne Continuing Employees are
able to participate in the Benefit Plans of the Continuing Corporation, the
Continuing Corporation shall maintain for the benefit of the StellarOne
Continuing Employees the Benefit Plans maintained by StellarOne immediately
prior to the Effective Date (it being understood that participation in the
Continuing CorporationÂ’s Benefit Plans may commence at different times with
respect to each Benefit Plan).

(b) For purposes of participation, vesting and benefit accrual (but only for
benefit accrual for vacation or paid time off) under the Continuing
CorporationÂ’s Benefit Plans, service with or credited by StellarOne or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be treated as service with the Continuing Corporation;
provided that this provision shall not cause UnionÂ’s tax-qualified defined
benefit pension plan (which is not open to new participants) to be opened to
new participants or to provide additional credit for pre-Effective Date
service for benefit accrual purposes. Immediately following the Effective
Date, a StellarOne Continuing Employee shall begin participation in the
Continuing CorporationÂ’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan, provided such
StellarOne Continuing Employee meets any applicable age and service
requirements on the Effective Date (based on the granting of StellarOne
service credit). To the extent permitted under applicable law, the Continuing
Corporation shall cause welfare Benefit Plans maintained by the Continuing
Corporation that cover the StellarOne Continuing Employees after the Effective
Date to (i) waive any waiting period and restrictions and limitations for
preexisting conditions or insurability (except for pre-existing conditions
that were excluded, or restrictions or limitations that were applicable, under
the Benefit Plans maintained by StellarOne), and (ii) cause any deductible,
co-insurance, flexible spending account contribution or maximum out-of-pocket
payments made by the StellarOne Continuing Employees under welfare Benefit
Plans maintained by StellarOne to be credited to such StellarOne
Continuing Employees under welfare Benefit Plans maintained by the Continuing
Corporation, so as to reduce the amount of any deductible, co-insurance, or
maximum out-of-pocket payments payable by, and provide credit for any flexible
spending account contributions already made by, such StellarOne Continuing
Employees under welfare Benefit Plans maintained by the Continuing
Corporation. Any paid time off amount with respect to each StellarOne
Continuing Employee that is accrued and outstanding as of the Effective Date
shall be carried over or cashed out by the Continuing Corporation in its sole
discretion at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date,
as the case may be, subject to a carry-over limit of five (5) days. 

(c) Each employee of StellarOne, or one of its Subsidiaries, at the Effective
Date who is terminated by the Continuing Corporation, or one of its
Subsidiaries, on or after the Effective Date, excluding any employee who has a
contract providing for severance (who shall be entitled to the severance
amounts provided for in their respective contracts), shall be entitled to
severance pay in accordance with the severance policy of

 



36  StellarOne as in effect on the date of this Agreement, if and to the extent
that such employee is entitled to severance pay under such policy. Each
employee of StellarOne, or one of its Subsidiaries, who is terminated by the
Continuing Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (other than for cause) on or
within six (6) months of the Effective Date, shall be entitled to reasonable
outplacement services to be provided by an outplacement agency selected by
the Continuing Corporation at no cost to the employee. The scope and duration
of outplacement services offered will vary based on an employeeÂ’s position and
exemption status at StellarOne immediately prior to the Effective Date.

(d) With respect to StellarOneÂ’s 401(k) plan, StellarOne shall cause such plan
to be fully vested and terminated effective immediately prior to the
Effective Date, in accordance with applicable law and subject to the receipt
of all applicable regulatory or governmental approvals. Each StellarOne
Continuing Employee who is a participant in the StellarOne 401(k) plan shall
be eligible to participate in UnionÂ’s 401(k) plan as soon as administratively
practical after the Effective Date, and account balances under the terminated
StellarOne 401(k) plan will be eligible for distribution or rollover,
including direct rollover of both cash and promissory notes to UnionÂ’s 401(k)
plan for the StellarOne Continuing Employees. Any other former employee of
StellarOne or its Subsidiaries who is employed by Union or its Subsidiaries
after the Effective Date shall be eligible to be a participant in UnionÂ’s
401(k) plan upon complying with eligibility requirements. For purposes of
administering UnionÂ’s 401(k) plan, service with StellarOne and its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be service with Union for participation and
vesting purposes, but not for purposes of benefit accrual.

(e) Except as provided in this Section 5.9(e), nothing in this Section 5.9
shall be construed to limit the right of the Continuing Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Date, to amend or terminate any
of the Benefit Plans maintained by Union or StellarOne or their respective
Subsidiaries before the Effective Date to the extent such amendment or
termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan, provided
that such amendment or termination shall not relieve the Continuing
Corporation from its obligations under this Section 5.9.



     | 5.10 | Reservation of Shares; NASDAQ Listing. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Union shall take all corporate action as may be necessary to authorize and
reserve for issuance such number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement, including proposing at the
Union Stockholders Meeting that stockholders approve an amendment to UnionÂ’s
Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Union
Common Stock as described in Section 1.3(a), and to cause all such shares,
when issued pursuant to this Agreement, to be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable.

(b) Union shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of the
Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved
for listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, subject to official notice of
issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in any event before the Effective
Date.

 



37 ---|---|--- 

(a) Following the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
any person who has rights to indemnification from StellarOne or any of its
Subsidiaries (an "Indemnified Party") (in all capacities), to the same extent
and on the same conditions as such person was entitled to indemnification
pursuant to applicable law and StellarOneÂ’s Organizational Documents or any
StellarOne SubsidiaryÂ’s Organizational Documents, as the case may be, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement (including advancing expenses when
requested). Without limiting the foregoing, in any case or proceeding in which
corporate approval may be required to effectuate any indemnification, the
Continuing Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary shall direct, if any
Indemnified Party elects, that the determination of permissibility of
indemnification shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon
between the Continuing Corporation or such Subsidiary and such Indemnified
Party.

(b) The Continuing Corporation shall, at or prior to the Effective Date,
purchase a six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy on the same terms and conditions
as the existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability (and fiduciary) insurance
maintained by StellarOne from insurance carriers with comparable credit
ratings, covering, without limitation, the Merger; provided, however, that the
cost of such "tail" policy shall in no event exceed three hundred percent
(300%) of the amount of the last annual premium paid by StellarOne for such
existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability (and fiduciary) insurance. If, but
for the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Continuing
Corporation would be required to expend more than three hundred percent
(300%) of current annual premiums, the Continuing Corporation will obtain the
maximum amount of that insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums
equal to three hundred percent (300%) of current annual premiums.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to
StellarOne or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.11 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her respective heirs and
legal representatives. The rights to indemnification and advancement and the
other rights provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law,
contract or otherwise.

 



     | 5.12 | Employment and Other Arrangements. 
---|---|--- 

(a) The Continuing Corporation will, as of and after the Effective Date,
assume and honor all employment agreements, change in control agreements,
severance agreements and deferred compensation plans and agreements,
including the obligations of

 



38  StellarOne to the participants in the StellarOne Executive Deferred
Compensation Plan, that StellarOne and its Subsidiaries have with current and
former officers and directors and which are set forth in Section 3.3(j) of
its Disclosure Letter, except to the extent any such agreements shall be
superseded on or after the Effective Date in a manner that complies with all
amendment and termination requirements provided for in such agreements.

(b) For purposes of all Benefit Plans sponsored or maintained by StellarOne or
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, the Merger described in this Agreement shall
be considered a "change in control" under such Benefit Plans and the rights of
StellarOne employees or Benefit Plan participants to receive any payments or
to vest in any such Benefit Plans or award agreements thereunder shall be
governed by the terms of the respective StellarOne Benefit Plans or such award
agreements.



     | 5.13 | Consent to Assign and Use Leases Premises; Extensions. 
---|---|--- 

(a) On Section 5.13 of its Disclosure Letter, StellarOne has provided a list
of all leases with respect to real or personal property used by it or any
Subsidiary. With respect to the leases disclosed in Section 5.13 of its
Disclosure Letter, StellarOne and each of its Subsidiaries will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents necessary or
appropriate to transfer and assign, as of the Effective Date, all right, title
and interest of StellarOne and each of its Subsidiaries to the Continuing
Corporation and to permit the use and operation of the leased premises by the
Continuing Corporation.

(b) At the election of Union made within forty-five (45) days after the date
hereof, with respect to any StellarOne lease that expires on or prior to June
30, 2020 without any options to extend, StellarOne and each of its
Subsidiaries shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or shall
cause to be taken, all steps reasonably requested by Union to obtain options
to extend such leases effective at the Effective Date on such terms as are
reasonably acceptable to Union.



     | 5.14 | Change of Method. 
---|---|--- 

Union and StellarOne shall be empowered, upon their mutual agreement and at
any time prior to the Effective Date, to change the method or structure of
effecting the combination of Union and StellarOne (including the provisions of
Article 1), if and to the extent they both deem such change to be necessary,
appropriate or desirable; provided that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock received by StellarOne stockholders in exchange for each share
of StellarOne Common Stock, (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of
StellarOneÂ’s stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) adversely affect
the tax treatment of StellarOne or Union pursuant to this Agreement or (iv)
materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in a timely manner. The parties hereto agree to reflect any
such change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement executed by both
parties in accordance with Section 8.3.

 



39 ---|---|--- 

If any Takeover Laws may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, each party hereto and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary and legally permissible (other than as contemplated by
Section 5.3) so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such laws or
regulations on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



     | 5.16 | Certain Policies. 
---|---|--- 

At Closing, StellarOne shall, consistent with GAAP and applicable banking
laws and regulations, modify or change its Loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, Tax,
litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan
classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that
is consistent with that of Union.



     | 5.17 | Supplemental Indenture. 
---|---|--- 
 

Prior to the Effective Date, StellarOne and Union shall take all actions
necessary for Union to enter into supplemental indentures with the trustees
of the (i) Indenture dated June 26, 2003 for StellarOneÂ’s floating rate junior
subordinated debt securities due June 26, 2033, and (ii) Indenture dated March
18, 2004 for StellarOneÂ’s floating rate junior subordinated debt securities
due June 17, 2034, to evidence the succession of Union as the obligor on those
securities as of the Effective Date. The form of the supplemental indentures
shall be reasonably acceptable to Union. Union agrees to assume StellarOneÂ’s
obligations under the above indentures and related subordinated debentures as
well as under guaranty agreements related to the preferred trust securities
issued by StellarOneÂ’s trust subsidiaries, FNB (VA) Statutory Trust II and
VFG Limited Liability Trust.



     | 5.18 | Shareholder Litigation. 
---|---|--- 
 

Each of StellarOne and Union shall give the other prompt notice of any
shareholder litigation against such party or its directors or affiliates (or
combination thereof) relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall give the other the opportunity to participate in, but not
control, the defense or settlement of any such litigation. In addition, no
such settlement by StellarOne shall be agreed to without UnionÂ’s prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).



     | 5.19 | Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). 
---|---|--- 

StellarOne and Union agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and
retain certain directors and officers of StellarOne in connection with the
Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Date, it is desirable that such
directors and officers not be subject to a risk of liability under Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act, and for that compensatory and retentive purposes
agree to the provisions of this Section 5.19. The Board of Directors of

 



40  Union and of StellarOne, or a committee of non-employee directors (as such
term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act) thereof,
shall adopt a resolution providing that the disposition of StellarOne Common
Stock, StellarOne Stock Awards or StellarOne Stock Options by such directors
and officers, and the acquisition of Continuing Corporation Common Stock,
Continuing Corporation Stock Awards or Continuing Corporation Stock Options
by such directors and officers, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, are intended to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Union and StellarOne,
respectively would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Union or
StellarOne, as applicable, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to
this Section 7.4, and, in order to obtain such payment, Union or StellarOne,
as applicable commences a suit which results in a judgment against the other
party for the fee set forth in this Section 7.4, Union or StellarOne, as
applicable, shall pay to the other party its fees and expenses
(including attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,

     | 1.1 | The Merger. 
---|---|--- 

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of June 9, 2013, by and between Union and StellarOne

to it as of the Effective Date or thereafter). The Merger shall become
effective on such date and time as may be determined in accordance with
Section 1.2 of the Agreement (the "Effective Date"). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Date, the
Continuing Corporation shall possess all rights, privileges, properties,
immunities, powers and franchises of StellarOne, and all of the debts,
liabilities, obligations, claims, restrictions and duties of StellarOne shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations, claims, restrictions and duties
of the Continuing Corporation.

ARTICLE 2

     | 2.1 | Conversion of StellarOne Common Stock. 
---|---|--- 

At the Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Union or StellarOne or their respective stockholders:

 

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of StellarOne
("StellarOne Common Stock"), that is issued and outstanding immediately
before the  Effective Date will be converted into and exchanged for 0.9739 shares of
common stock, par value $1.33 per share, of the Continuing Corporation
("Continuing Corporation Common Stock") pursuant to the terms and conditions
set forth in the Agreement and this Plan of Merger (the "Exchange Ratio").

(b) All shares of StellarOne Common Stock converted pursuant to this Section
2.1 shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Date.

 

(c) Each certificate previously representing shares of StellarOne Common Stock
(the "Old StellarOne Certificates") shall cease to represent any rights
except the right to receive with respect to each underlying share of
StellarOne Common Stock: (i) a new certificate representing the number of
whole shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which the shares
of StellarOne Common Stock represented by the Old StellarOne Certificate have
been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1 upon the surrender of such Old
StellarOne Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, (ii) in accordance
with Section 2.3, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock; and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5.

 

(d) Each share of Union Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before
the Effective Date shall remain an issued and outstanding share of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock. Each certificate previously representing shares of
Union Common Stock shall continue to represent an equal number of shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock on and after the Effective Date. 

(e) Each share of StellarOne Common Stock held by either party and each share
of Union Common Stock held by StellarOne or any of its Subsidiaries (as
defined herein) prior to the Effective Date (in each case other than in a
fiduciary or agency capacity or on behalf of third parties as a result of
debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist at the Effective Date and no consideration shall be issued in
exchange therefor; provided, that such shares of Union Common Stock shall
resume the status of authorized and unissued shares of Union Common Stock.

 



     | 2.2 | Exchange Procedures. 
---|---|--- 

(a) At the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with its transfer agent or such other transfer agent or
depository or trust institution of recognized standing approved by Union (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of the Old StellarOne
Certificates, certificates representing Continuing Corporation Common Stock
("New Certificates"), together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto and any cash to be paid hereunder in lieu of fractional
shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock, without any interest thereon
(the "Exchange Fund"), to be paid pursuant to Article 1 and this Article 2 in
exchange for outstanding shares of StellarOne Common Stock.

 



2 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, and in no event later
than five (5) business days thereafter, the Continuing Corporation shall
cause the Exchange Agent to send to each former stockholder of record of
StellarOne immediately before the Effective Date transmittal materials for use
in exchanging such stockholderÂ’s Old StellarOne Certificates for New
Certificates based upon the Exchange Ratio.

(c) The Continuing Corporation shall cause the New Certificates for shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which shares of StellarOne Common
Stock are converted at the Effective Date or dividends or distributions which
such stockholder shall be entitled to receive and any cash to be paid in lieu
of fractional shares to be paid to such stockholder upon delivery to the
Exchange Agent of Old StellarOne Certificates, together with the transmittal
materials duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto. No interest will accrue or be paid on any such cash to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 2.5.

(d) A StellarOne stockholder whose Old StellarOne Certificates have been lost,
destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing shall be entitled to receive New
Certificates, dividends or distributions, and cash in lieu of fractional
shares, to which such stockholder shall be entitled upon compliance with
reasonable conditions imposed by Union pursuant to applicable law and as
required in accordance with UnionÂ’s standard policy (including
the requirement that the shareholder furnish a surety bond or other customary
indemnity).

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of StellarOne for twelve (12) months after the Effective Date
shall be returned to the Continuing Corporation (together with any dividends
or earnings in respect thereof). Any former stockholders of StellarOne who
have not complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter be entitled to look
only to the Continuing Corporation, and only as a general creditor thereof,
for payment of the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of
StellarOne Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, without any interest thereon.

(f) None of the Exchange Agent, either of the parties hereto or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be liable to any stockholder of StellarOne for
any amount of property delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



     | 2.3 | No Fractional Shares. 
---|---|--- 
 

Each holder of shares of StellarOne Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common
Stock multiplied by the closing sale price of Union Common Stock on the
NASDAQ Global Select Market for the trading day immediately preceding the
Effective Date.

 



3 ---|---|--- 

In the event Union changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the
number of shares of Union Common Stock issued and outstanding before the
Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, appropriate and
proportional adjustments will be made to the Exchange Ratio.



     | 2.5 | Dividends. 
---|---|--- 

No dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of
StellarOne Common Stock at, or as of, any time after the Effective Date will
be paid to the holder of any Old StellarOne Certificates until such holder
physically surrenders such certificate (or furnishes a surety bond of a
customary indemnity that such certificate is lost, destroyed, stolen or are
otherwise missing) for exchange as provided in Section 2.2 of this Agreement,
promptly after which time all such dividends or distributions will be paid
(without interest).



     | 2.6 | StellarOne Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards. 
---|---|--- 

(a) At the Effective Date, each option to purchase shares of StellarOne Common
Stock (a "StellarOne Stock Option") granted under an equity or equity-based
compensation plan of StellarOne (a "StellarOne Stock Plan"), shall vest and
shall be converted into an option (each, a "Replacement Option") to acquire,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such StellarOne
Stock Option (except as provided otherwise in this Section 2.6(a)), the
number of shares of Union Common Stock equal to (i) the number of shares of
StellarOne Common Stock subject to the StellarOne Stock Option multiplied by
(ii) the Exchange Ratio. Such product shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole number. The exercise price per share (rounded up to the next whole cent)
of each Replacement Option shall equal (y) the exercise price per share of
shares of StellarOne Common Stock that were purchasable pursuant to such
StellarOne Stock Option divided by (z) the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each StellarOne Stock Option that is intended to be an "incentive
stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code")) shall be adjusted in accordance with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code and all other options shall be
adjusted in a manner that maintains the options exemption from Section 409A
of the Code. At the Effective Date, Union shall assume the StellarOne Stock
Plans; provided that such assumption shall only be with respect to the
Replacement Options and the StellarOne Stock Awards (as defined herein) and
shall have no obligation to make any additional grants or awards under the
StellarOne Stock Plans.

(b) Each restricted stock award granted under a StellarOne Stock Plan (a
"StellarOne Stock Award") which is unvested or contingent and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Date, shall cease, at the Effective Date,
to represent any rights with respect to shares of StellarOne Common Stock and
shall be converted without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into
a restricted stock award of the Continuing Corporation (a "Continuing
Corporation Stock Award"), on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the StellarOne Stock Awards (but taking into account any

 



4  changes thereto, including any acceleration of vesting thereof, provided for
in the StellarOne Stock Plan or in the related award document by reason of the
Merger). The number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject
to each such Continuing Corporation Stock Award shall be equal to the number
of shares of StellarOne Common Stock subject to the StellarOne Stock Award
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole
share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock.



     | 2.7 | Treasury Warrant. 
---|---|--- 

At the Effective Date, each warrant to purchase StellarOne Common Stock
originally issued to the United States Department of the Treasury (the
"Treasury") pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement incorporated into
the Letter Agreement, dated December 19, 2008, between StellarOne and the
Treasury (a "Treasury Warrant"), which is then outstanding and unexercised
shall cease to represent a right to acquire StellarOne Common Stock and shall
be converted into a warrant to purchase shares of Union Common Stock in an
amount and at an exercise price determined in accordance with the terms of
such Treasury Warrant.



     | 2.8 | Withholding Rights. 
---|---|--- 

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such
amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax (as defined in the Agreement) law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority (as defined
in the Agreement) by the Exchange Agent, such amounts withheld will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange
Agent.

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Union and StellarOne have approved a
business combination of their companies through the merger (the "Merger") of
StellarOne with and into Union pursuant to the terms and conditions of an

WHEREAS, the Stockholder is the beneficial and registered owner of, and has
the sole power to vote or direct the disposition of the number of shares of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of StellarOne ("StellarOne Common
Stock") set forth opposite the StockholderÂ’s name on  _Schedule A_ hereto
(such shares, together with all shares of StellarOne Common Stock subsequently
acquired by the Stockholder during the term of this Agreement, are referred to

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Union and StellarOne entering into
the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder has agreed to enter into and perform
this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, representations, warranties
and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, and other good
and valuable consideration (including the merger consideration set forth in
Article 2 of the Merger Agreement), the receipt and sufficiency of which are
acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree
as follows:



     | 1 _._  | __Agreement to Vote. 
---|---|--- 

During the term of this Agreement and at such time as StellarOne conducts the
StellarOne Stockholders Meeting, the Stockholder agrees to vote or cause to be
voted all of the Shares, and to cause any holder of record of the Shares to
vote all such Shares, in person or by proxy: (i) in favor of the Merger
Agreement at the StellarOne Stockholders Meeting; and (ii) against (A) any
Acquisition Proposal, (B) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement
which could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of StellarOne
under the Merger Agreement or of the Stockholder under this Agreement and (C)
any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that  could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage,

     | 2. | Covenants of Stockholder. 
---|---|--- 
 

The Stockholder covenants and agrees as follows:

(a) _Ownership._ The Stockholder is the beneficial and registered owner of the
Shares as set forth opposite the StockholderÂ’s name on _Schedule A_ hereto.
Except for the StockholderÂ’s Shares, the Stockholder is not the beneficial or
registered owner of any other shares of StellarOne Common Stock or rights to
acquire shares of StellarOne Common Stock and for which Stockholder has sole
right and power to vote and/or dispose. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "beneficial ownership" shall be interpreted in accordance with Rule 13d-3
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

(b) _Restrictions on Transfer._ During the term of this Agreement, the
Stockholder will not sell, pledge, hypothecate, grant a security interest in,
transfer or otherwise dispose of or encumber any of the Shares and will not
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than a proxy for
the purpose of voting the StockholderÂ’s Shares in accordance with Section 1
hereof) which would during that term (i) restrict, (ii) establish a right of
first refusal to, or (iii) otherwise relate to, the transfer or voting of the
Shares.

(c)  _Authority._ The Stockholder has full power, authority and legal
capacity to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform
fully the StockholderÂ’s obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Stockholder and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable against
the Stockholder in accordance with its terms.

(d) _No Breach._ None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation by the Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will
result in a violation of, or a default under, or conflict with, any contract,
loan and credit arrangements, Liens (as defined in Section 2(e) below), trust,
commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or restriction of any kind
to which the Stockholder is a party or bound or to which the Shares are
subject.

(e) _No Liens._ The Shares and the certificates representing the Shares are
now, and at all times during the term of this Agreement, will be, held by the
Stockholder, or by a nominee or custodian for the benefit of the Stockholder,
free and clear of all pledges, liens, security interests, claims, proxies,
voting trusts or agreements, understandings or arrangements or any other
encumbrances whatsoever (each, a "Lien"), except for (i) any Liens arising
hereunder, and (ii) Liens, if any, which have been disclosed on _Schedule B_
attached hereto. 

(f) _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Stockholder does not, and the performance by the Stockholder of his or
her obligations under this Agreement and the consummation by him or her of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, require the Stockholder to obtain
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to make any filing with
or notification to, any Governmental Authority.

 



2 (g) _Absence of Litigation_. There is no suit, action, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Stockholder, threatened
against or affecting the Stockholder or any of his or her affiliates before or
by any Governmental Authority that could reasonably be expected to materially
impair the ability of the Stockholder to perform his or her obligations
hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

(h) _No Solicitation_. During the term of this Agreement, the Stockholder
shall not, nor shall he or she permit any investment banker, attorney or other
adviser or representative of the Stockholder to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
any person any information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal.

(i)  _Statements_. The Stockholder shall not make any statement, written or
oral, to the effect that he or she does not support the Merger or that other
stockholders of StellarOne should not support the Merger.

 



     | 3. | No Prior Proxies. 
---|---|--- 

The Stockholder represents, warrants and covenants that any proxies or voting
rights previously given in respect of the Shares are revocable, and that any
such proxies or voting rights are hereby irrevocably revoked.

 



     | 4. | Certain Events. 
---|---|--- 

The Stockholder agrees that this Agreement and the obligations hereunder
shall attach to the Shares and shall be binding upon any person or entity to
which legal or beneficial ownership of the Shares shall pass, whether by
operation of law or otherwise, including the StockholderÂ’s successors or
assigns. In the event of any stock split, stock dividend, merger, exchange,
reorganization, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of
StellarOne affecting the Shares, the number of Shares subject to the terms of
this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted, and this Agreement and the
obligations hereunder shall attach to any additional securities of StellarOne
issued to or acquired by the Stockholder.

 



     | 5. | Capacity; Obligation to Vote. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that the Board of Directors of StellarOne is permitted to engage in
negotiations or discussions with any person who made an unsolicited _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 5.5 of the
Merger Agreement, the Stockholder shall be permitted, at the request of the
Board of Directors of StellarOne, to respond to inquiries from, and discuss
such Acquisition Proposal with, the Board of Directors of StellarOne. With
respect to the terms of this Agreement

 



3  relating to the Shares, this Agreement relates solely to the capacity of the
Stockholder as a stockholder or other beneficial owner of the Shares and is
not in any way intended to affect or prevent the exercise by the Stockholder
of his or her responsibilities as a director or officer of StellarOne,
including actions permitted to be taken in compliance with Section 5.5 of the
Merger Agreement. The term "Shares" shall not include any securities
beneficially owned by the Stockholder as a trustee or fiduciary, and this
Agreement is not in any way intended to affect the exercise by the Stockholder
of his or her fiduciary responsibility in respect of any such securities. 

(b) The parties hereto agree that, notwithstanding the provisions contained in
Section 1 hereof, the Stockholder shall not be obligated to vote as required
in Section 1 of this Agreement in the event that (i) Union is in material
default with respect to any covenant, representation, warranty or agreement
with respect to it contained in the Merger Agreement, or (ii) StellarOne is
otherwise entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement.



     | 6. | Term; Termination. 
---|---|--- 

The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof. This Agreement
shall terminate upon the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with Article 7 of the Merger Agreement. Other than as provided for herein,
following the termination of this Agreement, there shall be no further
liabilities or obligations hereunder on the part of the Stockholder,
StellarOne or Union, or their respective officers or directors, except that
nothing in this Section 6 shall relieve any party hereto from any liability
for breach of this Agreement before such termination.



     | 7. | Stop Transfer Order. 
---|---|--- 

In furtherance of this Agreement, as soon as practicable after the date
hereof, the Stockholder shall hereby authorize and instruct StellarOne to
instruct its transfer agent to enter a stop transfer order with respect to all
of Shares for the period from the date hereof through the date this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with Section 6 hereof.



     | 8. | Specific Performance. 
---|---|--- 
 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the applicable
party hereto in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity. Each party hereto
waives the posting of any bond or security in connection with any proceeding
related thereto.



     | 9. | Amendments. 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented except
by execution and delivery of a written agreement by the parties hereto.

 



4 ---|---|---

shall be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective personal
representatives, successors and assigns, except that the parties hereto may
not transfer or assign any of their respective rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of the other parties.

(b) The parties hereto agree and designate StellarOne Bank and Union First
Market Bank as third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, with StellarOne

---|---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties in separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to
be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



     | 14. | Severability. 
---|---|--- 

In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable any other provisions hereof. Any provision

of his or her fiduciary responsibility in respect of any such securities.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that, notwithstanding the provisions contained in
Section 1 hereof, the Stockholder shall not be obligated to vote as required

following the termination of this Agreement, there shall be no further
liabilities or obligations hereunder on the part of the Stockholder, Union or
StellarOne, or their respective officers or directors, except that nothing in
this Section 6 shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for breach
of this Agreement before such termination.



     | 7. | Stop Transfer Order. 
---|---|--- 

In furtherance of this Agreement, as soon as practicable after the date

Shares for the period from the date hereof through the date this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 6 hereof.



     | 8. | Specific Performance.

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the applicable
party hereto in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity. Each party hereto
waives the posting of any bond or security in connection with any proceeding
related thereto.

---|---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties in separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to
be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



     | 14. | Severability. 
---|---|--- 

In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable any other provisions hereof. Any provision
of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall
