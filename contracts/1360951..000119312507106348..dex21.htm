11  without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
automatically into the right to receive, in cash without interest, $62.50
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of the Certificate
representing such Shares as provided in _Article III_. All Shares, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be retired

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become

accordance with its terms and as provided by Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, pursuant to the Merger, the bylaws of Merger Sub

of the Company, unless otherwise specified by Parent, to be effective at the

continue in office as the directors of the Surviving Corporation and the
officers of the Company shall continue in office as the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, and such directors and officers shall hold office

with and subject to applicable Law and the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.7 _Company Stock Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder, each then-outstanding Company Stock Option shall be
canceled, and, in the case  



 

12  of (x) a Company Stock Option having a per share exercise price less than
the sum of (i) the Merger Consideration plus (ii) the Special Dividend,
converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount
(subject to any applicable withholding tax and payable without interest) in
cash equal to the product of (A) the number of Company Common Shares subject
to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B)
the amount by which the sum of (i) the Merger Consideration plus (ii) the
Special Dividend exceeds the per share exercise price of such Company Stock
Option, or (y) a Company Stock Option having a per share exercise price equal
to or greater than the sum of (i) the Merger Consideration plus (ii) the
Special Dividend, without the payment of cash or issuance of other securities
in respect thereof. The cancellation of a Company Stock Option as provided in
the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed a release of any and all
rights the holder thereof had or may have had in respect of such Company Stock
Option.

(b) Subject to _Section 3.7_, all payments with respect to canceled Company
Stock Options shall be made by the Paying Agent (and Parent shall cause
Paying Agent to make such payments) as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time from the Exchange Fund. Such payments shall be
accompanied by a letter from the Paying Agent explaining how the payment
amounts with respect to the canceled Company Stock Options were determined.

(c) Except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, (i) each Company Incentive
Plan (together with any target equity opportunities established or
contingently established thereunder, which shall become void _ab initio_ )
shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan,
program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof shall be canceled as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall
ensure that following the Effective Time no participant in the Company
Incentive Plans or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have any right
thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof.

Section 2.8 _Restricted Stock_. If any Company Common Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time is not then vested under any stock
option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of the Company, or
otherwise (" _Company Restricted Shares_ "), then, there shall be substituted
for each such Company Restricted Share a long-term incentive cash award (a "
_Cash Unit_ ") in the amount of the Merger Consideration, which shall vest or
be forfeited in accordance with the vesting and forfeiture provisions
governing such Company Restricted Share (as such provisions exist immediately
prior to the Effective Time) and shall be paid to the holder of such award,
immediately upon vesting. The Company shall take such actions as may be
necessary to provide for the substitution of such long term incentive cash
awards for the Company Restricted Shares in accordance with the documents
governing Company Restricted Shares. Immediately after the Effective Time,
Parent shall create an interest-bearing "Escrow Fund" by depositing with an
escrow agent mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent (the " _Escrow
Agent_ "), pursuant to an escrow agreement mutually agreeable to the Company
and Parent, cash in the aggregate amount equal to the Merger Consideration
which would have been payable with respect to the Company Restricted Shares,
if their restrictions had lapsed and they had vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Subject to _Section 3.7_, upon the vesting of a Cash Unit in
accordance with the first sentence of this  _Section 2.8_, the cash in
escrow in respect thereof shall immediately be paid (together with accrued and



 

13  unpaid interest) to the holder of the Company Restricted Share for which it
was substituted, net of fees payable or paid to the escrow agent and
taxes payable, paid or withheld. Upon the forfeiture of a Cash Unit in
accordance with the first sentence of this _Section 2.8_, it shall
immediately be paid (together with accrued and unpaid interest) to Parent, net
of fees payable or paid to the escrow agent and taxes payable, paid or
withheld.

Section 2.9 _Company ESPP_. The Company shall take any and all actions with
respect to the Company ESPP as are necessary to provide that: (i) with respect
to the Offering Period (as defined in the Company ESPP) in effect as of the
date hereof, no employee who is not a participant in the Company ESPP as of
the date hereof may become after the date hereof a participant in the Company
ESPP and no participant in the Company ESPP may increase the percentage amount
of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect on the date
hereof for such Offering Period; (ii) subject to consummation of the Merger,
the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately before the Effective
Time (the " _Company ESPP Termination Date_ "); and (iii) if the Offering
Period in effect as of the date hereof terminates prior to the Company ESPP
Termination Date, the Company ESPP shall be suspended and no new Offering
Period will be commenced under the Company ESPP unless this Agreement shall
have terminated prior to the consummation of the Merger. If such Offering
Period is still in effect on the Company ESPP Termination Date, then, on the
Company ESPP Termination Date, each purchase right under the Company ESPP as
of the Company ESPP Termination Date shall be automatically exercised by
applying the payroll deductions of each participant in the Company ESPP for
such Offering Period to the purchase of a number of whole Shares (subject to
the provisions of the Company ESPP regarding the number of shares purchasable)
at an exercise price per Share equal to the lower of (A) 85% of the Fair
Market Value (as defined in the Company ESPP) of a Company Common Share at the
start of the Offering Period and (B) 85% of the Merger Consideration, which
number of shares will then be canceled and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.4_ hereof. Any
excess payroll deductions not used as a result of share limitations under the
Company ESPP shall be distributed to each participant without interest. If a
fractional number of Shares results, then such number shall be rounded down to
the next whole number, and the excess payroll deductions shall be distributed
to the applicable participant without interest. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay to each participant in the Company ESPP entitled to payment in accordance
with this _Section 2.9_ the amounts payable with respect thereto.

Section 2.10 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Subject to the restrictions
contained in  _Section 6.1_, in the event that the Company changes the
number of Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect such change.

ARTICLE III

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 3.1 _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
the Paying Agent to act as paying agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of the



 

14  Certificates pursuant to this _Article III_. Immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in the aggregate amount
required to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares plus cash to
pay for (i) Company Stock Options pursuant to _Section 2.7_, and (ii) amounts
with respect to the Company ESPP pursuant to  _Section 2.9_ (such cash
amounts being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange
Fund shall be used solely for purposes of paying the Merger Consideration and
amounts with respect to Company Stock Options, and the Company ESPP in
accordance with this Article III and shall not be used to satisfy any other
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to the Company Restricted Shares. Pending distribution
of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this _Article III_ , Parent may direct
the Paying Agent to invest such cash, _provided that_ such investments (i)
shall be obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America,
commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys
Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of domestic
commercial banks with capital exceeding $500,000,000 (collectively "
_Permitted Investments_ ") or money market funds that are invested solely in
Permitted Investments and (ii) shall have maturities that will not prevent or
delay payments to be made pursuant to this _Article III_. Any income from
investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable solely to Parent.

Section 3.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Shares
subsequently converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as
set forth in _Section 2.4_: (i) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") that (A) shall specify that delivery shall be effected and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent (or an affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof, together with any bond or indemnity agreement, as contemplated
by _Section 3.6_) and (B) shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify; and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. 

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and executed, and any
other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, (i) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a check representing the applicable amount of cash
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and (ii)
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each such
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger
Consideration.

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate amount of the
Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent properly endorsed or
accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying
Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable
Taxes have been paid.



 

15 Section 3.3 _No Further Ownership Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon
the surrender for exchange of the Certificates representing Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares and, after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

Section 3.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the former Company Shareholders on the date twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand, and any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore received
any applicable Merger Consideration to which such Company Stockholder is
entitled under this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of
claims with respect thereto and only as a general creditor thereof.

Section 3.5 _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
Merger Sub shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any part of the Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any such Shares at such date as is immediately prior
to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law or Order, become the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or
personal representatives previously entitled thereto. 

Section 3.6 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, or the execution and
delivery by such Person of an indemnity agreement in such form as Parent or
the Surviving Corporation may direct, in each case as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration.

Section 3.7 _Withholding of Tax_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, the
Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares
(including Company Restricted Shares and Cash Units substituted therefor)
or Company Stock Options, and any participant in the Company ESPP, such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, the
Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment  



 

16  under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, any
Affiliate thereof, Parent, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be (a) paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity
in accordance with applicable Law or Order and (b) treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder or participant, as the case
may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, Parent, the Paying Agent or the
Escrow Agent, as the case may be. 

ARTICLE IV

Disclosure Letter delivered by the Company to Parent concurrently with the

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation or other
legal entity, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect,
(ii) has full corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to conduct its business as presently
conducted, except where any failure to have such power or

Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each

Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The copies of the Company Articles of Incorporation and Company Bylaws
that are incorporated by reference into the Company 10-K are complete and
correct copies thereof as in effect on the date hereof. The Company is not in

of the FBCA to the extent, if any, such Sections would otherwise be applicable
to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

combination, fair price or other anti-takeover Law applies to this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Company and the Company Board have taken all necessary action to ensure

furnish to Parent and its Representatives such financial and operating data
and other information (including such environmental investigation, study,
audit, test, review or other analysis or legal analysis in relation thereto)
as such Persons may reasonably request subject, however, to restrictions that
may be required under Antitrust Laws upon the written advice of counsel.

(b) Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold, and shall cause
their respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other Representatives to hold, all information received, directly
or indirectly, from the Company or its Representatives in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) No investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to
such party pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective,
in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, including (i)
obtaining all necessary, proper or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents, qualifications and approvals from Governmental Entities and making

necessary, proper or advisable consents, qualifications, approvals, waivers or
exemptions from non-governmental Third Parties; and (iii) executing and
delivering any additional documents or instruments necessary, proper or

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, (i) to the extent applicable, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof
and any other required submissions under the HSR Act which the Company or
Parent determines should be made, in each case with respect to the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions necessary
to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act as soon as practicable and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cooperate with one another (A) in promptly determining whether
any filings are required to be or should be made or consents, approvals,
permits or authorizations are required to be or should be obtained under any
other federal, state or foreign Law or regulation or whether any consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be or should be obtained from other
parties to loan agreements or other contracts or instruments material to the
Companys business in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (B) in promptly making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain
timely any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers, and
(C) in keeping the other party reasonably informed, including by providing
the other party with a copy of any communication received by such party from,
or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other
U.S. or foreign Governmental Entity, of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 6.3_, if any objections are asserted with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any
other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of
the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law or
which would  



 

39  otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections
or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections or suits which, in
any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided however_ , that in no event shall
Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to agree, as a condition for resolving any
such matter, to dispose of or hold separate any of its properties or other
assets, or the properties or other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
after the consummation of the Merger, the aggregate fair market value of
which exceeds $20 million or to subject itself to any material restriction on
the operation of its business or the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the consummation of the Merger.

(d) In addition to and without limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall, as
soon as possible but in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the
date hereof, file with the STB the appropriate and necessary documentation for
the approval or exemption, as the case may be, of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall bear its own costs for the
preparation of such filings and responding to any inquiries or information
requests, if applicable, and Parent shall be responsible for the payment of
any applicable filing fees. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate
with one another (A) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing
information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any
such approval or exemption, and (B) in keeping the other party reasonably
informed of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, the STB, regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall permit the Company to review,
prior to filing, all documents proposed by Parent or Merger Sub to be filed
with the STB, any other Governmental Entity or any court to secure approval
or exemption of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other (such party, the " _Notifying Party_ "), shall promptly (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days after becoming aware of any such breach)
notify the other party in writing if the Notifying Party believes that it has
breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement that could, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ if
continuing on the Closing Date.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 6.3_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ so long as such party has theretofore
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this _Section
6.3_.



 

40 (h) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of (i) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii)
any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to its
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to this
Agreement, or that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

Section 6.4 _Proxy Statement; Other Filings_. As promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement and each
of the Company and Parent shall, or shall cause their respective affiliates
to, prepare and, after consultation with each other, file with the SEC
all other filings with the SEC (" _Other Filings_ ") that are required to be
filed by such party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself
and its affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or,
to the extent applicable, the Other Filings, or that is customarily included
in proxy statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other, to respond
as promptly as practicable to any comments received from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, and the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Companys shareholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable following clearance from the SEC. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings and shall promptly
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, relating to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings. If at any time
prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to the
Company or Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates, officers
or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Other
Filings, so that the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings shall not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be filed promptly with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or filing the Other Filings (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response and the Company shall in good faith
consider the inclusion of such comments in the Proxy Statement.



 

41 Section 6.5 _Company Shareholders Meeting_. Unless the Company Board has
withdrawn or adversely modified the Company Recommendation (as defined below)
in accordance with _Section 6.6(c)_, the Company shall, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Company Articles of Incorporation and Company Bylaws,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting
as promptly as practicable after the date that the Proxy Statement is cleared
by the SEC, for the purpose of obtaining the Company Required Vote. Except to
the extent that the Company Board shall have withdrawn, qualified or modified
its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in compliance
with _Section 6.6(c)_, the Company Board shall recommend to holders of the
Company Common Shares that they approve this Agreement and the Merger and
shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement (the " _Company
Recommendation_ "). Subject to the first sentence of this _Section 6.5_ and
_Section 6.6(c)_, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit or cause to be solicited from its shareholders proxies in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with
Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to the extent
necessary to ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to the Company Shareholders or, if as of the time
for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Company Common Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Shareholders Meeting.

Section 6.6 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 6.6(c)_, the Company shall not, and shall
not authorize or permit, directly or indirectly, any Representative of the
Company to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage
or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information
or assistance) any inquiries with respect to, or the making of, any proposal
that constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) withdraw the Company Recommendation, or modify or amend the
Company Recommendation in any manner adverse to the Parent, or fail to make
the Company Recommendation (any event described in this clause (ii), a "
_Change in Recommendation_ "), (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
confidential information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (v)
enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, arrangement,
understanding, contract or agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
publicly propose any of the foregoing actions described in clauses (i) through
(iv). Upon execution of this Agreement and except as set forth in _Section
6.6(c)_, the Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions, negotiations or
communications with any party or parties with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and shall demand the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from waiving after the announcement of this Agreement
the applicability of any standstill provisions contained in a confidentiality
agreement between the Company and any Person which agreement was entered into
in connection with the Company Financial Advisors solicitation of potential
purchasers of the Company if (i) such Person (A) requests such waiver in
writing and (B) agrees that such waiver will be granted solely of the purpose
of making and, subject to _Section 6.6(c)_ and _Article VIII_ (as
applicable),  



 

42  negotiating and consummating an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) the Company
Board reasonably believes in its good faith judgment that the requesting
party is reasonably likely to have or be able to obtain the financial
resources to make a Superior Proposal.

(b) The Company shall promptly, and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt, notify Parent of the receipt of (i) an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any request for information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (other than requests for information unrelated to an
Acquisition Proposal) or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or
negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably likely
to constitute, an Acquisition Proposal, which any Representative for the
Company may receive. Such notification shall include, to the extent then
known, the identity of the parties and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request or, if not made in writing, a summary written description
thereof. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis
as to any material developments regarding any such proposal, indication,
inquiry or request. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall, after the
date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality agreement that would
prohibit them from providing such information to Parent, and, as of the date
of this Agreement, no such confidentiality agreements exist.

(c) Prior to the Company Shareholder Approval and subject to the Companys
compliance with the provisions of this _Section 6.6_, following the receipt
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of a written Acquisition Proposal
(including by means of a published press release or a document filed with the
SEC), the Company Board (directly or through Representatives) may (i)
furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person who made such proposal ( _provided that_ the
Company (A) has previously or concurrently furnished such information to
Parent and (B) shall furnish such information pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement which is at least as favorable to the Company as the Confidentiality
Agreement and includes a standstill provision no less restrictive to such
Person than that contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, it being
understood that such standstill provision may, in accordance with _Section
6.6(a)_, have been partially waived for the purpose of submitting and, subject
to _Section 6.6(c)_ and _Article VIII_ (as applicable), negotiating and
consummating an Acquisition Proposal; it being further understood that
_Section 6.12_ shall not apply to any Acquisition Proposal that is reasonably
likely to result in or constitutes a Superior Proposal), (ii) participate in
negotiations regarding such proposal, and (iii) following receipt of a written
Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (x) recommend that
the Companys shareholders approve such Superior Proposal and, in connection
therewith, effect a Change in Recommendation and (y) authorize the Company to
enter into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of such
Superior Proposal if in the case of either (x) or (y) the Company Board
determines in good faith following consultation with its legal and financial
advisors that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take the applicable actions set
forth in this clause (iii) would be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
agreement may be entered into unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated by the Company in accordance with _Section 8.1(h)_. Nothing
in this _Section 6.6_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company Board from (i) at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval and other than in response to an Acquisition Proposal,
effecting a Change in Recommendation in the event that the Company Board has
determined in good faith that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its duties  



 

43  to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, or (ii) taking and
disclosing to the Company shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or from making any required disclosure to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Law, including, without limitation, Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board shall
be permitted to recommend that the Company shareholders tender any securities
in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve,
endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or withdraw or modify the
Company Recommendation, unless in each case such tender or exchange offer
constitutes a Superior Proposal and, in connection therewith, effects a
Change in Recommendation in accordance with this _Section 6.6_. In addition,
nothing in this _Section 6.6(c)_ shall prohibit the Company from taking any
action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take.

Section 6.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements (including scheduling a press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts) with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the
prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such
public statement as may be required by Law or Order, the applicable rules of
the New York Stock Exchange or any listing agreement with the New York Stock
Exchange.

Section 6.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor and provide for payment of all obligations and benefits
under all Company Benefit Plans set forth, and identified as such, in the
Company Disclosure Letter (including, without limitation, employment or
severance agreements between the Company and Persons who are or had been
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time), all in accordance with their respective terms.

(b) If Company Employees are included in any Parent Benefit Plan following the
Effective Time, such Company Employees shall receive credit for past service
with the Company for purposes of accrual of vacation time and sick leave and,
to extent practicable and permitted under applicable benefit plans, for
purposes of eligibility for participation, vesting and benefit accruals (but
not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan)
under Parent Benefit Plans.

(c) If Company Employees are included in any Parent Benefit Plan following
the Effective Time, all actively-at-work or similar limitations, eligibility
waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any Parent
Benefit Plan that is a group health plan shall be waived with respect to such
Company Employees and their eligible dependents, in each case, to the same
extent as service with the Company or its Subsidiaries was taken into account
under the comparable Company Benefit Plan, and credit shall be provided for
any co-payments, deductibles and offsets (or similar payments) made under
Company Benefit Plans for the  



 

44  applicable plan year prior to the Effective Time for purposes of satisfying
any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under any
Parent Benefit Plans in which they become eligible to participate after the
Effective Time.

(d) Except as otherwise provided for in this  _Section 6.8_, nothing herein
shall prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating
any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms.

(e) No provision of this _Section 6.8_ shall create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any current, former or retired employee,
officer, consultant, independent contractor or director (including any heir,
executor, administrator, representative, beneficiary or dependent thereof).
Nothing contained herein shall prevent Parent from terminating the employment
of any Company Employee or terminating, or amending the terms of, any Company
Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate
committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition
by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of
the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Company Common Shares or options
or other rights to acquire Company Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement
and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

(g) Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall create a retention plan
(the " _Retention Plan_ ") for the employees listed in _Section 6.8(g)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter with their respective potential retention
amounts (" _Retention Amounts_ "). If a listed employee continues to be
employed by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, performing the duties
described in the employees employment agreement, until the later of the
Effective Time or December 31, 2007 (such later date being the " _Retention
Date_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the employees Retention Amount
to the employee as soon as practicable thereafter. If the employment of a
listed employee is terminated by the Company or the Surviving Corporation
without "cause" (as defined in the employees change in control contract) or
by employee with "good reason" (as defined in the employees change in control
contract) prior to the Retention Date, the employee shall be paid the
employees Retention Amount as soon as practicable after such termination.

Section 6.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent
permitted by the FBCA or any other applicable Law or provided under the
Company Articles of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ _that_ such indemnification shall be subject to any
limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law. Parent shall
guarantee such performance by the Surviving Corporation.



 

45 (b) Parent understands and agrees that, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company intends to obtain a prepaid six-year " _tail_ " insurance policy that
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time, on terms
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys current
directors and officers insurance policy, for the Persons who are covered by
such policy on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not pay an aggregate premium in excess of 300% of the aggregate
amount per annum that the Company paid for such coverage in its last full
fiscal year prior to the date hereof, which amount the Company has disclosed
to Parent prior to the date hereof, but may purchase such coverage as may be
obtained for such 300% amount. The Company agrees that, prior to purchasing
any such policy, the Company shall afford Parent the opportunity to purchase a
substitute policy which (i) has an effective term of six years from the
Effective Time, (ii) covers those Persons who are currently covered by the
Companys current directors and officers insurance policy for actions and
omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the insured than those of
the Companys current directors and officers insurance policy; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section 6.9_ Parent
shall not be obligated to pay an aggregate premium in excess of 300% of the
aggregate amount per annum that the Company paid for such coverage in its last
full fiscal year prior to the date hereof, but shall be obligated to purchase
such coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount.

(c) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or
other agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger,
without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
Further, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and
officers than are presently set forth in the Company Articles of Incorporation
and Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals, except as amendments may be required by the FBCA during
such period.

(d) This _Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each
Indemnified Party, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified
Parties. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs, and his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority  



 

46  of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in _Section
6.8_ and this _Section 6.9_. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall not
distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation
unable to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 6.9_.

Section 6.10 _No Control of the Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents or
its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

Section 6.11 _Financing_

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause their Affiliates
to use, their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Financing, including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein
and (ii) to satisfy (or cause its Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis
all conditions, and otherwise comply with all terms, applicable to the Parent
and Merger Sub (or their Affiliates) in such definitive agreements. In the
event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitments, Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly notify the Company and shall use their reasonable best efforts
to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to
the Company true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any
such alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub
with any portion of the Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt
notice of any material breach by any party to the Financing Commitments or any
termination of the Financing Commitments. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
refrain (and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates to
refrain) from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably
be expected to result in a failure of any of the conditions contained in the
Financing Commitments or in any definitive agreement related to the
Financing. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing. Parent and Merger Sub may agree to or permit any material
amendment, supplement or other modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any material provision or remedy under, the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing and may obtain financing in
substitution of all or a portion of the Financing, so long as they consult
with the Company and promptly provide the Company with such information it may
reasonably request regarding any alternative financing arrangements or plans.

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and use
its reasonable best efforts to have its and their Representatives
cooperate with Parent and its Representatives in connection with the
arrangements by Parent and Merger Sub to obtain any  



 

47  debt financing or to facilitate Parents post-acquisition planning, and in
connection with the pre-payment of the Companys existing debt, as may be
reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided that_ such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or unreasonably interfere with or hinder or delay in any
material aspect the performance by the Company of its other obligations
hereunder), including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions and due
diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their financing
sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company
as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) assisting Parent and Merger
Sub and their financing sources in the preparation of (A) an offering document
for any debt raised to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) cooperating
with Parent and Merger Sub in connection with applications to obtain such
consents, approvals or authorizations which may be necessary or desirable in

are to be satisfied at the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, whether

connection herewith or therewith, nor shall the Company seek to recover any
money damages in excess of such applicable amount from the Parent, Merger Sub,
