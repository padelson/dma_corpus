ARTICLE 1 

   

 _PURCHASE AND SALE_  

   

1A. _Purchase and Sale of Acquired Securities_. On the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing and upon payment
of the Estimated Purchase Price and the delivery of the other amounts by
Buyer in accordance with _Section 1C_, Buyer shall purchase and accept from
the Sellers, and the Sellers shall sell to Buyer, free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Encumbrances of the type described in clause (i) of the
definition thereof or Liens created by Buyer), all of the Acquired
Securities. 

  

1B. _Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the closing of the purchase and sale of the Acquired Securities
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place, and the parties hereto shall consummate
such purchase and sale, at the Chicago, Illinois offices of Kirkland and Ellis

the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article 2_, except for
those conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing,
unless the parties shall mutually agree on another date. The date on which
the Closing shall occur is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." At
the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Buyer shall make the payments and deliveries contemplated by _Section 1C_
and deliver to the Representative all of the certificates, instruments and
documents required to be delivered by Buyer under _Section 2C_ in 

  

    #####

1C. _Closing Distributions_. 

   

(i) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company
shall provide Buyer with a statement setting forth its good faith estimate
(which estimate shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) of (i) the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness, (ii) the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital, and (iii) the Estimated Purchase Price resulting therefrom (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ "), together with an estimated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, as of the
Adjustment Calculation Time (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ")
(accompanied by any supporting work papers and other similar material used by
the Company to prepare the Estimated Closing Statement and the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet). 

   

(ii) At the Closing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Buyer shall pay to the Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers) an aggregate amount in cash (the " _Closing Cash Payment_ ") equal
to (x) the Estimated Purchase Price _less_ (y) the Escrow Deposit Amount, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds from Buyer to the account
designated by the Representative (which account shall be designated by the
Representative in writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date). The Closing Cash Payment shall be allocated among the
Sellers, and distributed to the Sellers by the Representative, in accordance
with written instructions which shall be delivered to Buyer not less than one
(1) Business Day prior to the Closing. 

   

(iii) At the Closing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the Escrow Deposit Amount to the Escrow Agent for deposit
into a separate escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") established
pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement, substantially in the form of
_Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), among Buyer, the Representative
and the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Funds shall be maintained separately in the
Escrow Account. The fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be paid 50%
by Buyer and 50% by the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). The Escrow
Account will be divided into the following two sub-accounts: 

   

(a) An aggregate amount in cash equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount shall be deposited into a separate subaccount (the " _Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Account_ "). The Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Amount shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. 

   

(b) An aggregate amount in cash equal to the General Escrow Amount shall
be deposited into a separate subaccount (the " _General Escrow Account_ ").
The General Escrow Amount shall be distributed in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. 

   

(iv) At the Closing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Buyer shall pay to the intended beneficiaries thereof (as
identified by the Representative to Buyer at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date) (a) amounts due and owing pursuant to the Funded
Indebtedness, (b) the Company Transaction Expenses, (c) the Representative
Expenses, and (d) any other liabilities included in the computation of 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Estimated Closing Indebtedness (other than the Ohio Matter Payoff Amount)
which Representative instructs Buyer to pay at the Closing. 

   

1D. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

   

(i) Within 120 days following the Closing Date, the Company shall, and Buyer
shall cause the Company to, prepare and deliver to the Representative (a) an
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Adjustment
Calculation Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and (b) a statement (the
" _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Companys calculation of Closing
Net Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness and the Purchase Price resulting
therefrom. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Applicable Accounting Principles.
The Closing Statement shall, with respect to the Closing Net Working Capital
and the Closing Indebtedness, be derived from the Closing Balance Sheet, and
shall, with respect to the Closing Net Working Capital and the Closing
Indebtedness, be prepared in accordance with the applicable definitions set
forth in this Agreement. During the 30 days immediately following the
Representatives receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement and any period of dispute with respect thereto thereafter, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Company to, (x) provide the Representative and its
representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
books, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents), supporting data and employees and accountants (subject to signing
a customary accountants release) of the Company related to the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement for purposes of their review
of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, and (y) cooperate
with the Representative and its representatives in connection with such
review, including providing on a timely basis all other information necessary
or useful in connection with the review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement as is reasonably requested by the Representative or
its representatives. The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the
resulting calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness
and the Purchase Price resulting therefrom shall become final and binding
upon the parties at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Prevailing Time on the 30th day
following the Representatives receipt thereof unless the Representative
gives written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to
Buyer prior to such date; _provided_ that the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement shall become final and binding after such 30 day period
with respect to any items not relating to the dispute identified in a Notice
of Disagreement; _provided_   _further_ that a Notice of Disagreement may
only be based on a claim that the Closing Balance Sheet (or the Closing
Statement or the components thereof) was not prepared in accordance, or is
otherwise inconsistent, with the terms of this Agreement; _provided_  
_further_ that the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the
resulting calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness
and the Purchase Price resulting therefrom shall become final and binding
upon the parties upon the Representatives delivery, prior to the expiration
of the 30-day period, of written notice to Buyer of its acceptance of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement
so asserted, and shall specify the line item or items on the Closing
Balance Sheet (or the Closing Statement, as applicable) which the
Representative disagrees with and the amount of each such line item or items
as calculated by the Representative. 

   

(ii) If a timely Notice of Disagreement is delivered by the Representative
pursuant to  _Section 1D(i)_, then the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement (as revised in accordance with this _Section 1D(ii)_), and the
resulting calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness
and the Purchase Price resulting therefrom, shall become final and binding
upon the parties on the earlier of (a) the date any and all matters specified
in the 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Notice of Disagreement are finally resolved in writing by the Representative
and Buyer and (b) the date any and all matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement not resolved by the Representative and Buyer are finally
resolved in writing by the Arbiter (as defined below). The Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing Statement shall be revised to the extent necessary to
reflect any resolution by the Representative and Buyer and any final
resolution made by the Arbiter in accordance with this _Section 1D(ii)_.
During the 30 days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement or such longer period as the Representative and Buyer may agree
in writing, the Representative and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve
in writing any differences which they may have with respect to any matter
specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and all such discussions related
thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and the Representative) be
governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable
similar state rule. At the end of such 30-day period, the Representative and
Buyer shall submit to KPMG LLP (the " _Arbiter_ ") for review and resolution
of any and all matters (but only such matters) which remain in dispute and
which were included in the Notice of Disagreement, and if KPMG LLP is
unwilling or unable to act in such capacity (or is conflicted), then the
Representative and Buyer shall attempt to mutually agree on who shall serve
as the Arbiter, and if the Representative and Buyer cannot agree upon the
Arbiter within ten (10) Business Days after KPMG LLP has given notice that it
will not serve as Arbiter, then the Representative and Buyer shall
each select, within five days of the end of such 10-day period, a nationally
recognized consulting or accounting firm with expertise in financial analysis
and the firm selected by the Representative and the firm selected by Buyer
shall mutually and promptly (and in any event within five days) select a
third nationally recognized consulting or accounting firm with expertise in
financial analysis to serve as the Arbiter. Buyer and the
Representative shall instruct the Arbiter to, and the Arbiter shall, make a
final determination of the items included in the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Statement (to the extent such amounts are in dispute) in
accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in this Agreement.
Buyer and the Representative will cooperate (and Buyer shall cause the Company
to cooperate) with the Arbiter during the term of its engagement. Buyer and
the Representative shall instruct the Arbiter not to, and the Arbiter shall
not, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value
for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Representative, on
the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by
Buyer, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other hand. Buyer and
the Representative shall also instruct the Arbiter to, and the Arbiter shall,
make its determination based solely on presentations by Buyer and the
Representative that are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set
forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an independent
review). The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the resulting
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness and
the Purchase Price resulting therefrom shall become final and binding on the
parties hereto on the date the Arbiter delivers its final resolution in
writing to Buyer and the Representative (which final resolution shall be
requested by the terms of the engagement with the Arbiter to be not more than
30 days from the date of such engagement and no more than 10 Business Days
from the final submission of information and testimony by Buyer
and Representative to the Arbiter), and such resolution by the Arbiter shall
not be subject to court review or otherwise appealable but shall be
enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of
the Arbiter pursuant to this _Section 1D(ii)_ shall be borne by Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Representative, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the aggregate portion of the contested amount not awarded to
each party bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by such party. 

   

(iii) If the Estimated Purchase Price is less than the Purchase Price (such
shortfall, the " _Deficit Amount_ "), then within five (5) Business Days
after the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement become final and
binding on the parties pursuant to this  _Section 1D_, (a) Buyer shall make
payment of the Deficit Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) and (b) Buyer and the Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the
Escrow Agent to immediately make payment to, or as directed by, the
Representative of an amount equal to the entire amount in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account. If the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than
the Purchase Price (such excess, the " _Excess Amount_ "), then within five
(5) Business Days after the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement become final and binding on the parties pursuant to this _Section
1D_, Buyer and the Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to immediately make payments in
the following order: (x) first, to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to, or as directed by, Buyer, an amount equal to the Excess
Amount from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account (and to the
extent there are not sufficient funds in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Account, from the General Escrow Account), and (y) second, to the
Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to, or as
directed by, the Representative, an amount equal to the entire amount then
remaining in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account (if any) after
Buyer has first received payment in accordance with clause (x) above. 

   

(iv) Any payment pursuant to _Section 1D(iii)_ shall be made together
with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest
published by _The Wall Street Journal_ as the "prime rate" at large U.S.
money center banks on the Closing Date, calculated on the basis of the number
of days elapsed from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Any interest
payable by Buyer shall be paid to the Representative. 

   

(v) Subject to _Section 10I_, any amounts received by the Representative
pursuant to this _Section 1D_ shall be received for the benefit of the
Sellers. 

   

(vi) Buyer and the Sellers agree that (a) the payment of the Excess Amount (if
any) from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and, if applicable,
the General Escrow Account as provided in _Section 1D(iii)_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for Buyer for payment of the Excess Amount (if any)
and (b) the working capital adjustment and indebtedness adjustment provided
for in this _Section 1D_, and the dispute resolution provisions provided for
in this _Section 1D_, shall be the exclusive remedies for the matters
addressed therein. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no claim by Buyer for the payment of the Excess
Amount shall be asserted against the Seller Parties. 

  

1E. _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to
this Agreement and as increased by the amounts treated as assumed Company
liabilities for federal income tax purposes and other amounts treated as
taxable sales consideration for federal income tax purposes) shall be
allocated to the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than
the assets of the Partnership Subsidiaries and Regency Management Company,
Inc.) for all Tax purposes in accordance with their respective fair market
values pursuant to an allocation schedule to be prepared after the Closing in
accordance with Sections 1060, 741, and 751 of the Code and the regulations
adopted thereunder and using the methodologies set forth on _Schedule 1E_
(the " _Asset Allocation_ "). Within 120 days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall deliver a copy of its initial determination of the Asset Allocation to
the Representative. The Representative shall, within 30 days after receipt of
the initial determination of the Asset Allocation by Buyer, notify Buyer if
it disagrees with such initial determination (provided that Representative
shall not disagree with any allocation to the stock of Regency Management
Company, Inc. determined by Buyer to be equal to the adjusted tax basis of
the assets less any liabilities of such entity as of the Closing Date), and
if the Representative does not so notify Buyer within such 30 days, the
initial Asset Allocation shall be final and binding on the parties. If the
Representative disagrees with such initial Asset Allocation (subject to the
proviso in the immediately preceding sentence), Buyer and the Representative
shall make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute. If Buyer and
the Representative have 

  

    ##### 

  

   

been unable to resolve their differences within 30 days after Buyer has been
notified of the Representatives disagreement with the initial Asset
Allocation, then any remaining disputed issues shall be submitted to the
Arbiter, who shall resolve the disagreement in a final binding manner
in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section
1D(ii)_ of this Agreement. Except as may be required by applicable Legal
Requirements, Buyer and the Representative on behalf of the Sellers will (i)
prepare all Tax books, records, and filings (including Internal Revenue
Service Forms 8594 and 8308) in a manner consistent with the Asset Allocation
(as determined pursuant to this _Section 1E_) and (ii) not take any action
inconsistent therewith with respect to Tax matters.

9B. _Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the Closing (but subject to
the provisions of this _Article 9_), Buyer shall indemnify the Seller
Parties against, and hold harmless the Seller Parties from, any and all
Losses resulting from or relating to (i) the failure of any representation or
warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement, or in the Buyer
Closing Certificate or the Buyer Secretary Certificate, to be true and
correct as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date as if made
anew as of such date, or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of
Buyer contained in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and any breach of
any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement requiring performance after the Closing. 

   

9C. _Claims against the General Escrow Amount_. 

   

(i) Following the Closing, the Buyer Parties sole and exclusive remedy and
source of recovery for any Losses (other than Losses resulting from or
relating to any breach of the Fundamental Representations or of a covenant of
any Seller requiring performance after the Closing, or in respect of claims
pursuant to _Section 9A(vi)_, _Section 9A(vii)_ or _Section 9A(viii)_ or
claims for fraud (collectively, " _Direct Claims_ ")) is the portion of the
General Escrow Amount remaining at any given time in the General
Escrow Account. Following the Closing, except for Direct Claims, which may be
asserted directly against any Seller Party, no claim by Buyer for Losses
under this Agreement or otherwise shall be asserted directly against the
Seller Parties or any of them. Subject to the provisions of this _Article 9_
(including the pro rata nature of the indemnity obligations hereunder),
following the Closing, Buyer shall only be entitled to assert claims directly
against any or all of the Sellers in respect of any Losses resulting from
or relating to any Direct Claims, and a Buyer Party may at its option and in
its sole discretion, in addition to any other remedies available to it, also
assert such Direct Claims against the portion of the General Escrow Amount
then remaining in the General Escrow Account. 

   

(ii) Within two (2) Business Days after the date that is 12 months following
the Closing Date (such date that is twelve months following the Closing Date,
the " _General Survival Date_ "), Buyer and the Representative shall cause
the Escrow Agent (including by delivering joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent) to release to, or as directed by, the Representative an amount
in cash equal to $5,000,000 _minus_ the sum of (a) the amount for which
claims for indemnification were made against the General Escrow Account prior
to the General Survival Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and that are not yet resolved as of the General Survival Date (the " _Claim
Amount_ ") and (b) the amount paid out of the General Escrow Account to any
Buyer Party prior to the General Survival Date. At any time after the General
Survival Date, within five (5) Business Days after Buyer determines that all
or any portion of the Claim Amount is not owed to Buyer hereunder, or a court
of competent jurisdiction finally determines, that a Buyer Party is not
entitled to all or a portion of the Claim Amount, Buyer and the Representative
shall cause the Escrow Agent (including by delivering joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent) to release to, or as directed by, the
Representative on behalf of the Sellers such portion of the Claim Amount that
the Sellers would otherwise have been entitled to receive on the General
Survival Date; _provided_ , that no such amount shall be released
from the General Escrow Account upon such determination in the event that
there are not sufficient funds remaining in the General Escrow Account to
cover any Extended Claim Amount. 

   

(iii) Within two (2) Business Days after the date that is 18 months following
the Closing Date (such date that is eighteen months following the Closing
Date, the " _Extended Survival Date_ "), Buyer and the Representative shall
cause the Escrow Agent (including by delivering joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent) to release to, or as directed by, the Representative an
amount in cash equal to (a) all remaining Escrow Funds in the General Escrow
Account, _minus_ (b) the amount for which claims for indemnification were
made against the 

   

    ##### 

 

   

General Escrow Account prior to the Extended Survival Date (including any
Claim Amount) (the " _Extended Claim Amount_ ") in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and that are not yet resolved as of the Extended Survival
Date. At any time after the Extended Survival Date, within five (5) Business
Days after Buyer determines that all or any portion of the Extended Claim
Amount is not owed to Buyer hereunder, or a court of competent jurisdiction
finally determines, that a Buyer Party is not entitled to all or a portion
of the Extended Claim Amount, Buyer and the Representative shall cause the
Escrow Agent (including by delivering joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent) to release to the Representative on behalf of the Sellers such
portion of the Extended Claim Amount. 

   

(iv) In the event that Buyer Parties make a claim for indemnification
hereunder and (a) the Representative agrees with such claim in whole or in
part or (b) a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines that the
Buyer Parties are entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the
Representative and Buyer shall, no later than five (5) Business
Days thereafter cause the Escrow Agent (including by delivering joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent) to release to, or as directed by, Buyer
from the General Escrow Account the amount to which Buyer is entitled
hereunder. 

   

(v) Subject to _Section 10I_, any amounts received by the Representative
pursuant to this _Section 9C_ shall be received for the benefit of all
Sellers. 

  

9D. _Exclusive Remedy_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that, from and
after the Closing (except for actions seeking specific performance or similar
equitable relief pursuant to  _Section 11Q_, disputes under _Section 1D_,
which disputes will be resolved in accordance with the dispute mechanism set
forth in _Section 1D_, and fraud claims), its sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may
have against any Indemnifying Party or any Seller Parties relating to the
operation of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses,
or resulting from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the
Company Disclosure Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, whether arising under or based upon any Legal Requirements or
otherwise (including any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek
indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other recourse
or remedy, including as may arise under common law), shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article 9_. In furtherance
of the foregoing, each of Buyer (on its own behalf and on behalf of the other
Buyer Parties), the Sellers (each on his, her or its own behalf and on behalf
of the other Seller Parties who are not signatories hereto) and the Company
hereby (x) covenants and agrees that (other than as provided in the first
sentence of this _Section 9D_), from and after the Closing, he, she or it
will not, directly or indirectly, assert or otherwise bring any claim, cause
of action or demand, or commence or institute or cause to be commenced or
instituted, any proceeding of any kind or nature relating to the operation of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, or
resulting from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the
Company Disclosure Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, whether arising under or based upon any Legal Requirements or
otherwise (including any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to
seek indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other
recourse or remedy, including as may arise under common law), other than
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article 9_,
and (y) waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action it may have against any Indemnifying Party or any Seller
Parties relating to the operation of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and
the Company Disclosure Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, whether arising under or based upon any Legal Requirements or
otherwise (including any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek
indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other 

  

    ##### 

  

   

recourse or remedy, including as may arise under common law) other than as
provided in the first sentence of this _Section 9D_. 

  

9E. _Termination of Indemnification_. Subject to the final sentence of this
_Section 9E_ , the obligations under _Sections 9A(i)_, _9A(ii)_ , _9B(i)_
and  _9B(ii)_ shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty
or covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 10A_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such obligations shall not terminate with respect to any item as to
which the Person to be indemnified shall have, prior to the applicable
Limitation Date, previously made a claim by delivering a written notice to
the Indemnifying Party meeting the requirements set forth in _Section
10A_. Subject to the final sentence of this _Section 9E_, the obligations
under _Sections 9A(iii)_ , _9A(iv)_ and _9A(v)_ shall terminate on the
Extended Survival Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations shall
not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Person to be
indemnified shall have, on or prior to the Extended Survival Date, previously
made a claim by delivering a written notice to the Indemnifying Party meeting
the requirements set forth in _Section 10A_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, unless earlier terminated in accordance
with this Agreement, all obligations under _Section 9A_ (other than
obligations in respect of Direct Claims) shall terminate at such time as the
General Escrow Amount has been disbursed from the General Escrow Account (it
being understood that such time could be before the General Survival Date and
the Extended Survival Date). 

   

9F. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_. 

   

(i) In order for a Person that has rights of indemnification under this
Agreement (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of a claim or
demand made by any Person (other than an Indemnified Party) against the
Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must
notify the indemnifying party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing (and
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such Indemnified
Partys belief that such right to indemnification may exist to the extent
known) of the Third Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days after receipt
by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
that failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that for purposes of making claims against the Escrow Amount (or
the Sellers in respect of Direct Claims), written notice to the
Representative shall be deemed written notice to the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Section 9F(i)_. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five (5) Business Days after the
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that failure to deliver such notices
and documents on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

   

(ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it elects, to control the defense thereof, in each case at its own
expense, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ _,_  that notice of the
intention to so control the defense shall be delivered by the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days after the date
of receipt by the Indemnifying Party of notice by the Indemnified Party of
the assertion of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to control the defense only if (a) the
claim does not seek equitable relief or, if the claim does seek equitable
relief, such claim for equitable relief is merely incidental to a claim for
monetary relief, (b) the Indemnifying Party verifies in writing to
the Indemnified Party its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
hereunder against Losses that may result from such 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Third Party Claim, subject in all respects to the provisions of this _Article
9_, (c) (x) in the case of claims in respect of _Section 9A(i)_ (other than
in respect of any Fundamental Representations), _Section 9A(iii)_,  _Section
9A(iv)_ or _Section 9A(v)_, there are sufficient funds remaining in
the General Escrow Account to satisfy any obligation to provide such
indemnification to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party
Claim along with any and all other pending indemnification claims in respect
of such Sections of this Agreement, and (y) in the case of claims in respect
of the Fundamental Representations, _Section 9A(ii)_,  _Section 9A(vi)_,
_Section 9A(vii)_ or _Section 9A(viii)_, the Indemnifying Party can
reasonably demonstrate that it has the funds necessary to satisfy
any obligation to provide such indemnification to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim along with any and all other pending
indemnification claims in respect of such Sections of this Agreement, and (d)
in the case of claims in respect of _Section 9A(i)_ , _Section 9A(iii)_,
_Section 9A(iv)_ or for any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in
_Section 3F_, _Section 3G_ or _Section 3H_, if the amount of such Third
Party Claim exceeds 150% of the amount of any remaining deductible that is
applicable under _Section 9G(ii)(a)_, _Section 9G(ii)(b)_ or
_Section 9G(ii)(c)_ (the foregoing collectively, the " _Litigation
Conditions_ ");  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall
forfeit the right to control the defense of any such claim if, at any time
after assuming the defense or settlement thereof, the Indemnifying Party no
longer satisfies the Litigation Conditions or fails to diligently contest,
defend or litigate such claims in good faith. Should an Indemnifying Party
elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to
the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party has not employed counsel to assume the defense of such
action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of
the action, (ii) the employment of counsel and the amount reimbursable
therefor by the Indemnified Party has been authorized in writing by the
Indemnifying Party or (iii) representation of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party by the same counsel would, in the reasonable opinion of the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, constitute a conflict of interest
under applicable standards of professional conduct. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense (subject to the previous sentence), separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense so long as the Indemnifying
Party continues to have the right to control such defense in accordance
with this _Section 9F(ii)_. All the parties hereto shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and provision to the party controlling the defense (upon the
request of such controlling party) to records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party shall
be obligated to reimburse Indemnified Party for the reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses related to such cooperation. The Indemnifying Party shall have full
authority to determine all action to be taken with respect to a Third Party
Claim the defense of which it has elected to assume in accordance with this
_Section 9F(ii)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that that the Indemnifying Party
shall obtain the prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the Indemnified Party prior to
admitting any liability with respect to, consenting to the entry of any
judgment, or settling, compromising or discharging any Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume the control of the defense of
any such Third Party Claim, fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its
election as herein provided, fails to satisfy the Litigation Conditions or
fails to diligently contest, defend or litigate such Third Party Claim in
good faith, the Indemnified Party may pay, compromise or defend such Third
Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall
obtain the prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or 

  

    ##### 

  

   

delayed) of the Indemnifying Party prior to admitting any liability with
respect to, consenting to the entry of any judgment, or settling,
compromising or discharging any Third Party Claim. 

   

9G. _Certain Additional Matters_. 

   

(i) The amount of any and all Losses under this _Article 9_ shall be
determined net of the amount of any proceeds actually received by an
Indemnified Party or any of such Indemnified Partys Affiliates under or
pursuant to any insurance policy, title insurance policy, indemnity,
reimbursement arrangement or contract pursuant to which or under which such
Indemnified Party or such Indemnified Partys Affiliates is a party or has
rights (collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_ ") (net of (i) any
increase in premiums, (ii) retroactive premiums, (iii) premium adjustments,
or (iv) any deductible incurred in obtaining such proceeds). If the
Indemnified Party receives any such proceeds subsequent to an indemnification
payment by the Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses, then
such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party in an
amount equal to the amount by which such indemnification payment would have
been reduced had such proceeds been received by the Indemnified Party prior
to such payment by the Indemnifying Party. 

   

(ii) 

   

(a) No Buyer Party shall be entitled to indemnification or other
recovery pursuant to _Section 9A(i)_ or for any breach of any covenant or

and until the aggregate amount of all Losses under _Section 9A(i)_,
_Section 9A(iii)_ , _Section 9A(iv)_ and for any breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in _Section 3F_, _Section 3G_ or _Section 3H_
(other than Losses (x) resulting from or relating to breaches of
Fundamental Representations or _Section 5E(v)_, for which no such limitation
shall apply, or (y) that have been recovered by a Buyer Party pursuant to
_Section 9A(iii)_ or _Section 9A(iv)_) exceeds on a cumulative basis an
amount equal to $1,400,000, and then, such Buyer Party shall only be entitled
to recover to the extent of such excess (subject to _Section 9C(i)_);
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the limitations set forth in this _Section
9G(ii)(a)_ shall not apply to claims arising from breaches of Fundamental
Representations or  _Section 5E(v)_. 

   

(b) No Buyer Party shall be entitled to indemnification or other
recovery pursuant to _Section 9A(iii)_, unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Losses under _Section 9A(iii)_ exceeds on a cumulative basis
an amount equal to $250,000, and then such Buyer Party shall only be entitled
to recover to the extent of such excess (subject to _Section 9C(i)_). 

   

(c) No Buyer Party shall be entitled to indemnification or other
recovery pursuant to _Section 9A(iv)_, unless and until the aggregate amount
of all Losses under _Section 9A(iv)_ exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount
equal to $250,000, and then such Buyer Party shall only be entitled to
recover to the extent of such excess (subject to _Section 9C(i)_). 

   

(d) No Buyer Party shall assert any claim or series of related
claims whatsoever pursuant to _Section 9A_ (except for a breach of
_Section 5E(v)_ ), and no Buyer Party shall be entitled to indemnification or
other recovery whatsoever pursuant to _Section 9A_ (except for a breach of 
_Section 5E(v)_), for any Losses resulting from, or arising out of any
Outlier Adjustment. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
(1) the aggregate cumulative liability of a Seller under this _Article 9_
shall in no event exceed the aggregate proceeds actually received by such
Seller and (2) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any amount
under this _Article 9_ more than once in respect of the same Loss. 

   

(iii) No Seller Party shall assert any claim or series of related claims
pursuant to  _Section 9B(i)_, and no Seller Party shall be entitled to
indemnification or other recovery pursuant to _Section 9B(i)_, unless and
until the aggregate amount of all Losses under _Section 9B(i)_ (other than
Losses resulting from or relating to breaches of Fundamental Representations)
exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $1,400,000, and then such
Indemnified Party shall only be entitled to recover to the extent of
such excess (subject to _Section 9C(i)_); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing limitation shall not apply to claims arising from breaches of
Fundamental Representations. 

   

(iv) In no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to recover or make a
claim for any amounts in respect of, and in no event shall "Losses" be deemed
to include punitive or exemplary damages (except to the extent imposed on an
Indemnified Party in connection with a Third Party Claim) or any Losses to
the extent included as a liability in the calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital or Closing Indebtedness. 

   

(v) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company, the Sellers or Buyer in this
Agreement or in any Certificate and for purposes of calculating the amount of
Losses to which an Indemnified Party is entitled as a result of any such
breach, such representation or warranty shall not be deemed qualified by any
"material," "materiality," "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications; _provided_ _,_ _however_
_,_ that this  _Section 9G(v)_ shall not apply to the representations and
warranties set forth in the first sentence of _Section 5A_, the third
sentence of _Section 5C(i)_,  _Section 5E(i)_, _Section 5G_, _Section 5J_
and the first sentence of  _Section 5T(i)_. 

   

(vi) The representations and warranties of the parties shall not be affected
or diminished by, and no right of indemnification hereunder shall be limited
by reason of any investigation or audit conducted before or after the Closing
or the knowledge of any party of any breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement by the other party at any time, or the decision of any
party to complete the Closing. 

   

(vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no limitation
or condition of liability or indemnity shall apply to any fraud claims. 

   

(viii) Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless not permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements. 

   

(ix) Each Seller waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such Seller shall
not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert),
any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy
against the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which he or it may
become subject under or in connection with this Agreement. 

   

(x) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any
Seller be responsible to Buyer (whether pursuant to indemnification hereunder
or otherwise) for any breach 

  

    ##### 

  

   

or violation by another Seller of any particular representation or warranty
or covenant or agreement of such breaching Seller in this Agreement, and each
of the parties hereto shall take all actions necessary (including actions
under or in connection with the Escrow Agreement) to effect the foregoing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not in any way effect
Buyers ability to make claims for indemnification against, and recover from,
the entire amount contained in the General Escrow Account.

commercial practices of Buyer or the Company or either of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates. For purposes of this _Section 10D_ and _Section
3H_ and _Section 10E_, the "commercially reasonable efforts" of each party
shall include such partys agreement to respond to a "Second Request" but
shall not otherwise require such party or any of its Affiliates to expend any
money to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty hereunder, to
commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding, to offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party, to obtain any
consent required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or, in the case of the Company and its Affiliates, to provide financing to
Buyer for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

10E. _Regulatory Act Compliance_. Buyer and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to file or cause to be filed, promptly (but
in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement,
any notifications or the like required to be filed under the HSR Act and
other antitrust or competition laws of any applicable jurisdiction
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and the Company
shall bear the costs and expenses of their respective filings, but Buyer
shall pay all filing fees under the HSR Act in connection therewith. Buyer
and the Company shall respond as promptly as practicable to any requests for
information, including a "Second Request", made by any agencies and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the waiting periods or other
requirements under the HSR Act and all other applicable antitrust or
competition laws to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date
(including with respect to filings under the HSR Act, seeking early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act). Each of Buyer and the
Company shall (A) unless otherwise prohibited by applicable Legal
Requirement, promptly notify each other of any communication to that party
from the Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ "), the United States Department of
Justice (" _DOJ_ ") or any other regulatory agency with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and permit the other party to review in
advance any proposed written communication to the FTC, the DOJ or any other
regulatory agency; (B) unless otherwise prohibited by applicable
Legal Requirement, furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence,
filings and other communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) between it, its Affiliates and their respective representatives, on
the one hand, and the FTC, the DOJ or any other regulatory agency, or members
of their respective staffs, on the other hand, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby (excluding documents and communications
which are subject to pre-existing confidentiality agreements or to attorney-
client or other applicable privilege); (C) give the other party prompt notice
of the threat or commencement of any Legal Proceeding by or before
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Agreement or any of the other
transactions 

  

    ##### 

  

   

contemplated hereby, (D) keep the other party informed as to the status of
any such Legal Proceeding and (E) not agree to participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or
other inquiry with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, in each case to the extent
practicable. The Company and Buyer will consult and cooperate with one
another, and will consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any Legal
Proceeding under or relating to any federal or state antitrust or fair trade
law. The Company and Buyer will also furnish the other party with such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party and its
affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of
necessary filings, registrations, or submissions of information to any
Governmental Entities in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including without limitation any filings necessary or
appropriate under the provisions of the HSR Act (in each case, if requested
by the disclosing party). 

   

10F. _Certain Tax Matters_. 

   

(i) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. The Representative shall prepare
or cause to be prepared, and timely file or cause to be timely filed, all
federal, state and local income Tax Returns for the Company for periods
ending on or before the Closing Date. All such income Tax Returns shall be
prepared consistent with the past practice of the Company, except as
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirement. The Representative shall
allow Buyer the opportunity to review and comment on such income Tax Returns
to be filed after the date hereof for a reasonable period prior to the
intended filing date. 

   

(ii) _Amendment of Tax Returns_. Without the prior written consent of the
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, neither Buyer nor the Representative will amend or permit the
Company to amend any income Tax Return filed by or with respect to the
Company relating to the taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date
and the portion of any Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date,
unless required by Legal Requirement. 

   

(iii) _Tax Audits_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
but after Buyer has received written confirmation from the Representative of
the Sellers indemnification obligations under _Article 9_, the
Representative shall have the right in its discretion to elect to represent
the interests of the Company and the Sellers in any claim, audit,
examination, or administrative or court proceeding solely relating to
any audits or assessments or other disputes regarding any income Tax Return
filed by the Company with respect to tax periods that end on or before the
Closing Date (" _Tax Proceeding_ ") but only to the extent such claim, audit,
examination, or administrative or court proceeding may impact Sellers
indemnification obligations under _Article 9_. Buyer shall promptly notify
the Representative in writing upon receiving notice from any taxing authority
of the commencement of any Tax Proceeding regarding any income Tax
Return filed by or with respect to the Company with respect to tax periods
that end on or before the Closing Date, and Buyer shall take all action
reasonably necessary to enable the Representative to exercise its control
rights as set forth in this _Section 10F(iii)_. 

   

(iv) _Cooperation_. Buyer, the Company and the Representative shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with the filing of income Tax Returns pursuant to this
_Section 10F(iv)_ and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, 

  

    ##### 

  

   

litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Company shall retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any tax
periods and shall abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority, and shall give the Representative reasonable
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
for that Tax period, and if the Representative so requests, the Company shall
allow the Representative to take possession of such books and records rather
than destroying or discarding such books and records. 

   

(v) _Tax Treatment_. The parties hereto acknowledge that, consistent with
Revenue Ruling 99-6, I.R.B. 1999-6, the purchase and sale of the Acquired
Securities by Buyer shall be treated for United States federal income Tax
purposes as an acquisition of the assets of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Partnership Subsidiaries and Regency Management
Company, Inc.) by Buyer as to Buyer and the sale of partnership interests as
to the Sellers, within the purview of Section 741 of the Code. 

   

10G. _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_. 

   

(i) For a six-year period after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall
not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify
any provision in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Organizational
Documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification of officers and
director or managers of the Company or its Subsidiaries as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that any such provision may be
amended, repealed or modified as it applies to officers, directors or managers
of the Company and its Subsidiaries who were not officers, directors or
managers of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. 

   

(ii) Prior to Closing, the Company shall obtain effective as of the Closing an
extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors
and officers liability insurance policy, with aggregate coverage equal to the
greater of (a) the amount of aggregate coverage in effect on the date of this
Agreement and (b) the amount of aggregate coverage in effect immediately
prior to the Closing, insuring the directors and officers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for anything done or not done by such directors or
officers in any such capacity whether pertaining to any act or omission
occurring or existing prior to or at the Closing Date and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date, with a minimum six year term
(the " _Tail Policy_ "). The premiums related to the Tail Policy shall either
be paid prior to the Closing or be included as a current liability in the
calculation of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Net Working
Capital. 

   

(iii) The obligations of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates under
this  _Section 10G_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as
to adversely affect any Person to whom this _Section 10G_ applies without
the prior consent of such affected Person. 

  

10H. _Designation and Replacement of Representative_. The Sellers have agreed
that it is desirable to designate the Representative to act on behalf of the
Sellers for certain limited purposes, as specified herein. The Sellers have
designated Waud Capital Partners, L.L.C. as the initial Representative, and
execution of this Agreement by the Sellers shall, to the maximum
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirement, constitute irrevocable
ratification and approval of such designation by the Sellers and
authorization of the Representative by Sellers to serve in such capacity
(including to settle any and all disputes with Buyer under this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement), and shall also constitute a 

  

    ##### 

  

   

reaffirmation, approval, acceptance and adoption of, and an agreement to
comply with and perform, all of the acknowledgments and agreements made by
the Representative on behalf of the Sellers in this Agreement and the other
documents delivered in connection herewith (including the Escrow Agreement).
The Representative may resign of its choosing at any time upon written notice
to the Sellers and Buyer, such resignation not to be effective until a
replacement is appointed in accordance with this  _Section 10H_. The
designation of the Representative is coupled with an interest, and, except as
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, such designation is
irrevocable and shall not be affected by the death, incapacity, illness,
bankruptcy, dissolution or other inability to act of any of the Sellers. In
the event that the Representative has resigned, a new Representative shall be
appointed by a vote of Persons which collectively owned more than 50% of the
Class A Units of the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "
_Majority Holders_ "), such appointment to become effective upon the written
acceptance thereof by the new Representative. Written notice of any such
resignation, removal or appointment of a Representative shall be delivered by
the Representative to Buyer promptly after such action is taken. 

  

10I. _Authority and Rights of Representative; Limitations on Liability_.
The Representative shall have all such powers and authority as are necessary
or appropriate to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement
and in any other document delivered in connection herewith (including the
Escrow Agreement), including all (and the exclusive) power and authority to
settle any and all disputes with Buyer under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and to amend this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated
hereby in any and all respects on behalf of all Sellers, in each case, as the
Representative determines in its sole discretion, which settlements and
amendments shall bind all Sellers hereto as if such Sellers made such
settlement or executed such amendment; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Representative will have no obligation to act on behalf of the Sellers. The
Company, Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on the actions
taken by the Representative without independent inquiry into the capacity of
the Representative to so act. Neither Buyer nor Company (a) need be concerned
with the authority of the Representative to act on behalf of the Sellers
hereunder to the extent provided herein or (b) shall be held liable or
accountable in any manner for any act or omission of the Representative in
such capacity. All actions, notices, communications and determinations by
the Representative to carry out such functions shall conclusively be deemed
to have been authorized by, and shall be binding upon, the Sellers. Neither
the Representative nor any of its members, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents or representatives shall have any liability to the Sellers
with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Representative in
such capacity (or any of its members, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents or representatives in connection therewith), except with
respect to the Representatives willful misconduct. The Representative will
at all times be entitled to rely on any directions received from the
Majority Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Representative shall not
be required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to
take any action in its capacity as Representative based upon any such
direction. The Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in
connection with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder
and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Representative) shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The
Representative (for itself and its members, officers, directors,
managers, employees, agents and representatives) shall be entitled to full
reimbursement from the Sellers for all expenses, disbursements and advances
(including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents
and consultants) incurred by the Representative in such capacity (or any of
its members, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents or
representatives in connection therewith), and to full indemnification against
any Loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be
taken in its capacity as Representative (except for those arising out of the
Representatives willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of
investigation and defense of claims, from the Sellers (including from funds
paid to the Representative under this Agreement and/or otherwise received by
it in its capacity as the Representative, or funds to be distributed to the
Sellers under this Agreement at its direction, pursuant to or in connection
with this Agreement (including under the Escrow Agreement)). In furtherance
of the 

  

    ##### 

  

   

foregoing, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Representative shall have the power and authority to set aside and retain
funds paid to or received by it, or direct payment of funds to be paid to the
Sellers, as Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement at Closing or
thereafter, to satisfy such obligations (including to establish such reserves
as the Representative determines in good faith to be appropriate for such
costs and expenses that are not then known or determinable or to otherwise
satisfy any reasonable purpose determined by the Representative in its sole
discretion). To the extent that any amount included as Representative
Expenses exceeds such expenses, disbursements or advances, the Representative
may retain such excess as a fee for the services it provides hereunder. The
relationship created herein is not to be construed as a joint venture or any
form of partnership between or among the Representative or any Seller for any
purpose of U.S. federal or state law, including federal or state income tax
purposes. Neither the Representative nor any of its Affiliates owes any
fiduciary or other duty to any Seller. 

  

10J. _Representation of the Seller Group_. Each of the Company and the Sellers
hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, managers,
members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Kirkland and Ellis
LLP may serve as counsel to each and any of the Representative, the Sellers
and their respective Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
(individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), on the one hand, and,
if requested by the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that, following the Closing, Kirkland and Ellis LLP (or
any successor) may serve as counsel to each and any of the Seller Group or
any director, manager, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the
Seller Group (but after the Closing, excluding the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries), in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, notwithstanding any current or previous representation of the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, and each of the parties hereto hereby
consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and
each of such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive
any conflict of interest arising from such representation. The foregoing
waiver shall not apply in the event applicable ethical rules prohibit such a
waiver. 

  

10K. _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
consummation of the Closing, each party shall pay all fees and expenses
incurred by such party in connection with the negotiation, preparation and
performance of and compliance with the terms of this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the fees and expenses of legal counsel,
accountants, investment bankers or other representatives and consultants) and
the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise required by applicable
Legal Requirement. If the Closing occurs, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be
paid, all fees and expenses incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirement, and any and all Company
Transaction Expenses and Representative Expenses to the extent such fees and
expenses are included as current liabilities in the calculation of Closing
Net Working Capital or as Closing Indebtedness; _provided_ , that the Sellers
shall pay one-half (1/2) and Buyer shall pay one-half (1/2) of all property,
transfer or similar taxes imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries and any
transfer or similar tax imposed on any Seller resulting from the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

  

10L. _Certain Access Provisions_. For a period of seven (7) years after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall preserve and retain, or cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to preserve and retain, all material corporate, accounting, Tax,
legal, auditing or other books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to the conduct of the business and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

10M. _No Solicitation; Confidentiality_. 

   

(i) For a period of one (1) year from and after the Closing Date, no Seller
shall, and each Seller shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Buyer: (i) solicit or direct
any other Person to solicit any CEO Employee to: (A) terminate such CEO
Employees employment with Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company; or (B) seek or accept employment or other affiliation with any
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than, in each case, any solicitation
directed at the public in general in publications available to the public in
general or any contact which such Seller can demonstrate was initiated by
such CEO Employee or any contact one (1) year after such CEO Employees
employment with Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
is terminated) or (ii) hire, employ or retain as a consultant or direct any
other person to hire, employ or retain as a consultant, any CEO Employee
(other than any hiring, employing or retaining resulting from (X) such CEO
Employee responding to a solicitation directed at the public in general in
publications available to the public in general, (Y) contact which such
Seller can demonstrate was initiated by such CEO Employee or (Z) contact one
(1) year after such CEO Employees employment with Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is terminated). 

   

(ii) For a period of ninety (90) days from and after the Closing Date, no
Seller shall, and each Seller shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Buyer: (i) solicit or direct
any other Person to solicit any Person who was an employee of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company at the office located at 11175 Cicero Drive,
Alpharetta, Georgia on the Closing Date (or any Person who is an employee at
such location within six months prior to the Closing Date) to: (A)
terminate such employees employment with Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company; or (B) seek or accept employment or other
affiliation with any Seller or any of its Affiliates or (ii) hire, employ or
retain as a consultant or direct any other person to hire, employ or retain
as a consultant, any such employee; provided that the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 10M(ii)_ shall not apply to any employee set forth on
_Section 10M(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

   

(iii) The Sellers hereby acknowledge and agree that if any Seller or any one
or more of its Affiliates breaches any provision of this _Section 10M_, any
remedy at law would be inadequate and that Buyer, in addition to seeking
monetary damages in connection with any such breach, shall be entitled to
specific performance, and injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain a breach of this _Section 10M_ or to enforce the provisions
hereof. 

   

(iv) The Sellers and Buyer intend that the provisions of this _Section 10M_
be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws applied in each
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If any provision of this
_Section 10M_, or any part hereof, shall be held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, this _Section 10M_ shall be
amended to revise the scope of such provision, to make it enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, if possible, or to
delete such provision or such part, such revision or deletion to apply only
with respect to the operation of this _Section 10M_ in the jurisdiction of
such court.

ARTICLE 11 

   

 _MISCELLANEOUS_  

    

11A. _Amendment and Waiver_. 

   

(i) This Agreement may be amended; _provided_ _that_ any amendment shall
be binding only if such amendment is set forth in a writing executed by the
Representative (on behalf of all Sellers), the Company and Buyer. No course
of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in this Agreement
shall be deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of this
Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Person under or by reason of
this Agreement. 

   

(ii) No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have
waived any claim arising out of this Agreement or any power, right, privilege
or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power,
right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument
duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of such Person; and any such
waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific

11C. _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned
(including by operation of law) without the prior written consent of (i) prior
to the Closing, the Representative, the Company and Buyer and (ii) from and
after the Closing, Buyer and the Representative; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer may assign, without the prior written consent of any other party
hereto (whereupon Buyer shall provide written notice thereof to the Sellers,
the Company and the Representative), any of its rights, benefits or
obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate of Buyer, and after the
Closing, Buyer may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement in
whole or in part to any other Person; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

11D. _Severability_. Without limiting _Section 10M(iv)_, whenever possible,
each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
enforceable and valid under applicable Legal Requirement, but if any
provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable by or invalid under
applicable Legal Requirement, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such unenforceability or invalidity, without invalidating the
remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. 

  

11E. _No Strict Construction_. Each of Buyer, the Sellers, the Company and
the Representative confirm that it and its respective counsel have reviewed,
negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and
understanding of the parties hereto and the language used in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express
their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied
against any Person. 

  

11F. _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement and in the Disclosure

used. 

  

11G. _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, the Disclosure Letters and any

admission or agreement that a violation, right of termination, default,
liability or other obligation of any kind exists with respect to any item,
nor shall it be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that
such information is material to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of

Further, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor

such items or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Seller Disclosure Letter or the Company Disclosure Letter is or is not in the
ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. Prior to the
Closing, the Sellers and the Company shall have the right from time to time
to supplement, modify or update the Seller Disclosure Letter and the Company
Disclosure Letter but only to the extent relating to facts, events
or circumstances arising out of developments after the date of this
Agreement. No such supplement, modification or update shall prohibit, limit
or otherwise affect Buyers right to indemnification hereunder, be taken into
account in determining whether the condition set forth in _Section 2B(i)_ is
satisfied or deemed to prevent or cure a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder with respect to the
information disclosed in such supplement, modification or update. 

   

(ii) The inclusion of information in the Buyer Disclosure Letter shall not be

dollar amount in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Buyer Disclosure
Letter is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or
the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Person
shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion
of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included
in the Buyer Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Further, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the

other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business,
and no Person shall use the fact of setting forth or the inclusion of any
such items or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Buyer Disclosure Letter is or is not in the ordinary course of business for
purposes of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have the right
from time to time to supplement, modify or update the Buyer Disclosure Letter
but only to the extent relating to facts, events or circumstances arising out
of developments after the date of this Agreement by providing written notice
to the Representative that it is exercising such right pursuant to this
_Section 11H(ii)_. No such supplement, modification or update shall
prohibit, limit or otherwise affect Sellers right to indemnification
hereunder, be taken into account in determining whether the condition set

own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts), and
that Buyer shall have no claim against any Seller Party or any other Person
with respect thereto. Accordingly, neither the Company nor any Seller
Party makes any representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
forecasts), and Buyer has not relied thereon.
