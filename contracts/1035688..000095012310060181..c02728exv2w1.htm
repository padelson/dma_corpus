necessary to reflect any resolution by the Representative and Buyer and any final resolution
made by the Arbiter in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;1D(ii)</U>. During the 30&nbsp;days
immediately following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement or such longer period as the
Representative and Buyer may agree in writing, the Representative and Buyer shall seek in
good faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect to any
matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and all such discussions related thereto
shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and the Representative) be governed by Rule&nbsp;408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule. At the end of such
30-day period, the Representative and Buyer shall submit to KPMG LLP (the &#147;<U>Arbiter</U>&#148;)
for review and resolution of any and all matters (but only such matters) which remain in
dispute and which were included in the Notice of Disagreement, and if KPMG LLP is unwilling
or unable to act in such capacity (or is conflicted), then the Representative and Buyer
shall attempt to mutually agree on who shall serve as the Arbiter, and if the Representative
and Buyer cannot agree upon the Arbiter within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days after KPMG LLP has
given notice that it will not serve as Arbiter, then the Representative and Buyer shall each
select, within five days of the end of such 10-day period, a nationally recognized
consulting or accounting firm with expertise in financial analysis and the firm selected by
the Representative and the firm selected by Buyer shall mutually and promptly (and in any
event within five days) select a third nationally recognized consulting or accounting firm
with expertise in financial analysis to serve as the Arbiter. Buyer and the Representative
shall instruct the Arbiter to, and the Arbiter shall, make a final determination of the
items included in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (to the extent such
amounts are in dispute) in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in this
Agreement. Buyer and the Representative will cooperate (and Buyer shall cause the Company to
cooperate) with the Arbiter during the term of its engagement. Buyer and the Representative
shall instruct the Arbiter not to, and the Arbiter shall not, assign a value to any item in
dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or
the Representative, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item
assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other hand. Buyer and the
Representative shall also instruct the Arbiter to, and the Arbiter shall, make its
determination based solely on presentations by Buyer and the Representative that are in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (<U>i.e.</U>, not
on the basis of an independent review). The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and
the resulting calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness and the
Purchase Price resulting therefrom shall become final and binding on the parties hereto on
the date the Arbiter delivers its final resolution in writing to Buyer and the
Representative (which final resolution shall be requested by the terms of the engagement
with the Arbiter to be not more than 30&nbsp;days from the date of such engagement and no more
than 10 Business Days from the final submission of information and testimony by Buyer and
Representative to the Arbiter), and such resolution by the Arbiter shall not be subject to
court review or otherwise appealable but shall be enforceable by a court of competent
jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the Arbiter pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;1D(ii)</U>
shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Representative, on the other hand, based
upon the percentage which the aggregate portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
party bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by such party.

Sellers with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Representative in such capacity
