 (a) Each share (or fraction of a share) of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time (other than any Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b) and 

   ##### 

  

    

any Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 3.5(b))) shall be converted into
the right to receive one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share (or an equal
fraction of a share, if applicable) of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of New Diamond (the " _New Diamond Shares_ "). 

  

 (b) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof. 

  

 (c) Each New Diamond Share held by the Company immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time shall be canceled. 

  

 (d) Each share of common stock of New Diamond Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time shall be converted into one share of Common Stock of the Company as the surviving corporation of the Diamond Merger. 

  

 SECTION 3.2 _Effect of the Emerald Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Emerald Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, New Diamond or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) Each New Diamond Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.2(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration from Parent. 

  

 (b) Each New Diamond Share held in the treasury of New Diamond, or owned by Parent, the Company, New Diamond or any wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company, Parent or New Diamond, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Each share of common stock of Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 SECTION 3.3 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity Awards_. Prior to the Initial Effective Time, the Company and New Diamond, and the Company Board of Directors and the New Diamond Board of Directors, as applicable, shall take all action necessary, including a resolution of such boards (or a committee thereof), such that: 

  

 (a) Each Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time shall be assumed by New Diamond at the Initial Effective Time, and shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (and shall have the same date of grant) as were applicable under the Stock Plans and any applicable agreements thereunder immediately before the Initial Effective Time, except that each Option will be exercisable for a number of New Diamond Shares equal to the number of Company Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, the term "Option" after the Initial Effective Time shall mean an option to purchase New Diamond Shares pursuant to any of the Stock Plans, as assumed by New Diamond at the Initial Effective Time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, and that is not held by a New Diamond Employee shall be canceled by New Diamond, and the holder of such Option shall receive, in full settlement thereof, an amount of cash (the " _Cash-Out Amount_ "), without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of New Diamond Shares subject to such Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the sum of (x) (A) the number of Parent Shares represented by the Stock Consideration multiplied by (B) the Average Closing Price plus (y) the Cash Consideration (such sum, the " _Cash-Out Price_ ") over the exercise price per New Diamond Share subject to such Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment to the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent), less applicable Taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the holder of such Option is a non-employee director of New Diamond, such holder shall not receive the full Cash-Out Amount in cash, but shall instead receive (x) an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the product of (1) the Cash-Out Amount multiplied by (2) a fraction (the " _Cash Fraction_ "), the numerator of which is the Cash Consideration and the denominator of which is the sum of (a) the Cash Consideration plus (b) the product of (i) the Stock Consideration multiplied by (ii) the Average Closing Price, and (y) a number of Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest share) equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the product of (1) the Cash-Out Amount multiplied by (2) (a) 1.0 minus (b) the Cash Fraction, and the denominator of which is the Average Closing Price. 

  

 (c) Each Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a New Diamond Employee (whether or not vested or exercisable) shall be assumed by Parent at the Effective Time. To the extent permitted under the Stock Plans, all such outstanding Options shall accelerate and become immediately exercisable in connection with the Mergers in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans and any applicable agreements thereunder. Except for the acceleration of the Options in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans and any applicable agreements thereunder, at the Effective Time, each Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement (an " _Adjusted Option_ ") shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Stock Plans and any applicable agreements thereunder immediately before the Initial Effective Time, except that (i) each Adjusted Option will be exercisable for that number of Parent Shares (rounded up or down to the nearest share, and rounded up in the case of half a share) equal to the product of (x) the number of New Diamond Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the sum of (A) the Stock Consideration, plus (B) (1) the Cash Consideration divided by (2) the Average Closing Price, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the Parent Shares issuable upon exercise of such Adjusted Option will be equal to the quotient (rounded up or down to the nearest cent) determined by dividing (x) the per share exercise price of such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the sum of (A) the Stock Consideration plus (B) (1) the Cash Consideration, divided by (2) the Average Closing Price. The date of grant of each Adjusted Option will be the date on which the corresponding Option was granted. In the event that the holder of an Adjusted Option would be precluded by applicable securities laws from disposing of Parent Shares acquired upon exercise of such option during the 60-day period beginning on the Closing Date, Parent will (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) make available a "cashless exercise" opportunity to such holder during such period unless such cashless exercise would result in an accounting impact for Parent that is both adverse to Parent and likely to continue beyond the 60-day period beginning on the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Each Stock Unit that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time shall be assumed by New Diamond at the Initial Effective Time, and shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately before the Initial Effective Time, except that each Stock Unit will become a right to receive a number of New Diamond Shares equal to the number of Company Shares that would be received for such Stock Unit immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time. Each Stock Unit that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Stock Units granted pursuant to the exception provided in Section 6.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter), whether or not vested, will, as of the Effective Time, entitle the holder thereof to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately before the Effective Time, provided that each holder of a Stock Unit that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, may elect, prior to the Effective Time, to receive payment of such Stock Unit upon the earlier of (1) the existing payment date under the current terms of the Stock Units (subject to any change in the existing payment date that is required to comply with Section 409A of the Code) or (2) the later of (x) the Effective Time or (y) January 1, 2007. The Company may adopt such amendments to the Stock Units as it deems necessary or appropriate to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Initial Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing treatment in this Section 3.3 to the extent such treatment is not expressly provided for by the terms of the applicable equity compensation plans and related award agreements. All payments under this Section 3.3 shall be made no later than five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date. 

  

 (f) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Shares for delivery upon exercise of Adjusted Options pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 3.3(c). As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Parent Shares subject to the Adjusted Options to be covered by an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any Adjusted Options remain outstanding. In addition, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Shares subject to the Adjusted Options to be listed on the NYSE. 

  

 (g) The parties will make good faith efforts to make equitable adjustments if necessary to ensure that the provisions of this Section 3.3 comply with Section 409A of the Code. 

  

 SECTION 3.4 _Adjustment of Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, (a) between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the issued and outstanding Company Shares (prior to the Initial Effective Time) or New Diamond Shares (after the Initial Effective Time), or the issued and outstanding Parent Shares, shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (other than dividend equivalents paid to members of the Company Board of Directors under the terms of Stock Units outstanding on the date hereof), reclassification, or redenomination, or (b) at the Initial Effective Time, the Companys representation and warranties in Section 4.5 (Capitalization of the Company) or Parents 

   ##### 

  

    

representations and warranties in Section 5.5 (Capitalization) are not true in
any non-de minimis respect relating to the number of fully diluted shares
outstanding, then the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Cash-Out Price and
any other dependent items (1) shall be appropriately adjusted, in the case of
(a) above, to provide to the holders of New Diamond Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action and as so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share
Merger Consideration, the Cash-Out Price or other dependent item, subject to
further adjustment in accordance with this sentence, and/or (2) shall be
appropriately adjusted, in the case of (b) above, to provide to New Diamond
and Parent and their respective stockholders the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement assuming such representations and warranties
are true and correct in all such respects as written and as so adjusted shall
be the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Cash-Out Price or other dependent
item, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence. 

  

 SECTION 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) No appraisal rights shall be available to holders of New Diamond Shares in connection with the Emerald Merger. 

  

 (b) In the event the Charter Amendment is approved and the Effective Time occurs, Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time and which are held by holders of Company Shares who have not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and who have properly taken the steps required in order to demand and perfect their rights to appraisal in connection with the Diamond Merger, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive New Diamond shares in accordance with Section 3.1(a), and the holders thereof instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL and the restated certificate of incorporation of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholders Company Shares in respect of which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Initial Effective Time, into New Diamond Shares in accordance with Section 3.1(a) (which New Diamond Shares shall be converted into the Per Share Merger Consideration in the Emerald Merger in accordance with Section 3.2(a)). In the event the Charter Amendment is not approved or the Effective Time does not occur, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Company Shares in connection with the Diamond Merger. 

  

 (c) Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice received by Company of the intent of any holder of Company Shares to demand the fair value of any Company Shares in the Diamond Merger, any written demand for appraisal, any withdrawals thereof and any instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of dissenters rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an order, decree, ruling or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction, make any payment with respect to any such exercise of dissenters rights or offer to settle or settle any such rights. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) The parties shall cooperate to take any reasonable steps requested by another party that may be necessary to (i) provide appraisal rights to holders of Company Shares as contemplated by Section 3.5(b), and (ii) ensure that no appraisal rights are available in connection with the Emerald Merger. 

  

 SECTION 3.6 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) Following the date of this Agreement and in any event not less than three Business Days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the stockholders of the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as Paying Agent in connection with the Mergers (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will cause to be deposited in trust with the Paying Agent the aggregate consideration to which stockholders of the Company are contemplated to become entitled under this Article III. Until used for that purpose, the portion of such aggregate consideration consisting of cash shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation; _provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to former stockholders of New Diamond, and Parent shall promptly provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide, additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the former stockholders of New Diamond in the amount of any shortfall in funds payable to the former stockholders of New Diamond pursuant to this Article III. 

  

 (b) From and after the Initial Effective Time, (i) each stock certificate which immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time represented Company Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed to represent an equal number of New Diamond Shares (each such stock certificate, a " _Certificate_ "), and (ii) each holder of record of Company Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time shall be deemed to be a holder of record of the same number of New Diamond Shares. 

  

 (c) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two Business Days following the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was a record holder of New Diamond Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose New Diamond Shares were converted pursuant to this Article III into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, (i) a form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in order to receive payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in customary form), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration. When the Paying Agent receives a Certificate, together with a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the holder of the New Diamond Shares represented by the Certificate, or as otherwise directed in the letter of transmittal, (A) a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration into 

   ##### 

  

    

which all of the New Diamond Shares represented by such Certificate shall
have been converted pursuant to the Emerald Merger, (B) a certificate
representing that number of whole Parent Shares into which the New Diamond
Shares represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to
the Emerald Merger, (C) any cash in lieu of a fractional Parent Share to
which such holder shall be entitled pursuant to Section 3.6(h), and (D) any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder shall be entitled
pursuant to Section 3.6(i). Any payment hereunder shall be less any required
Tax withholdings in accordance with Section 3.6(d) below, and the Certificate
shall be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Per Share
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of Certificates. If payment
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered must be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer, and the Person who surrenders the Certificate must
provide funds for payment of any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
surrendered Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. After the
Effective Time, a Certificate shall represent only the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of the New Diamond Shares
represented by such Certificate, without any interest thereon. 

  

 (d) The Paying Agent may withhold from the sum payable to any Person as a result of the Emerald Merger, and pay to the appropriate Taxing Authorities, any amounts that the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation may be required (or may reasonably believe it is required) to withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any sum that is withheld and paid to a Taxing Authority as permitted by this Section will be deemed to have been paid to the Person from whom it is withheld. 

  

 (e) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the reasonable replacement requirements established by the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the New Diamond Shares represented by the Certificate pursuant to this Article III. 

  

 (f) At any time which is more than 180 days after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds and shares which had been deposited with the Paying Agent and have not been disbursed in accordance with this Article III (including interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of the funds made available to it), and after the funds and shares have been delivered to Parent, Persons entitled to payment in accordance with this Article III shall be entitled to look solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates held by them, without any interest thereon. Any Per Share Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Neither the Surviving Corporation, Parent nor the Paying Agent will be liable to any Person entitled to payment under this Article III for any consideration which is properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of New Diamond shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of New Diamond Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Certificates presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of the New Diamond Shares represented thereby. 

  

 (h) No certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Shares will be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution of Parent will relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of New Diamond Shares converted pursuant to the Emerald Merger who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Share (after taking into account all New Diamond Shares held at the Effective Time by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and in accordance with Section 3.6(i), an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such former holder would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Average Closing Price. 

  

 (i) No cash payment in lieu of fractional shares and no dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to any holder of an unsurrendered Certificate until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar Laws, following the surrender of any such Certificate in accordance herewith, there will be paid to the holder of the New Diamond Shares represented by such Certificate or as otherwise directed by the related letter of transmittal, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional Parent Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.6(h) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to whole Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.6(c), and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole Parent Shares. Pending such payment, all such amounts shall be deposited by Parent, as promptly as practicable, with the Paying Agent, to be held in trust by the Paying Agent for the benefit of the applicable holders of unsurrendered Certificates. 

  

 (j) Holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent stockholders the number of whole Parent Shares the holder of such Certificates would be entitled to receive in the Emerald Merger, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates.

 SECTION 4.7 _SEC Reports; Financial Information_. 

  

 (a) The Company has timely filed or furnished, as applicable, all forms, reports, statements, certifications and other documents (including all exhibits, supplements and amendments thereto) required to be filed or furnished by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") since January 1, 2003 (collectively, with any amendments thereto, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "), each of which, including any financial statements or schedules included therein, as finally amended prior to the date hereof, has complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, each as in effect on the date so filed. None of the Company SEC Reports contained, when filed 

   ##### 

  

    

as finally amended prior to the date hereof, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or
incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each of (i) the consolidated balance sheets included in
the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes and schedules) was
prepared in accordance with GAAP in all material respects applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods covered and fairly presents, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and (ii) the related
consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity
included in the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) were prepared in accordance with GAAP in all material respects
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered and fairly
present, in all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the periods indicated
(subject, in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii), to normal and/or
recurring year-end adjustments and the absence of full footnote disclosure in
the case of unaudited financial statements). 

  

 (b) Attached hereto are (i) unaudited selected results of operations data for each of the New Diamond Business, the Standalone Drug Business and the Retained Business for the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2004, the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2005 and the 39 weeks ended November 3, 2005 (collectively, the " _Separate Operations Data_ ," attached hereto as _Exhibit H_) and (ii) unaudited selected balance sheet data for the Company and each of the Companys operating regions as of February 3, 2005 (the " _Separate Balance Sheet Data_ ," attached hereto as  _Exhibit I_).

Such source books, records and financial reports were prepared by the Company in the ordinary course of its business, are accurate in all material respects and were subject to the Companys internal controls.

The Separate Balance Sheet Data and the Separate Operations Data reconcile to the Companys historical financial statements filed with the SEC and, in the Companys opinion, present fairly, in all material respects, the information presented in the Separate Balance Sheet Data and the Separate Operations Data, respectively. Subject to the changes in accounting principles and methodologies effected by the Company as described in the Company SEC Reports, the accounting principles and methodologies used in the preparation of the Separate Operations Data were applied on a consistent basis, in all material respects, for each of the periods presented therein. 

  

 (c) The Company has designed and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company (i) has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 

   ##### 

  

    

specified in the SECs rules and forms, and (ii) has disclosed and reported,
based on its most recent evaluation of its internal control over financial
reporting prior to the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board of Directors (A) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of its
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent complete
and correct copies of the Companys final report to the audit committee of
the Company Board of Directors for fiscal 2004 and all subsequent regular
quarterly updates, in each case in respect of the matters described in clause
(ii) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 SECTION 4.8 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any liabilities, claims or indebtedness of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, whether due or to become due, in each case, that are required by GAAP to be accrued, reserved against, or disclosed in a consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto, except liabilities that (i) are accrued or reserved against in the financial statements included in the Company Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q most recently filed prior to the date hereof or are disclosed in the notes thereto, (ii) were incurred in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice since the date of the most recent balance sheet included in the most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed by the Company with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Balance Sheet Date_ ") and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, (A) a Company Material Adverse Effect or (B) a Material Adverse Effect as that term is defined in the Standalone Drug Sale Agreement, (iii) are incurred pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) have been discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or (v) were incurred outside the ordinary course of business since the Company Balance Sheet Date, but which are, and would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, immaterial in amount or nature.

   ##### 

  

    

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) under which

Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.13, the action of the Company Board of Directors in approving this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated hereby) is sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated hereby) the restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL.

Parent and New Diamond shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of New Diamond Shares in the Diamond Merger and Parent Shares in the Emerald Merger, as applicable, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company Shares as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. 

  

 (c) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by New Diamond or Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/ Prospectus will be made by the Company or Parent, in each case, without providing the other party and its respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. 

  

 (d) Each of the parties agrees that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form 

   ##### 

  

 

S-4 will, at the date such document is first mailed to the stockholders of
the relevant party and at the time of such partys meeting of stockholders
relating to the Mergers, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading. For purposes of the foregoing, it
is understood and agreed that information concerning or related to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary will be deemed to have been supplied by the
Company and information concerning or related to Parent or Acquisition Sub
will be deemed to have been supplied by Parent. 

   

 (e) Each of Parent and the Company agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 which shall have become false or misleading. The parties shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify each other of the receipt of any comments from or other correspondence with the SEC staff with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 or for additional information (and promptly deliver a copy of such comments, correspondence or request to each other).

 SECTION 6.4 _Access to Information_. 

  

 (a) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms and the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, subject to reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time upon advice of counsel respecting applicable Law or the Confidentiality Agreements, afford representatives of Parent, following notice from Parent to the Company in accordance with this Section 6.4(a), reasonable access during normal business hours to all properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments and records and such financial (including all working papers) and operating data of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and all other information concerning its business, properties, personnel, vendors, landlords/sublandlords, tenants, licensees and franchisees as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its representatives shall (i) contact or have any discussions with any of the Companys employees, agents, or representatives, unless in each case Parent obtains the prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) contact or have any discussions with any of the vendors, landlords/sublandlords, tenants/subtenants, licensees or franchisees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, unless in each case Parent obtains the prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (iii) damage any property or any portion thereof, or (iv) perform any onsite procedure or investigation (including any onsite environmental investigation or study) without the Companys prior written consent. Parent shall schedule and coordinate all 

   ##### 

  

 

inspections with the Company and shall give the Company at least three
Business Days prior written notice thereof, setting forth the inspection or
materials that Parent or its representatives intend to conduct. The Company
shall be entitled to have representatives present at all times during
any such inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or contravene any
Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.
All information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.4(a) shall continue to be
governed by the Confidentiality Agreements. 

   

 (b) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms and the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause each Parent Subsidiary to, subject to reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time upon advice of counsel respecting applicable Law, afford representatives of the Company, following notice from Company to the Parent in accordance with this Section 6.4(b), reasonable access during normal business hours to all properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments and records and such financial (including all working papers) and operating data of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and all other information concerning its business, properties, personnel, vendors, landlords/sublandlords, tenants, licensees and franchisees as the Company may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its representatives shall (i) contact or have any discussions with any of Parents or the Parent Subsidiaries employees, agents, or representatives, unless in each case the Company obtains the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) contact or have any discussions with any of the vendors, landlords/sublandlords, tenants/subtenants, licensees or franchisees of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries, unless in each case the Company obtains the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (iii) damage any property or any portion thereof, or (iv) perform any onsite procedure or investigation (including any onsite environmental investigation or study) without Parents prior written consent. The Company shall schedule and coordinate all inspections with Parent and shall give Parent at least three Business Days prior written notice thereof, setting forth the inspection or materials that the Company or its representatives intend to conduct. Parent shall be entitled to have representatives present at all times during any such inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company will keep confidential all non-public information provided to it pursuant to this Section 6.4(b), except for disclosures required by applicable Law. 

  

 SECTION 6.5 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Company and Parent shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct its and its Subsidiaries directors, officers, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other representatives not to, (A) directly or indirectly, initiate or solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal or offer with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer, merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving it or any proposal or offer 

   ##### 

  

 

to acquire in any manner 20% or more of its Equity Interests, or the assets,
securities or other ownership interests of or in it or any Subsidiary
representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets, revenues or earnings of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or of the Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, other than the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements and the Standalone Drug Sale Agreement (any such
proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ ") or (B) directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations or
discussions concerning, or provide any confidential information or data
to, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal or execute or enter into
any agreement, understanding, letter of intent or arrangement with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement described
below). Subject to Section 6.5(b), neither the Company nor Parent, nor the
Company Board of Directors nor the Parent Board of Directors (each, a " _Board
of Directors_ ") nor any committee thereof shall recommend to its
stockholders any Acquisition Proposal or approve any agreement with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
in this Agreement shall prevent either of the Company or Parent or its Board
of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or from making any other legally required disclosure to stockholders with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal (provided that neither the Company nor the
Parent nor the Board of Directors thereof may recommend any
Acquisition Proposal unless permitted by Section 6.5(b) below and may not
fail to include or make, or withdraw, modify or change in a manner adverse to
the other party all or any portion of, the Company Board Recommendation or
Parent Board Recommendation, as the case may be, unless permitted by Section
6.2 (in which case Parent or the Company shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.1(e)(ii) or Section 8.1(d)(ii), as
applicable), and provided further that, notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to its stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not be
considered a failure to make, or a withdrawal, modification or change in any
manner adverse to the other party of, all or a portion of the Company Board
Recommendation or the Parent Board Recommendation, as applicable) or (ii) (A)
prior to obtaining the requisite vote of its stockholders at the
Company Stockholders Meeting, in the case of a Company Proposal, providing
access to its properties, books and records and providing information or data
in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made a bona fide,
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that does not involve an intentional,
material breach of this Section 6.5(a), if (1) the Board of Directors
receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreements (except for such changes specifically
necessary in order for such party to be able to comply with its obligations
under this Agreement and it being understood that either party may enter into
a confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision or with a
standstill provision less favorable to it if it waives or similarly
modifies the standstill provision in the relevant Confidentiality Agreement
in favor of the other party), and (2) in the case of a Parent Proposal, such
Parent Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Qualifying Parent
Proposal, or (B) prior to obtaining  the requisite vote of its stockholders
at the Company Stockholders Meeting, in the case of a Company Proposal,
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made a
bona fide unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that does not involve an
intentional, material breach of this Section 6.5(a) and, in addition, in the
case of a Parent Proposal, such Parent Proposal is a Qualifying Parent
Proposal, if and only to the extent, in the case of a Company Proposal, that
prior to taking any of the 

     ##### 

  

    

actions set forth in clauses (A) or (B) of clause (ii), the Company Board of
Directors shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal from the
Person that made the applicable Acquisition Proposal, and the Company shall
have informed Parent promptly following (and in no event later than 24 hours
after) the taking by it of any such action. A " _Superior Proposal_ " means,
with respect to a Company Proposal, an Acquisition Proposal (with all
percentages included in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal," increased
to 50% for purposes of this definition) that the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith (taking into account such factors as it deems
appropriate, including any legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal) is reasonably capable of being
consummated and, if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable
to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) If either the Company Board of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors determines in good faith, in response to an Acquisition Proposal, that such proposal is a Superior Proposal (in the case of a Company Proposal) or a Qualifying Parent Proposal (in the case of a Parent Proposal), the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall notify the other party in writing of such determination promptly following (and in no event later than 24 hours after) the making of such determination. Prior to obtaining the requisite vote of its stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting, in the case of a Company Proposal, the Company Board of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors, as the case may be, may approve or recommend such Superior Proposal or Qualifying Parent Proposal, as the case may be, to its stockholders and enter into any agreement, understanding, letter of intent or arrangement with respect to such Superior Proposal or Qualifying Parent Proposal, as applicable, and the Company may terminate this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not recommend any such Superior Proposal to its stockholders, enter into any definitive agreement providing for any such Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this sentence (and any purported termination pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no force or effect), unless and until (1) it has given Parent prior written notice of its intention to enter into such agreement at least two Business Days before doing so, (2) the Company Board of Directors has considered in good faith any proposed changes to this Agreement proposed by Parent, (3) the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such recommendation or enter into such agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (4) prior to entering into such agreement, it has terminated this Agreement, and (5) concurrently with such termination pursuant to this Section 6.5(b), the Company pays to Parent the Company Termination Fee (as defined below) payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b). 

  

 (c) Each of the Company and Parent shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each of the Company and Parent also shall, if it has not already done so, promptly request, to the extent it has a contractual right to do so, that each Person, if any, that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement within the 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential information or data heretofore furnished to it by or on behalf of the Company or Parent, as the case may be. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after receipt of an Acquisition Proposal) notify (which notice shall be provided orally and in writing and shall identify the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and set forth in reasonable detail its material terms and conditions) the other party after receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and thereafter shall keep the other party reasonably informed of the status and material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers. Each of the Company and Parent shall make available to the other party (to the extent it has not already done so) all material non-public information made available to any Person making an Acquisition Proposal at substantially the same time and in substantially the same form as it provides it to such other Person. 

  

 SECTION 6.6 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company and Parent will use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary or desirable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to: (i) prepare, as soon as practicable, all filings and other presentations in connection with seeking any regulatory approval, exemption or other authorization from any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) prosecute such filings and other presentations with diligence; and (iii) oppose any objections to, appeals from or petitions to reconsider or reopen any such approval by Persons not party to this Agreement. Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to facilitate obtaining any final order or orders approving such transactions, consistent with this Agreement and/or to remove any impediment to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to furnish all information in connection with the approvals of or filings with any Governmental Authority and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information in connection with any such requirements imposed upon Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to Section 6.6(c), Parent will use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, and to remove any impediment imposed by any Governmental Authority to allow the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Company will each advise the other party promptly of any material communication received by such party or any of its Affiliates from the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, any state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) such party proposes to make or enter into with the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, any state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Company will each consult with the other in advance of any material meetings with the Federal Trade Commission. 

  

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of Sections 6.6(a) and (b), each of Parent and Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and thereafter make any other required submissions with respect to the transactions contemplated 

   ##### 

  

 

hereby under the HSR Act and to take all other appropriate actions reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall promptly take, in order to consummate the Transactions, all actions necessary (i) to secure the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act (the " _HSR Clearance_ ") and/or to resolve any objections asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions under any antitrust Law or the Federal Trade Commission Act (each, an " _Objection_ "), and (ii) to prevent the entry of, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, judgment, injunction or other order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the Transactions, in each case including (A) executing settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any such party and (B) selling, divesting or otherwise conveying particular assets or categories of assets or businesses of Parent and its Affiliates and/or constituting part of the New Diamond Assets (as such term is defined in the Separation Agreement) or New Diamond Business. Such efforts shall include, in addition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Cub Sale Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements referred to therein, taking all additional actions contemplated by the preceding sentence, subject only to a limitation that those additional actions not result in a divestiture of additional assets or businesses that, in the aggregate, produce annual revenues in excess of $4 billion. Parent shall respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as practicable any Objections that are raised. No actions taken pursuant to this Section 6.6(d) shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.6 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 so long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.6. 

  

 (f) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Shares issuable to New Diamonds stockholders as contemplated by this Agreement to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Closing Date. The Company and New Diamond shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the New Diamond Shares issuable to the Companys stockholders in the Diamond Merger as contemplated by this Agreement to be approved for listing on a national securities exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Initial Effective Time. 

  

 (g) The Company shall deliver to Parent prior to the Closing Date a letter identifying all Persons who are, at the time this Agreement is submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the Company, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Act. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each such Person to deliver to Parent on or prior to the Closing Date a written affiliate letter agreement in a form to be agreed by the parties. 

  

 (h) The Company shall provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the respective officers, 

   #####

the foregoing, the Company shall (1) take all necessary corporate action to
consummate the Debt and Purchase Contract Assumption immediately prior to

 SECTION 6.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee, officer or director may have under any employment agreement or Company Plan or under the Companys or New Diamonds certificate of incorporation or by-laws, after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each person who, as of the Effective Time, is a present or former officer or director of the Company, New Diamond or any Company Subsidiary or served as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) at any time maintained or contributed to by the Company, New Diamond or any Company Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Directors and Officers_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions taken (or failure to take action) by any of them in their capacities as officers, directors or fiduciaries at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent 

   ##### 

  

 

permitted under applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, advance the cost of any expenses incurred by each Indemnified
Director and Officer in the defense of any claim, demand, action, suit,
proceeding, inquiry or investigation arising out of such Indemnified Director
or Officers service as a director, officer or fiduciary within three
Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified
Director or Officer of a request therefor; provided only that any Person to
whom expenses are to be advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the
extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advances if it is determined that
such person is not entitled to indemnification in a final,
nonappealable determination by a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or
threatened claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation

The resolutions adopted by the Company Board of Directors on October 7, 2005 relating to the indemnification of certain benefit plan fiduciaries, which resolutions are set forth in Section 6.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall continue in effect and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Fiduciary (as such term is defined therein) and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and pay any and all expenses incurred by each Fiduciary in accordance with the term of such resolutions and otherwise honor and comply with the provisions of such resolutions. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and/or New Diamond shall (and if it is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to) obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies (providing only for the Side A coverage for Indemnified Directors and Officers where the existing policies also include Side B coverage for the Company) with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby),  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend for such policies an amount in excess of the amounts set forth in Section 6.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter; and, provided further that if the premiums of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" 

   ##### 

  

 

insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six years from the Effective Time the
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance in place as of the date hereof covering the Indemnified
Directors and Officers with benefits and levels of coverage at least as
favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance for such six-year
period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof covering the
Indemnified Directors and Officers; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Parent or Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies an annual premium amount in excess of the amounts set forth in
Section 6.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter; and, provided further that
if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by the Company or any Company Subsidiary set forth in
Section 6.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Directors and Officers and their respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Director or Officer is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. 

  

 (e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets as an entirety in one or a series of related transactions to any Person(s), then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or such Persons(s), as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8; _provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be relieved from such obligation. In addition, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Parent or Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.8. 

  

 SECTION 6.9 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of which has been agreed to by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, New Diamond, and New Diamond Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby, except to the extent public disclosure is required by applicable Law or the requirements of the NYSE or the PCX, in which case the issuing party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such release or making any such public statement.

 SECTION 6.10 _Cooperation_. (a) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Financing pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments. Parent shall notify the Company if at any time prior to the Closing Date the Financing Commitment shall expire or be terminated, modified or amended for any reason.

 SECTION 6.13 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters; Section 16_. 

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2007 (the " _Benefits Continuation Period_ "), to maintain the severance-related provisions of existing Company Plans not subject to termination pursuant to the express terms hereof and to provide 100% of the severance payments and benefits required thereunder to be provided to any Current Employee whose employment is terminated during that period. For purposes of this Section 6.13 only, the term "Company Employee" shall be deemed to refer to any current, former or retired employee, officer, consultant, independent contractor or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, excluding employees of the Standalone Drug Business and the Retained Business. 

  

 (b) The Company shall allow each participant in the Deferred Compensation Plans to elect, prior to the Effective Time, to receive his or her account balances (in the case of account balance plans) and the present value of all accrued benefits (in the case of non-account balance plans, with the present value in the case of benefits payable pursuant to an individual agreement being determined using the assumptions required to be used in such agreement and in all other cases being determined by using the average yield to maturity for 30-year US Government Bonds and the unloaded 94 GAR mortality rates, blended 50% male and 50% female, projected to 2002), upon the earlier of (1) the existing payment date under the current terms relating to such deferred compensation (subject to any change in the existing payment date that is required to comply with Section 409A of the Code) or (2) the later of (x) the Effective Time or (y) January 1, 2007. The Company may adopt such amendments to the Deferred Compensation Plans as it deems necessary or appropriate to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (c) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary at the Effective Time (" _Current Employee_ ") may have under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for the Benefits Continuation Period, to maintain for any Current Employees (i) salary or hourly wage rate, commissions and target cash bonus opportunities under annual and long-term incentive programs (collectively, " _Compensation_ "), that in the aggregate are no less favorable than, and (ii) benefits provided 

   ##### 

  

 

under Company Plans (other than those covered by (i) above) that in the
aggregate are no less favorable than, the Compensation and benefits
maintained for and provided to such Current Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , subject to the foregoing, that
nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any Company
Plan or interfere with the Surviving Corporations right or obligation to
make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law. Nothing in
this Section 6.13 shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Current
Employee at any time. 

   

 (d) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Current Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accruals, except for vacation and severance, if applicable, under the Company Plans), under any employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Current Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Company Employees service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized under the Company Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that no such credit shall be granted to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent that it is not similarly granted to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), the Parent or its Subsidiaries shall (i) cause to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations to the extent waived or satisfied under the applicable Company Plan in which the Current Employee participates immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) give effect, for the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Current Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and all of its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms (including any right to amend or terminate), (i) each existing employment, change in control, severance and termination plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any officer, director or employee of that company, and (ii) bonus plans or programs, bonus deferral plans, vested and accrued benefits under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and similar employment compensation and benefit arrangements and agreements in effect as of the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the annual bonus for fiscal year 2005 is not yet paid to participants at the Effective Time, any participant who was employed by the Company at the end of fiscal year 2005 will be entitled to a bonus if earned pursuant to the 2005 bonus program, regardless of whether such participant is employed at the time of the payment of 2005 bonuses. 

  

 (f) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other dispositions of Equity Interests of the Company (including derivative securities), in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be approved by the Company Board of Directors or a committee of two or more Non- 

   ##### 

  

 

Employee Directors of the Company (as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) and (ii) Parent shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any
other acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative
securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to
be approved by Parent Board of Directors or a committee of two or more Non-
Employee Directors of Parent (as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act). Such approvals shall specify: (A) the
name of each officer or director, (B) the number of securities to be disposed
of or acquired for each named person, and (C) that the approval is granted
for purposes of exempting the transaction under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange
Act. 

   

 (g) The parties hereto will treat the consummation of the Transactions and the Standalone Drug Sale, both individually and collectively, and regardless of the order in which they actually occur, as a "change in control," "change of control" or similar event under each of the Company Plans (to the extent such Company Plans contain provisions relating to "change in control," "change of control" or similar event). 

  

 (h) The parties will make good faith efforts to make equitable adjustments if necessary to ensure that the provisions of this Section 6.13 comply with Section 409A of the Code. 

  

 (i) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.7, nothing in this Section 6.13, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any employee or service provider of Parent, the Company, or their respective Subsidiaries any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever. 

  

 SECTION 6.14 _Board Representation_. Parent shall take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to cause, effective immediately following the Effective Time, the number of directors comprising the Parent Board of Directors to be no more than fourteen (14) and for there to be three (3) vacancies on such board.

In furtherance thereto, Parent shall refer the names of three or more mutually agreeable nominees to the Director Affairs Committee of the Parent Board of Directors for nomination to fill such vacancies immediately following the Effective Time and to serve on the Parent Board of Directors, one in each of the three classes of the Parent Board of Directors.

 SECTION 6.16 _Coordination of Dividends_. From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall coordinate with each other regarding the declaration and payment of dividends in respect of the Company Shares and the Parent Shares and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of Company Shares or Parent Shares shall not receive two dividends, or fail 

   ##### 

  

 

to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter, including the
quarter in which the Effective Time occurs, with respect to their Company
Shares or Parent Shares, as the case may be. New Diamond and New Diamond
Merger Sub shall not declare or pay any dividends in respect of their Common
Stock. 

   

 SECTION 6.17 _The Diamond Reorganization_. The parties acknowledge and agree that they desire and intend to (i) cause the Diamond Merger and the Diamond LLC Conversion, taken together (the " _Diamond Reorganization_ "), to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code (an " _F Reorg_ "), (ii) treat the Retained Business Purchase (other than the purchase of Lucky Stores, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Lucky Delaware_ ") and its Subsidiaries) and the Standalone Drug Sale as purchases of assets for federal income Tax purposes, (iii) treat the purchase of Lucky Delaware as a purchase of stock for federal income Tax purposes and (iv) effect the Separation in a manner that does not result in any gain, including any deferred intercompany gain, for federal income Tax purposes (other than with respect to the distribution of certain New Diamond Assets from Lucky Delaware and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Separation Agreement). The Company shall, and shall cause New Diamond to, (x) use best efforts to cause the Diamond Reorganization to qualify as an F Reorg, (y) consult with Parent prior to taking any action that could affect the qualification of the Diamond Reorganization as an F Reorg and take, or refrain from taking, any actions reasonably requested by Emerald in order to qualify the Diamond Reorganization as an F Reorg and (z) consult with Parent prior to taking any action in connection with the Separation, the Retained Business Purchase or the Standalone Drug Sale and take, or refrain from taking, any action reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Separation, the Retained Business Purchase or the Standalone Drug Sale in furtherance of the intentions described above in this Section 6.17.

ARTICLE IX 

   

GENERAL PROVISIONS  

  

 SECTION 9.1 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and the other agreements and documents contemplated to be delivered in connection herewith, including any rights arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, shall, in the event Closing occurs, survive the Effective Time, except for (i) those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part at or after the Effective Time (including Section 6.8) and (ii) this Article IX. 

  

 SECTION 9.2 _Company Disclosure Letter; Parent Disclosure Letter_. There may have been included in the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter and may be included elsewhere in this Agreement items which are not "material," and such inclusion shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or agreement by the Company or the Parent, as appropriate, that such items are "material" or to affect the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement.

Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be considered to be made for
purposes of all other Sections of the Company Disclosure Letter or of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, as appropriate, to the extent that the relevance of
any such disclosure to any other Section of the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter, as appropriate, is reasonably apparent from the
text of such disclosure. The inclusion of any items or information in the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be
construed as an admission that such item or information (or any non-disclosed
item or information of comparable or greater significance) is material or
otherwise required to be scheduled as an exception from any representation,
warranty or covenant. Matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required

 SECTION 9.4 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be valid, legal and enforceable under applicable Law. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein and there had been contained herein instead such valid, legal and enforceable provisions as would most nearly accomplish the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision. 

  

 SECTION 9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Coordination Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 9.6 _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party or by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of each of the other parties (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of such other party). Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 9.6 shall be void. 

  

 SECTION 9.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for Section 6.8, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 8.5 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with matters as to which the party making such representations and warranties has no knowledge or only incomplete knowledge. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Each party to each of the Transaction Agreements shall be responsible only for its own representations, warranties, covenants, actions or omissions under each of the Transaction Agreements.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.8, however, (i) Parent shall be responsible for the representations, warranties, covenants, actions and omissions under each of the Transaction Agreements of Acquisition Sub, and (ii) the Company shall be responsible for the representations, warranties, covenants, actions and omissions, in each case prior to the Effective Time, under each of the Transaction Agreements of New Diamond and New Diamond Merger Sub. 

  

 SECTION 9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof). 

  

 SECTION 9.10 _Specific Performance; Jurisdiction_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and, with respect to claims in which the exclusive subject matter jurisdiction of such claims is federal, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) in the event any dispute arises out of this 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from such court, (iii) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, with respect to claims in
which the exclusive subject matter jurisdiction of such claims is federal,
the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and (iv) to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, consents to service being made through
the notice procedures set forth in Section 9.3. Each party hereto hereby
agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, service of any process,

EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11. 

  

 SECTION 9.12 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
