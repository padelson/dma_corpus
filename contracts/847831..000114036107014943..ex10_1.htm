**AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 

 

This  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 30, 2007 (this  "
_Agreement_ "), is among MAST ACQUISITION LTD., a Bermuda exempted limited 
company organized under the laws of Bermuda (" _Parent_ "), MAST MERGER SUB 
CORP., a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Liberia and 
a  wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and MC SHIPPING
INC., a  corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Liberia
(the  " _Company_ "). Certain terms used in this Agreement without 
definition shall have their meanings as defined in  _Section 7.11_.

 

 

WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company each  deems it advisable that Parent acquire the Company on the terms
and subject  to  the conditions provided for in this Agreement;

 

 

WHEREAS,  in furtherance thereof it is proposed that such acquisition be
accomplished  by  the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with
the Company as the  surviving corporation, in accordance with the Business
Corporation Act of the  Republic of Liberia (the " _BCAL_ "), pursuant to
which all of the shares of  voting common stock, $0.01 par value, of the
Company (" _Company Common  Stock_ ") issued and outstanding (each, a "
_Share_ " and, collectively,  the " _Shares_ "), other than certain Shares as
provided in  _Section 1.7(b)_ and Dissenting Shares, will be converted into
the  right to receive the Merger Consideration on the terms and subject to
the  conditions provided for in this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ");

 

 

WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of Parent (on its own behalf and
as the  sole  shareholder of Merger Sub), Merger Sub and the Company have
each approved this  Agreement and the Merger; and

 

 

WHEREAS,  the Company has been advised by Navalmar Transportes Maritimos 
LDA and Weco-Rederi  Holding A/S (the " _Principal Shareholders_ "), whose
representatives  on the Company Board resigned their positions as directors
of the Company prior  to the meeting of the Company Board held to approve
this Agreement, that,  concurrent with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, they and their  respective Affiliates are entering into binding
commitments to sell the  4,226,448 Shares and 849,270 Shares owned by them,
respectively, representing  in  the aggregate approximately 53% of the
outstanding Shares, to Parent at a cash  purchase price equal to $14.25 per
Share;

 

 

NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and  agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound  hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as
follows:

 

 

ARTICLE  I

 

 

_The  Merger_

 

 

SECTION  1.1 _The  Merger_ _._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set  forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the BCAL, at the
Effective  Time  Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and
the separate corporate  existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and
the Company shall be the  surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving  Corporation_ "). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

SECTION  1.2 _Closing_ _._ The  closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (New  York time) on a date to be specified by
the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "),  which date shall be no later than the
fifth (5th) business day after  satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article V_  (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the  Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions at such  time), at the offices of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and
McCloy LLP, 1 Chase  Manhattan Plaza, New York, New York 10005, unless
another time, date or place  is  agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

 

 

SECTION  1.3 _Effective  Time_ _._ Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as soon  as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall
file with the Minister  of  Foreign Affairs (as defined in the BCAL, the "
_Minister of Foreign  Affairs_ ") articles of merger pursuant to Section
10.2.5 of the BCAL executed  in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the BCAL (the " _Articles of  Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective
upon the filing of  the Articles of Merger or at such later time as is agreed
to by the parties  hereto and specified in the Articles of Merger (the time
at which the Merger  becomes effective is herein referred to as the "
_Effective  Time_ ").

 

 

SECTION  1.4 _Effects of the  Merger_ _._ The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in the  BCAL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject  thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers  and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest
in the Surviving  Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger  Sub  shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

SECTION  1.5 _Articles of  Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_ _._ At the  Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving  Corporation shall be amended in their entirety to
read as the articles of  incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub until
thereafter amended as provided  therein or by applicable Law (and subject to
_Section 4.9_ );  _provided_ , _however_ , that Article I of the articles of
incorporation  of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to provide that
the Surviving  Corporation shall be named "MC Shipping Inc."

 

 

SECTION  1.6 _Directors and  Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

 

 

(a) The  directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the  directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective  Time,  until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified  or  their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the articles  of  incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

 

(b) The  officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the  officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are  duly  appointed and qualified or their earlier death,
resignation or removal in  accordance with the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 


 

SECTION  1.7 _Conversion of  Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and  without any action on the part of the holders of any
securities of Merger Sub  or  the Company:

 

 

(a) Each  issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall
be converted  into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share  of  common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

(b) Any  shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock  and any Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Subsidiary of Parent  shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to
exist and no consideration  shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(c) Each  Share (other than (i) Shares to be canceled in accordance with 
_Section 1.7(b)_ and (ii) any Dissenting Shares) shall be  converted into the
right to receive $14.25 in cash, without interest (the  " _Merger
Consideration_ "). All such Shares, when so converted,  shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall  cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to  the  Effective
Time represented any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with  respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor  upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with this Agreement,  without
interest.

 

 

SECTION  1.8 _Exchange of  Certificates_.

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank  or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
for the  holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") to  receive, on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the
benefit of  holders of Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
holders of Shares  shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 1.7(c)_.
Parent  shall deposit such aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying
Agent at  or  prior to the Effective Time. Such aggregate Merger
Consideration  deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending its
disbursement to such holders,  be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) direct
obligations of the United  States of America, (ii) obligations for which the
full faith and credit of  the United States of America is pledged to provide
for the payment of principal  and interest, (iii) commercial paper rated the
highest quality by either  Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor\'s Ratings Services or  (iv) non-U.S. money market funds investing
solely in a combination of  the foregoing. Any interest and other income
resulting from such  investments shall be the property of, and shall be paid
to,  Parent. Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the 
Paying Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to this  paragraph.

 

 

(b) _Exchange  Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no
event  more than three (3) business days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation shall  cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or  certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry form),
which immediately  prior  to the Effective Time represented outstanding
Shares (the  " _Certificates_ "), whose shares were converted pursuant to 
_Section 1.7(c)_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,  (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be  effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon 
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such 
form and shall have such other customary provisions (including customary 
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent\'s message" with respect to 
shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may reasonably specify) and  (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in 
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a 
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter 
of  transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the 
instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required  by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to  receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (less any
applicable  excise and withholding Taxes in accordance with _Section
1.8(g)_),  without interest, for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate,  and  the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. If  payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the  Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be  a  condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so
surrendered shall be  properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and  (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and  other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to  a  Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate surrendered or  shall  have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation  that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until  surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
1.8_, each Certificate  shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the  right  to receive the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this  _Article I_, without interest.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) _Transfer  Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The
Merger  Consideration paid in respect of Shares upon the surrender for
exchange of  Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_
shall be  deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the  Shares previously represented by such Certificates, and at
the close of business  on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the
stock transfer books of  the  Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration  of  transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares  that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From  and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates that evidenced  ownership of Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall  cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares, except as otherwise  provided for herein or by applicable Law.
Subject to the last  sentence of _Section 1.8(e)_, if, at any time after the
Effective  Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason,  they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this 
_Article I_.

 

 

(d) _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have  been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact  by  the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if  required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond,  in  such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim  that  may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will  pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable  Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented  by  such Certificate, as
contemplated by this _Article I_.

 

 

(e) _Termination  of Fund_. At any time following the six-month anniversary
of the  Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying  Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect  thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
which have not  been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter
such holders shall  be  entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned  property, escheat, Tax or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof  with  respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon  surrender of any Certificates held by
such holders, as determined pursuant  to  this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. Any amounts remaining  unclaimed by such holders at such
time at which such amounts would otherwise  escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall become, to  the  extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of  all  claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _No  Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the 
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying  Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration
delivered to a  public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat, Tax  or  similar Law.

 

 

(g) _Withholding  Taxes_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the  Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration  otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger
such amounts  as  may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such  payment under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent
amounts are so  withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority,
the withheld amounts  shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to  the  holder of the Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was  made.

 

 

SECTION  1.9 _Appraisal  Rights_ _._ Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the  contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the  Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder
who did not vote in favor  of  the Merger (or consent thereto in writing)
and who is entitled to demand and  properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in  all  respects with, the provisions of
Section 10.8 of the BCAL (each, a  " _Dissenting Shareholder_ "), shall not
be converted into or be exchangeable  for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (the " _Dissenting  Shares_ "), but instead such Dissenting
Shareholder shall be entitled to  payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the  provisions of Section 10.8 of the
BCAL (and at the Effective Time, such  Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be  canceled and shall cease to exist,
and such Dissenting Shareholder shall cease  to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair  value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the provisions of  Section 10.8 of the BCAL),
unless and until such Dissenting Shareholder  shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights  to appraisal under the BCAL.
If any Dissenting Shareholder shall have  failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such  Dissenting Shareholder\'s
Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been  converted into and
become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the  Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration for each such Share, in accordance  with  _Section
1.7(c)_, without any interest thereon. The Company  shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of  any Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments  served pursuant to the
BCAL and received by the Company relating to  shareholders\' rights of
appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate  in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under  the BCAL. The
Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer  prior to the
Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or  instrument, or
waive any failure by a shareholder to timely comply with the  requirements of
the BCAL, unless Parent shall have given its written consent  to  such
payment or settlement offer or unless otherwise required by an order, 
decree, ruling or injunction of a court of competent  jurisdiction. Any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available  to the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section 1.8_ to pay for Shares for  which appraisal rights have
been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon  demand.

or in the  Company SEC Documents publicly filed prior to the date of this
Agreement,  excluding any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section
thereof, in  any  section relating to forward-looking statements and any
other disclosures  included therein that are cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in  nature (the " _Filed Company SEC Documents_ ") (it being
understood that  any matter set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter or in
such Filed Company  SEC Documents shall be deemed disclosed with respect to
any section of this  _Article II_ to which the matter relates, to the extent
the relevance  of such matter to such section is readily apparent):

 

 

SECTION  2.1 _Organization and  Standing_.

 

 

(a) The  Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws  of  the Republic of Liberia and has all requisite corporate power
and authority  necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets and
to carry on  its  business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly
licensed  or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in  which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location  of  the properties and assets owned or leased or held
under license by it makes  such  licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so  licensed, qualified or in good standing
would not, individually or in the  aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect  or  to impair in any material respect the
ability of the Company to perform its  obligations hereunder or prevent or
materially delay consummation of the  Merger. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Company Material  Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any change, event
or occurrence which has a  material adverse effect on the results of
operations, assets,  liabilities or financial condition of the Company and
its Subsidiaries  taken as a whole, other than changes, events, occurrences
or effects arising  out  of, resulting from or attributable to (i) changes
in conditions in any  geographic region in which the Company does business or
in the global economy  or  in capital or financial markets generally,
including changes in interest or  exchange rates, _provided_ that such
changes do not affect the Company and  its Subsidiaries in a disproportionate
manner, (ii) changes in general  legal, regulatory, political, economic or
business conditions or changes in  generally accepted accounting principles
that, in each case, generally affect  industries in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries conduct business,  _provided_ that such changes do not affect
the Company and its Subsidiaries  in a disproportionate manner, (iii) the
negotiation, execution,  announcement or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger,  including the impact thereof on relationships,
contractual or otherwise, with  customers, suppliers, distributors, partners,
collaborators or employees,  (iv) acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, or any
escalation or worsening of  any such acts of war, sabotage or terrorism
threatened or underway as of the  date of this Agreement, _provided_ that
such changes do not affect the  Company and its Subsidiaries in a
disproportionate manner, (v) storms,  earthquakes or other natural disasters,
_provided_ that such changes do not  affect the Company and its Subsidiaries
in a disproportionate manner,  (vi) any action required to be taken by the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or (vii) any
decline in the market  price, or change in trading volume, of the capital
stock of the Company or  any  failure of the Company to meet publicly
announced revenue or earnings  projections, _provided_ that the underlying
cause of any such decline,  change or failure may otherwise be taken into
consideration in determining  whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred.

(b) Each  of the Company\'s Subsidiaries is a corporation **** or  other
**** organization duly organized, validly existing and in  good standing
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its  organization. Each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries is duly licensed or  qualified to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which  the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of  the  properties and assets
owned or leased or held under license by it makes such  licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so  licensed,
qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the  aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse  Effect. The Filed
Company SEC Documents contain a true and complete  list of each such
Subsidiary and the jurisdiction of incorporation or  organization of such
Subsidiary. All the outstanding shares of  capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each such Subsidiary (except  for  directors\' qualifying
shares or the like) are duly authorized, have been validly  issued, are fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, and are  owned directly or
indirectly by the Company free and clear of all liens,  pledges, security
interests and transfer restrictions, except for such transfer  restrictions
of general applicability as may be provided under the Securities  Act of
1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated 
thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "), and other applicable securities Laws 
and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

 

(c) The  Company has previously made available to Parent complete and correct
copies  of  the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or other comparable
organizational  documents) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, in
each case as amended  through the date of this Agreement (the " _Company
Charter  Documents_ "). None of the Company or its Subsidiaries, 
respectively, is in material violation of the Company Charter  Documents.

 

 

SECTION  2.2 _Capitalization_.

were issued and outstanding (none of which were held  by  the Company in its
treasury) and (ii) 47,000 shares of Company Common Stock  were reserved for
issuance under the Company Stock Plan (none of which were  subject to
outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock  granted under
the Company Stock Plan). All shares of Company Common  Stock have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid,  nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. Since July 11, 2007, the  Company has not issued, or
reserved for issuance, any shares of its capital  stock or any securities

dilutive right with respect to, any shares of Company Common  Stock or any
capital stock of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries. There are no bonds,

of Company Common Stock or any such Subsidiary  may  vote.

any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of their respective 
properties or assets is bound, except, in the case of clause (ii), for  such
violations or defaults as would not, individually or in the aggregate,

obligations  hereunder or prevent or materially delay consummation of the 
Merger.

or  filings, declarations or registrations with, any Governmental Authority
are  necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company and  the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby, other  than such consents, approvals, filings, declarations or
registrations that,  if  not obtained, made or given, would not,
individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected (A) to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect,  (B) impair in any material respect the
ability of the Company to perform  its obligations hereunder, (C) prevent or
materially  delay consummation of the Merger or (D) impair in any material
respect  the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct their

SECTION  2.5 _Company SEC  Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed
Liabilities_.

 

 

(a) The  Company is a "foreign private issuer" (as that term is defined in

(together  with  the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "
_Exchange Act_ "))  and voluntarily files annual reports on Form 10-K and
quarterly reports on  Form  10-Q with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Company has  filed all required registration statements,
prospectuses, forms, reports and  proxy statements with the SEC, together
with all certifications required  pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "),  from and after January 1, 2004

and documents incorporated by reference  therein, the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). None of the Company\'s  Subsidiaries is required to file
periodic reports with the U.S. Securities  and  Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") pursuant to the Exchange Act. As of  their respective effective
dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents that  are  registration
statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities  Act) and as
of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other  Company SEC
Documents), the Company SEC Documents complied in all material  respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and  Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Company SEC  Documents, and none
of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective dates  contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material  fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements 
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

prepared in  accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited interim
statements,  as  indicated in the notes thereto) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods  involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present  in  all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and  its  consolidated Subsidiaries as of
the dates thereof and the consolidated results  of their operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject, in  the  case of unaudited
interim statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments  which  were not
and would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected  to
be material). The books and records of the Company and each of its 
Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects 
in  accordance with applicable legal and accounting requirements, and the
Company  Financial Statements are consistent in all material respects with
such books  and  records.

 

 

(c) Neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities
which would be  required to be reflected or reserved against on a

Company SEC Documents  (including the notes thereto), (ii) incurred after the
Balance Sheet Date  in the ordinary course of business, (iii) as contemplated

and  15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances  regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of  financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with  GAAP. The Company (i) has designed and maintains "disclosure  controls
and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of  the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed  by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act  is 
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified  in the SEC\'s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated
to the  Company\'s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required  disclosure, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of  such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the
date hereof, to the  Company\'s auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board (A) any  "significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses"
in the design or operation  of internal controls over financial reporting
that are reasonably likely to  adversely affect in any material respect the
Company\'s ability to record,  process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud,  whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have  a  significant role in the
Company\'s internal controls over financial  reporting. For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "significant  deficiency" and "material weakness" shall
have the meanings assigned to them  by  the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board in Auditing Standard No. 2, as  in  effect on the date
hereof.

best estimates,  assumptions and judgments, at the time provided to Parent
and Merger Sub, as  to  the future financial performance of the Company and
the  Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in _Section 2.5(e) of the Company

reasonably be expected to  be  greater than $100,000 for any individual
Action or Proceeding and $400,000  for  all Actions or Proceedings in the
aggregate (in either case excluding legal  fees  and expenses), nor is there
any injunction, order, judgment, ruling or decree  imposed upon the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, by or before  any Governmental
Authority.

Subsidiaries have been for the  past five (5) years and are currently in
compliance with all laws, statutes,  ordinances, codes, rules, regulations,
decrees, treaties, orders and other  legal  requirements of Governmental
Authorities (collectively, " _Laws_ ")  applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except for such  non-compliance as would not reasonably be
expected to be adverse to the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries in any
material respect. The Company and  each of its Subsidiaries have held for the
past five (5) years and are currently  holding all licenses, franchises,
permits, certificates, approvals, clearances  and authorizations from
Governmental Authorities necessary for the lawful  conduct of their
respective businesses (collectively, "Permits"), and all such  Permits are
valid and in full force and effect, except where the failure to  hold  the
same or of the same to be valid and in full force and effect would not, 
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (A) have a 
Company Material Adverse Effect, (B) impair in any material respect the 
ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder, (C) prevent or 
materially delay consummation of the Merger, or (D) impair in any material 
respect the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct their

Common Stock, contain any  untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

the Company Shareholders Meeting which shall have become  false or misleading

behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion  or  incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement.

officers, employees or consultants of the Company or its Subsidiaries who 
transferred to the Company or its Subsidiaries under the UK Transfer of 
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (" _TUPE_ ") has

Agreement by  Parent and Merger Sub or the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the  transactions contemplated hereby, other than such other consents,
approvals,  filings, declarations or registrations that, if not obtained,
made or given,  would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to impair  in  any material respect the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to perform its  obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay
consummation of the  Merger.

 

 

SECTION  3.4 _Information  Supplied_. The information supplied by Parent for

use its  reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\'
respective directors,  officers, employees, legal counsel, investment banking
and financial advisors,  independent accountants and any other agents and
representatives (collectively,  " _Representatives_ ") to, cease any
negotiations that may be ongoing  immediately prior to the No-Shop Period

(5) days following the No-Shop Period Start Date,  the prompt return or
written acknowledgement of destruction of all confidential  information
previously furnished to such parties or their Representatives other  than an
Excluded Party. During the period from the No-Shop Period  Start Date until
the Effective Time, or such earlier date as this Agreement  may  be
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company and its Subsidiaries 
shall not, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its  and its Subsidiaries\' Representatives not to, (i) solicit, initiate
or  knowingly encourage (including by way of providing information or access

inquiries,  proposals, or offers or any other efforts or attempts that
constitute, or could  reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal, or (ii) except to  inform Persons of the existence of the
provisions contained in this  _Section 4.2_, participate in or otherwise
cooperate with or assist in  any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish
any non-public information  to,  any Person regarding any inquiries,

or (ii) above prior to the commencement of the  No-Shop Period Start Date (
_provided_ that the Company enters into an  Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with such Person prior to providing any  non-public information and
promptly provides to Parent any non-public  information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to  any  such Person which was
not previously provided to Parent) or (y) be  applicable to any Excluded
Party; and _provided_ , _further_ , that  (1) prior to the commencement of
the No-Shop Period Start Date, if  requested to do so by any Person, the
Company may waive the provisions of any  "standstill" agreement between the
Company and such Person to the extent  necessary to permit such Person to
submit a Takeover Proposal and (2) to  the extent reasonably required to
evaluate a Takeover Proposal that includes  the  issuance of securities by
the Person making such Takeover Proposal, the Company  may enter into a
customary confidentiality agreement in order to obtain  non-public
information with respect to such Person. For purposes of  this Agreement, the
term " _Excluded Party_ " means any Person from whom  the Company receives a
Takeover Proposal prior to the No-Shop Period Start  Date  who, as
determined in good faith by, and in the reasonable judgment of, the  Company
Board as of the No-Shop Period Start Date, satisfies the requirements  of 
sub-clauses (A) and (B) of clause (z) of _Section 4.2(b)_  (disregarding the
fact, for this purpose, that such Takeover Proposal may not  have been an
unsolicited Takeover Proposal); _provided_ that any Excluded  Party shall
cease to be an Excluded Party for all purposes under this Agreement  at such
time as the Takeover Proposal made by such Person fails, in the  reasonable
judgment of the Company Board, to satisfy the requirements of  sub-clauses
(A) and (B) of clause (z) of  _Section __4_ _.2(b)_.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 4.2(a)_, commencing on the No-Shop Period Start
Date and at  any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in
addition to  continuing discussions with any Excluded Party regarding such
Excluded Party\'s  Takeover Proposal, (x) the Company and its Representatives
may have  discussions with any Person that has made an unsolicited Takeover
Proposal  in  order to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of
such proposal,  (y) if requested to do so by any Person, the Company may
waive the  provisions of any "standstill" agreement between the Company and
such Person  to  the extent necessary to permit such Person to submit an
unsolicited Takeover  Proposal and (z) if the Company Board (A) receives an
unsolicited  Takeover Proposal that it determines in good faith (after
consultation with  outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
recognized reputation (which  shall include DnB)) constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to  a  Superior Proposal and (B) determines
in good faith (after consultation with  outside legal counsel) that the
taking of any of the following actions is  advisable in order for the Company
Board to comply with its fiduciary duties  to  the holders of Company Common
Stock under applicable Law, the Company may  (I) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to  the Person making such
Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ that the Company first  enters into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and  promptly provides
to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company  or  its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was 
not  previously provided to Parent), (II) participate in discussions and 
negotiations with such Person regarding such Takeover Proposal and (III) to 
the  extent reasonably required to evaluate a Takeover Proposal that includes
the  issuance of securities by the Person making such Takeover Proposal,
enter into  a  customary confidentiality agreement in order to obtain non-
public information  with respect to such Person. The Company shall promptly
(and in any  event within one (1) business day) advise Parent of any Takeover
Proposal,  any  inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be
expected to lead  to a  Takeover Proposal or any request for non-public
information relating to the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any Takeover Proposal that  is  made or submitted by any Person during
the period commencing on the No-Shop  Period Start Date (including from an
Excluded Party the Company remains in  discussions with regarding a Takeover
Proposal after the No-Shop Period Start  Date), and at any time after the No-
Shop Period Start Date and prior to  obtaining Company Shareholder Approval,
the identity of the Person making any  such Takeover Proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest or request and shall  provide Parent with a copy (if
in writing) or summary of the terms and  conditions (if not in writing) of
any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry,  indication of interest or request
(which shall include copies of any written  materials received from or on
behalf of such Person relating to such Takeover  Proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest or request). The Company  shall keep Parent fully
informed of the status of any Takeover Proposal,  inquiry, indication of
interest or request, including promptly advising Parent  of any change to the
terms of any Takeover Proposal, after the No-Shop Period  Start Date.

(c) Except  as expressly permitted by this _Section 4.2(c)_, (i) the
Company  Board shall not (A) withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the  Company Recommendation or (B) publicly approve or recommend to
the holders  of Company Common Stock a Takeover Proposal (any action
described in this  clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation  Change_ "), and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries  shall enter into any letter of intent, merger, acquisition or
similar agreement  with respect to any Takeover Proposal (each, a " _Company
Acquisition  Agreement_ "), other than an Acceptable Confidentiality 
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Company  Shareholder
Approval, (x) other than in connection with a Takeover  Proposal, the Company
Board may withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation  if  it determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel)  that  such
action is advisable in order for the Company Board to comply with its 
fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Common Stock under applicable
Law,  and (y) subject to _Section 4.2(d)_, if the Company Board  (A)
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel  and
a financial advisor of recognized reputation (which shall include DnB)) 
that  any Takeover Proposal submitted by an Excluded Party prior to the No-
Shop Period  Start Date or any unsolicited Takeover Proposal received on or
after the No-Shop  Period Start Date, in either case, constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and  (B) determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal  counsel) that the taking of any of the following actions is advisable
in order  for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
holders of  Company Common Stock under applicable Law, the Company Board may
(I) make a  Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (II) cause the
Company to  enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior  Proposal, but only if the Company shall have concurrently with
entering into  such Company Acquisition Agreement terminated this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section 6.1(c)(i)_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(d) If  the Company Board determines to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change  as provided in _Section 4.2(c)(y)(I)_ or to authorize
the Company to  enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement as provided in 
_Section 4.2(c)(y)(II)_, such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or 
Company Acquisition Agreement (as applicable) may only become effective
after  the end of the fifth (5th) business  day (the  " _Notice Period_ ")
following Parent\'s receipt of written notice from the  Company (an "
_Adverse Recommendation Notice_ ") advising Parent that the  Company Board
intends to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change  or to 
authorize the Company to enter into such Company Acquisition Agreement,
which  notice shall contain a copy of the Superior Proposal to which such
Company  Adverse Recommendation Change or Company Acquisition Agreement
relates;  _provided_ that the Company shall negotiate in good faith with
Parent, to  the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, during the Notice Period
to enable Parent  to make proposed changes to the terms of this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that any material amendment to the terms of such
Superior  Proposal after the initial Adverse Recommendation Notice shall
require a new  Adverse Recommendation Notice and restart the five (5)
business day period  referred to above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company Board  shall not be entitled, in response to a Superior Proposal, to
effect a Company  Adverse Recommendation Change or permit the Company to
enter into a Company  Acquisition Agreement if, within the Notice Period,
Parent shall have made  an  offer that the Company Board determines in its
good faith judgment (having  considered the advice of its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) is  at  least as favorable to the Company\'s
shareholders as such Superior Proposal  (it  being agreed in each case that
the Company Board shall convene a meeting to  consider any such offer by
Parent reasonably promptly following the receipt  thereof).

 

 

(e) For  purposes of this Agreement:

 

 

" _Acceptable  Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality agreement
that  contains provisions that are no less restrictive with respect to the
Company\'s  counterparty than those contained in the Confidentiality 
Agreement. Following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall 
provide Parent with a correct and complete copy of any Acceptable 
Confidentiality Agreement within one (1) business day following the
execution  thereof.

 

 

" _Takeover  Proposal_ " means a bona fide written proposal or offer from any
Person (other  than Parent and its Subsidiaries) after the date, and not in
breach, of this  Agreement relating to any (i) direct or indirect acquisition
of all or  substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) direct  or indirect acquisition of all or substantially
all of the outstanding Company  Common Stock, (iii) tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would  result in any Person beneficially owning all
or substantially all of the  outstanding Company Common Stock or (iv) merger,
consolidation, share exchange,  business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar  transaction involving the Company.

 

 

" _Superior  Proposal_ " means a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board
determines in  good faith, after consultation with its legal and financial
advisors, and  consideration of all terms and conditions of such offer or
proposal (including  the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of
consummation), to be more  favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock
than the Merger, after giving  effect to any modifications proposed to be
made to this Agreement or any other  offer by Parent after Parent\'s receipt
of an Adverse Recommendation  Notice.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(f) Nothing  in this _Section 4.2_ shall prohibit the Company Board from 
(i) taking and disclosing to the Company\'s shareholders a position 
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of  Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law,  if the Company
Board determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel,  that
failure to so disclose such position could constitute a violation of 
applicable Law, or (ii) filing a copy of this Agreement and any amendments 
hereto, together with a description of its terms, on a Form 8-K under the 
Exchange Act. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for  purposes of
this _Section 4.2_, a factually accurate public statement  by the Company
that describes the Company\'s receipt of a Takeover Proposal  and  the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto and contains a  "stop-look-
and-listen communication" shall not be deemed a Company Adverse 
Recommendation Change.

 

 

(g) In  the event that, in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
4.2_ and  _Section 6.1(c)(i)_ , the Company terminates this Agreementand
enters into a  definitive Company Acquisition Agreement relating to a
Superior Proposal (or  any  subsequent definitive Company Acquisition
Agreement relating to a Superior  Proposal entered into pursuant to
procedures contained in any Company  Acquisition Agreement similar to those
contained in this _Section 4.2_ )  that (x) provides for a purchase price
and/or merger consideration per Share  payable solely in cash of at least
$15.00 and (y) is not subject to any  financing condition or other conditions
to consummation of such Superior  Proposal which are less favorable in the
aggregate to the Company\'s shareholders  than the conditions to Parent\'s
obligation to effect the Merger contained in  this Agreement, Parent will,
and will cause its Affiliates to, for a period  of  ninety (90) days after
such termination, (I) in the event that such  Superior Proposal includes a
tender offer for the Shares, tender any Shares  owned by them into such
tender offer prior to the expiration of such tender  offer, or (II) in the
event that such Superior Proposal includes a merger or  similar transaction
that is subject to approval by the Company\'s shareholders,  vote (or cause
to be voted) any Shares owned by them in favor of such merger  or  similar
transaction (together with any related proposals) at any meeting of  the 
Company\'s shareholders held for such purpose and, at the request of the
Company,  deliver an irrevocable proxy to the Company with respect to any
such  vote.

 

 

SECTION  4.3 _Reasonable Best  Efforts_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall  cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall
cause their respective  Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best

take, or cause to be  taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all

Governmental  Authority relating to the Merger, including any proceeding
initiated by a  private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all
material  respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received  by such party from, or given by such party to, any
Governmental Authority and  of  any material communication received or given
in connection with any proceeding  by a private party, in each case regarding
the Merger. Subject to  applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, each of the parties  hereto shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable  each will consult the other on, all

Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears  in  any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or  any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger.

 

 

(c) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained  in  this _Section 4.3_, each of the parties hereto shall use

asserted  by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the 
Merger. Without limiting any other provision hereof, Parent and the  Company

Outside Date, including by defending through litigation on the merits any
claim  asserted in any court by any Person, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each
and  every impediment under any Foreign Antitrust Law that may be asserted by

assets, in each case, as may be required in order to avoid  the  entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining  order
or other order in any Action or Proceeding, which would otherwise have  the 
effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the  Merger.

the Company may extend the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting to  the 
extent (A) necessary in order to obtain a quorum of its shareholders or  (B)
the Company reasonably determines that such delay is required by  applicable
Law. The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to  proxy

to the  execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be

and other document filed by it pursuant to the  requirements of federal or
state securities Laws and rules and regulations  promulgated thereunder and
(ii) other information concerning the business  and properties of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably  request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be  obligated to provide such access
or information if the Company determines,  in  its reasonable judgment, that
doing so would violate applicable Law or a  Contract or obligation of
confidentiality owing to a third party or jeopardize  the protection of an
attorney-client privilege. Until the Effective  Time, the information
provided pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to  the  terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 21, 2007, between Parent  and the

of (i) any notice or  other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority  in  connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or  from  any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in  connection with the Merger,
if the subject matter of such communication or  the  failure of such party
to obtain such consent could reasonably be expected to  be  material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any  actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such  party\'s
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise 
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which, in the case of either

Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger,
and  (iii) the discovery of any event, fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence  or non-occurrence of which, would reasonably be expected to cause
the failure  of  the closing conditions set forth in Section 5.2(a) or
Section 5.3(a),  respectively, or any material failure of Parent or Merger
Sub or the Company,  as  the case may be, or of any Representative thereof,
to comply with or satisfy  any  covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it  hereunder; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this  Section 4.8 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available  hereunder to the party receiving
such notice.

SECTION  4.9 _Indemnification  and Insurance_.

 

 

(a) From  and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and  the  Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless
each individual  who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the
Effective Time was,  a  director, officer, employee or agent of the Company
or of a Subsidiary of the  Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and,
collectively, the  " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages,  judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including
amounts paid in settlement or  compromise) and expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) in  connection with any Action or Proceeding
(whether civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative), whenever
asserted, based on or arising out  of,  in whole or in part, acts or
omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee\'s  capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or such  Subsidiary or taken at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including  in connection with
serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary  as a  director,
officer, employee or agent of another Person (including any employee  benefit
plan)), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including  in 
connection with the Merger), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable  Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and such
Subsidiaries  to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and
exculpation from  liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time  as  provided in (x) the Company Charter Documents as
currently in effect and  (y) the indemnification agreements with any of the
Indemnitees provided to  Parent prior to the date hereof, which shall survive
the Merger and  continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective  terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after
the  Effective Time, shall cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws of
the  Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnitees  with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and  indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the  Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed  or  otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder  of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after
the Effective Time,  Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and the
Surviving Corporation to,  pay  any expenses (including fees and expenses of
legal counsel) of any Indemnitee  under this _Section 4.9_ (including in
connection with enforcing the  indemnity and other obligations provided for
in this _Section 4.9_) as  incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; _provided_   that the individual to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to  repay such advances to the extent
required by applicable Law.

 

 

(b) Any  Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section
4.9_,  upon learning of any such Action or Proceeding, shall notify Parent,
the Company  and the Surviving Corporation, but the failure to so notify
Parent, the Company  and the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve such
party from any liability  which it may have under this paragraph except to
the extent such failure  materially prejudices Parent, the Company and/or the
Surviving  Corporation. Parent shall have the right, but not the 
obligation, to assume and control the defense of any litigation, claim or 
proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this  _Section
4.9_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") with counsel selected by the  Parent, which
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Indemnitee shall be permitted to  participate in the defense
of such Claim at its own expense; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that such
Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in  any  such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of Parent if (i) so  requested by Parent to
participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of  counsel to Indemnitee, a
conflict or potential conflict exists between Parent  and Indemnitee that
would make such separate representation advisable; and  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent shall not be required to pay for  more than one such
counsel for all Indemnitees in connection with any such  claim. Each of
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the  Indemnitees shall
cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access  to properties
and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause  to be 
furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, 
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably 
requested in connection therewith.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) For  the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time
(and for  so  long thereafter as any Claims thereunder are being
adjudicated), Parent shall  maintain in effect the Company\'s current
directors\' and officers\' liability  insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective  Time  with respect to those
individuals who are currently (and any additional  individuals who prior to
the Effective Time become) covered by the Company\'s  directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to  such
coverage, and in amount, not less favorable in any material respect in  the 
aggregate to such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the
date  hereof (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by
reputable  insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters
occurring at  or  prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, if the  aggregate annual premiums for such insurance shall exceed 300%
of the current  aggregate annual premium, then Parent shall provide or cause
to be provided  a  policy for the applicable individuals with the best
coverage as shall then  be  available at an annual premium of 300% of the
current aggregate annual premium  (but in no event shall such coverage be
less than the directors\' and officers\'  liability insurance coverage then
provided by Parent to its directors and  officers); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company may elect to  purchase prior to the Effective
Time, and Parent may elect to cause the Company  to purchase at or after the
Effective Time, in lieu of the foregoing insurance,  a directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance  program to be in
effect until the end of such six-year period (and for so long  thereafter as
any Claims thereunder are being adjudicated) with respect to  acts  or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (such coverage to  be
on  terms and conditions no less favorable to the covered directors and
officers  than such coverage existing on the date hereof).

 

 

(d) The  provisions of this _Section 4.9_ are (i) intended to be for the 
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs 
and  his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution  for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such  individual may have by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of 
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 4.9_ shall  not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights  of
any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 4.9_ applies unless  (x) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or  (y) the
affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such  termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees  to  whom this
_Section 4.9_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of  this _Section
4.9_).

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(e) In  the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective  successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person  and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such  consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially  all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case,  proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent  and  the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth  in this _Section 4.9_.

 

 

SECTION  4.10 _Fees and  Expenses_. Except as _provided_ in Section 6.3, all
fees  and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions  contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
fees or expenses,  whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 

 

SECTION  4.11   _Delisting_. Parent shall cause the Company\'s securities to
be  de-listed from the AMEX and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon
as  practicable following the Effective Time.

 

 

SECTION  4.12 _Parent  Representation on the Company Board_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to Parent\'s compliance with its obligations under _Section
4.2(g)_, in  the event that this Agreement is terminated for any reason other
than by the  Company pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)(ii)_, Parent shall
thereafter (but  only (x) following the termination of Parent\'s obligations
under _Section  4.2(g)_ , to the extent applicable, and (y) until such time
as Parent and  its Affiliates own less than fifty percent (50%) of the shares
of Company Common  Stock then outstanding) be entitled to designate for
appointment or election  to  the Company Board, upon written notice to the
Company (any such notice being  referred to herein as the " _Parent Notice_
"), (i) prior to the earlier to  occur of (A) the annual meeting of
shareholders of the Company to be held in  2008 (the " _2008 Shareholders
Meeting_ ") and (B) June 30, 2008, a number of  directors equal to one-half
of the size of the Company Board from time to time,  and (ii) commencing with
the earlier to occur of (A) the 2008 Shareholders  Meeting and (B) June 30,
2008, such number of directors, rounded to the nearest  whole number, as is
equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total  number of directors
on the Company Board (after giving effect to the directors  designated by
Parent pursuant to this sentence) by the percentage that the  number of
shares of Company Common Stock so owned by Parent and its Affiliates  bears
to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then  outstanding. In
furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon request  of Parent, use its
reasonable best efforts, subject to compliance with  applicable securities
Laws and applicable rules of the AMEX, to promptly  following receipt of a
Parent Notice cause Parent\'s designees (and any  replacement designees in
the event that any designee shall no longer be on  the  Company Board) to be
so appointed or elected to the Company Board and, in  furtherance thereof, to
the extent necessary, use its reasonable best efforts  to  increase the size
of the Company Board or obtain the resignation of such number  of its
directors as is necessary to give effect to the foregoing  provision.
Parent\'s right to designate members of the Company Board  pursuant to
_Section 4.12(a)_ shall not be assignable to any transferee of  shares of
Company Common Stock from Parent or any of its  Affiliates. If at any time
there is a greater number of designees of  Parent serving on the Company
Board than the number of designees to which Parent  is then entitled pursuant
to this _Section 4.12(a)_ , Parent shall  immediately cause one or more of
its designees to resign from the Company Board  in order that there not be
more designees of Parent serving on the Company  Board  than the number to
which it is entitled.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) During  such period as designees of Parent constitute one-half of the
Company Board  pursuant to an appointment or election in accordance with
_Section  4.12(a)(i)_ , any vote by the Company Board to cause the Company to
take any  action, in order to be effective, must include the affirmative vote
of at least  one (1) director who has not been so designated by Parent.

 

 

(c) Following  the appointment or election to the Company Board of any
designees of Parent  pursuant to _Section 4.12(a)(ii)_ , and until such time
as Parent and its  Affiliates own all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock,  the Company Board shall have at least three (3)
directors who are directors  of  the Company on the date of this Agreement
(other than the designees of the  Principal Shareholders) and who are not
officers of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries (" _Independent
Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,  that if the number of Independent
Directors shall thereafter be reduced below  three (3) for any reason
whatsoever, then the remaining Independent Director  or  Directors shall be
entitled to identify a person or persons who is not then  an  officer or
Affiliate of the Company, Parent or any of their respective  Affiliates and
who otherwise qualifies as "independent" under the applicable  rules or
listing standards of any securities exchange or market on which the  shares
of Company Common Stock are then listed or approved for trading (any  such 
person being referred to herein as a " _Qualified Person_ "; it being 
understood that, for purposes of this definition, a person who would
otherwise  not be considered an Affiliate of the Company shall not be deemed
an Affiliate  of the Company solely because he or she is a director of the
Company), willing  to serve as an Independent Director, in which case such
remaining Independent  Director or Directors shall be entitled to designate
any such Qualified Person  or Persons to fill such vacancy or vacancies, and
any such designated Qualified  Person or Persons shall be deemed to be an
Independent Director for purposes  of  this Agreement; and _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , that if no  Independent Directors then remain, the
other directors shall be required to  designate three (3) Qualified Persons
to fill such vacancies, and such persons  shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this  Agreement.

 

 

(d) Following  the election or appointment of any designees of Parent
pursuant to _Section  4.12(a)(ii)_ and for so long thereafter as the Company
Board is required to  include Independent Directors in accordance with
_Section 4.12(c)_ , the  approval by affirmative vote or written consent of
either a majority of the  Independent Directors then in office or the holders
of a majority of the  outstanding Shares not held by the Parent or its
Affiliates (" _Independent  Approval_ ") shall be required to authorize (and
such authorization shall  constitute the authorization of the Company Board,
as applicable, and no other  action on the part of the Company, including any
action by any other committee  thereof or any other director of the Company,
shall, unless otherwise required  by __ applicable Law, be required or
permitted to authorize)  (w) any Related Party Transaction (as defined
below), (x) the  deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under
the Exchange Act  or  the delisting of the shares of Company Common Stock
from the AMEX, (y) any  amendment or modification of, or any waiver of any
right of the Company under,  this _Section 4.12_ or (z) any amendment of the
Company Charter  Documents adverse to the interests of the shareholders of
the Company (other  than Parent and its Affiliates). The Independent
Directors shall have  the authority to retain such counsel and other advisors
at the expense of the  Company as are reasonably appropriate to the exercise
of their duties in  connection with this _Section 4.12_. In addition, the 
Independent Directors shall have the authority to institute any action, on 
behalf of the Company, to enforce performance of this _Section  4.12_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(e) During  any period commencing on the furnishing of a Parent Notice and
ending on the  date on which Parent\'s designees are elected to the Company
Board in accordance  with such Parent Notice, the covenants of the Company
set forth in _Section  4.1_ shall be in full force and effect regardless of
any termination of this  Agreement.

 

 

(f) During  any period in which Parent is entitled to the election or
appointment of any  designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section
4.12(a)_ , neither  Parent nor any of its Affiliates will acquire any
additional shares of Company  Common Stock from any shareholder of the
Company at a price less than the Merger  Consideration (as adjusted for stock
dividends, stock splits and other similar  changes in the Company Common
Stock), except pursuant to an offer made to all  shareholders of the Company
to purchase all of their shares at the same price  or  with prior
Independent Approval.

 

 

(g) Parent  shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, vote all shares of
Company Common  Stock at any time owned by them so as to give effect to the
provisions of this  _Section 4.12_.

 

 

(h) All  holders of Company Common Stock from time to time (other than Parent
and its  Affiliates) may rely on the provisions of this _Section 4.12_ which
relate  to the appointment and approval rights of the Independent Directors,
which  provisions are intended to be for the benefit of such holders of
Company Common  Stock and shall be enforceable by them.

 

 

(i) For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Related Party Transaction_ " shall 
mean:

 

 

(i) Any  sale of the assets or issuance of shares of capital stock of the
Company or  any  Subsidiary of the Company to (or any acquisition of assets
from or share  subscription in) Parent or any of its Affiliates, other than a
subscription  for  shares of Company Common Stock by Parent or any of its
Affiliates pursuant  to a  rights offering made available to all holders of
Company Common Stock on a  pro  rata basis and for the same amount and form
of consideration and otherwise  on  substantially the same terms and
conditions; or

 

 

(ii) Any  merger or consolidation between or among the Company or any
Subsidiary of the  Company, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its
Affiliates, on the other;  or

ancillary arrangements or rights  entailing no monetary payments and other
than reasonable third-party legal  fees,  out-of-pocket expense
reimbursement and indemnification for the benefit of  Parent or any of its
Affiliates for liabilities in respect of which other  holders of the same
class have no liability; or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(iv) Any  other transaction or series of related transactions between or
among the Company  and/or any Subsidiary of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent or any of  its  Affiliates, on the other, other than payments in
respect of customary director  fees in accordance with past practice or other
ordinary course transactions  the  value of any of which does not exceed
$100,000.

the opportunity to  participate in the defense and settlement of any
litigation against the Company  and/or its directors relating to the

prior to the Effective Time, shall not be  unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

(with the appropriate owner  certifications attached thereto) claiming the
exemption provided by Section  883  of the Code.

Time:

 

 

(a) The  Company shall take the actions set forth in _Section 4.16(a) of
the  Company Disclosure Letter_; and

or (y) where the  failure of any such representation or warranty to be true
and correct (without  giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
"Company Material Adverse  Effect" set forth therein) would not, individually
or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; and Parent  shall have received a certificate of an executive
officer of the Company to  that  effect.

 

 

(b) The  Company shall have performed or complied with in all material
respects all  agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied  with by it on or prior to the Effective Time; and
Parent shall have received  a  certificate of an executive officer of the
Company to that effect.

 

 

SECTION  5.3 _Conditions  to the Obligations of the Company_. The
obligations of the Company  to effect the Merger shall be subject to the
satisfaction (or waiver, if  permissible under applicable Law) on or prior to
the Closing Date of the  following conditions:

 

 

(a) Each  of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set
forth in  this  Agreement shall be true and correct at and as of the
Effective Time as if made  on such date, except where the failure of any such
representation or warranty  to  be true and correct would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably  be  expected to impair the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to perform its  obligations hereunder or prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Merger;  and the Company shall have
received a certificate of an executive officer of  Parent to that effect.

 

 

(b) Parent  and Merger Sub shall each have performed or complied with in all
material  respects all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to
be performed  or complied with by it on or prior to the Effective Time; and
the Company shall  have received a certificate of an executive officer of
Parent to that  effect.

 

 

SECTION  5.4 _Frustration  of Closing Conditions_ _._ Neither the Company
nor Parent or  Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth
in  Section 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such 
failure was caused by such party\'s failure to use reasonable best efforts
to  consummate the Merger, to the extent required by and subject to Section
4.5  and the other applicable provisions of Article IV.

_Termination_

 

 

SECTION  6.1 _Termination_. This  Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
abandoned at any time prior to the  Effective Time, whether before or after
receipt of the Company Shareholder  Approval, except as set forth below:

 

 

(a) by  the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized
by the  Company Board and the Board of Directors of Parent; or

 

 

(b) by  either the Company or Parent:

 

 

(i) if  any Restraint enjoining, restraining, preventing or prohibiting
consummation  of  the Merger or making the consummation of the Merger
illegal shall be in effect  and shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided_ that the right  to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
6.l(b)(i)_ shall not  be available to a party if the issuance of such final,
non-appealable Restraint  was primarily due to the failure of such party to
perform any of its obligations  under this Agreement;

 

 

(ii) if  the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the Outside
Date;  _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this 
_Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure  to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement resulted in the failure 
of the Merger to be so consummated by the Outside Date; or

 

 

(iii) if  the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a
duly convened  Company Shareholders Meeting (or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof)  by  reason of the failure to obtain the required vote
upon a vote taken thereon;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
not be permitted to  terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
6.1(b)(iii)_ if the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives has  failed to comply in any material respect with its
obligations under _Section  4.2_ , _4.4_ or _4.5_ ; or

 

 

(c) by  the Company:

 

 

(i) if,  at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, the  Company has complied with the terms of this Agreement,
including  _Section 4.2(c)_, and concurrently it enters into a definitive
Company  Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal; _provided_
,  _however_ , that such termination shall not be effective unless
concurrently  therewith the Company fulfills its obligations under _Section
6.3_;  or

 

 

(ii) if  (A) the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in  this Agreement shall not be true and correct on and as of the date
of such  determination as if made on such date (other than those
representations and  warranties that address matters only as of a particular
date which shall be  true  and correct as of such date), but only to the
extent that such failure would  cause the condition contained in _Section
5.3(a)_ not to be satisfied as of  such date; or (B) Parent or Merger Sub
shall have breached or failed to  perform or comply with any obligation,
agreement or covenant required by this  Agreement to be performed or complied
with by them, but only to the extent  that  such failure would cause the
condition contained in _Section 5.3(b)_ not to  be satisfied as of such date
and such condition is, as a result of such breach  or failure (in each case
under clauses (A) and (B)), incapable of being  satisfied by the Outside
Date; or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(d) by  Parent, if (i) the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth  in this Agreement shall not be true and correct on and as of the date
of such  determination as if made on such date (other than those
representations and  warranties that address matters only as of a particular
date, which shall be  true and correct as of such date), but only to the
extent that such failure  would cause the condition contained in _Section
5.2(a)_ not to be satisfied  as of such date; or (ii) the Company shall have
breached or failed to  perform or comply with any obligation, agreement or
covenant required by this  Agreement to be performed or complied with by it,
but only the extent that  such  breach or failure would cause the condition
contained in  _Section 5.2(b)_ not to be satisfied as of such date and such 
condition is, as a result of any such breach or failure (in each case under 
clauses (i) and (ii)), incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date; or 
(iii) a Triggering Event shall have occurred.

 

 

SECTION  6.2 _Effect  of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement  as provided in Section 6.1, written notice thereof shall be
given to the  other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof
pursuant to which such  termination is made, and this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void  (other than Sections 4.2(g), 4.10, 4.12, 6.2
and 6.3, Article VII, the  last sentence of Section 4.7 and the
Confidentiality Agreement, each of  which shall survive termination of this
Agreement at any time in accordance  with  their respective terms), and
there shall be no liability as a result thereof  on  the part of Parent or
the Company or their respective directors, officers and  Affiliates, except
(i) the Company may have liability as provided in  Section 6.3, and (ii)
nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall  relieve any party from liability
for fraud or any willful breach of this  Agreement occurring prior to
termination of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  6.3 _Termination  Fee_. In the event that:

 

 

(a) (i) after  the date of this Agreement a Takeover Proposal has been
publicly announced  (whether or not conditional or withdrawn) or made known
to the Company, (ii)  after the date of such announcement or knowledge by the
Company, this Agreement  is terminated by (A) either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section  6.1(b)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ or (B) Parent pursuant to
_Section  6.1(d)(i)_ or (ii) as a result of a breach or failure by or on the
part of  the Company and (iii) within twelve (12) months after such
termination the  Company shall have consummated any Takeover Proposal, or a
definitive agreement  contemplating a Takeover Proposal is executed, or the
Company recommends or  submits to shareholders of the Company for adoption or
acceptance a Takeover  Proposal or a definitive agreement contemplating a
Takeover Proposal (the  Takeover Proposal so consummated, executed,
recommended or submitted need not  be  the same Takeover Proposal that was
publicly disclosed, announced or made known  to the Company); or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) this  Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
6.1(c)(i)_  or by Parent pursuant _to Section 6.1(d)(iii)_ ;

 

 

then  the  Company shall (A) in the case of a termination described in
paragraph  (a) __ of this _Section 6.3_, upon the earlier of the 
consummation of the transaction contemplated by such Takeover Proposal, the 
execution of a definitive agreement contemplating a Takeover Proposal or the 
recommendation by the Company or the submission to its shareholders for
adoption  or acceptance a Takeover Proposal or a definitive agreement
contemplating a  Takeover Proposal or (B) in the case of a termination
described in  paragraph (b) of this _Section 6.3_, on the date of such
termination,  pay Parent a fee equal to $7,750,000 **** (the " _Termination 
Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account 
designated by Parent.

 

 

SECTION  6.4 _Acknowledgment_. The  Company acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in  Section 6.3 are an integral part of the Merger and
that, without these  agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
If the  Company fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee and, in order to
obtain such  payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company  for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent
its reasonable costs  and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses) incurred in  connection with such suit.

 

 

ARTICLE  VII

 

 

_Miscellaneous_

 

 

SECTION  7.1 _Survival  of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_.
The  representations and warranties contained herein or in any other
writing  delivered pursuant hereto, as well as any covenant or agreement of
the parties  that by its terms contemplates performance exclusively prior to
the Effective  Time, shall survive until (but not beyond) the Effective 
Time. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit any covenant or agreement  of the
parties that by its terms contemplates performance in whole or in part  after
the Effective Time.

 

 

SECTION  7.2 _Amendment  or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this  Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before  or after approval of the Merger by the holders of Company
Common Stock, by  written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by
their respective  Boards of Directors; provided, however, that following the
Company Shareholder  Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the
provisions hereof which  by Law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange would  require further approval by the holders of
Company Common Stock without such  approval.

 

 

SECTION  7.3 _Extension  of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time,  any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the  representations and warranties of any other party
hereto, (b) extend the  time for the performance of any of the obligations or
acts of any other party  hereto or (c) waive compliance by any other party
with any of the  agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided
herein, waive  any  of such party\'s conditions; provided that after the
Company Shareholder Approval  is obtained, there may not be any extension or
waiver of this Agreement or  any  portion thereof which, by Law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant  stock exchange, requires further
approval by such  shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by  the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder
shall  operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof  preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other  right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any  such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument  in  writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  7.4 _Assignment_. Neither  this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall  be assigned, in whole or in part,
by operation of Law or otherwise, by any  of  the parties without the prior
written consent of the other parties; provided  that Parent and Merger Sub
may assign its rights, interests and obligations  under this Agreement to any
of its Affiliates. Subject to the  preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit  of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors  and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment not permitted under  this section shall be null and void.

 

 

SECTION  7.5 _Counterparts_. This  Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to  be  an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same  agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been  signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties.

 

 

SECTION  7.6 _Entire  Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, together  with the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement,  (a) constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior  agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or  any  of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and  (b) except for the provisions of _Section 4.9_
and _Section  4.12_ to the extent provided therein, is not intended to and
shall not confer  upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies  hereunder.

 

 

SECTION  7.7 _Governing  Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_.

 

 

(a) This  Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws  of  the State of New York applicable to Contracts executed in and
to be performed  entirely within that State.

 

 

(b) The  parties hereto hereby agree to bring all Actions or Proceedings
arising out  of  or relating to this Agreement in the federal or state
courts located in the  Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York, New York
and the parties  irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the  defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any such Action or  Proceeding. The parties hereto agree that a final
judgment in any  such Action or Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other  jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by  applicable Law.

 

 

(c) Each  of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights
to trial  by  jury in any Action or Proceeding arising out of or related to
this  Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 


 

SECTION  7.8 _Specific  Enforcement_.

 

 

(a) The  parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of  the  provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their  specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed  that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent  breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions  of this Agreement in the federal or state courts located in the
Borough of  Manhattan of the City of New York, New York without bond or other
security  being  required, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled  at Law or in equity.

 

 

(b) In  circumstances under which the Termination Fee is payable and has been
paid,  Parent and Merger Sub agree that (i) to the extent they have incurred
losses  or  damages in connection with this Agreement, their sole and
exclusive remedy  against the Company and any of its directors, officers or
Affiliates for any  breach, loss or damage shall be to receive payment of the
Termination Fee to  the  extent provided in _Section 6.3_ and (ii) upon
payment in full of such  amounts, (x) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
have any other rights or claims  or seek damages against the Company or any
of its directors, officers or  Affiliates under this Agreement or otherwise,
whether at law or equity, in  contract, in tort or otherwise, and (y) neither
the Company nor any of its  directors, officers or Affiliates shall have any
further liability or  obligations relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby. Nothing herein shall
relieve Parent or Merger  Sub of liability to pay the Merger Consideration in
the event the Merger  occurs. Parent and Merger Sub agree and acknowledge
that none of the  directors, officers or Affiliates of the Company shall have
any personal  liability hereunder, including, without limitation, for any
breach of this  Agreement or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty.

 

 

SECTION  7.9 _Notices_. All  notices, requests and other communications to
