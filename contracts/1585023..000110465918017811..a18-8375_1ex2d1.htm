_Agreement_ "), by and among HarborOne Bancorp, Inc., a Massachusetts
corporation (" _Buyer_ "), Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC, a Maryland limited
liability company of which Buyer is the sole member (" _Merger LLC_ "), and
Coastway Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the respective Boards of Directors of Buyer and the Company and
the managing member of Merger LLC have determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective corporations and shareholders or sole member to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the strategic business combination
provided for herein;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as a condition to the willingness of Buyer and Merger LLC to
enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and executive officers of the
Company (the " _Voting Agreement Stockholders_ ") has entered into a Voting
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, with Buyer (each a " _Voting
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which each Voting Agreement Stockholder has agreed,
among other things, to vote such Voting Agreement Stockholders shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
the Voting Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Buyer, Merger LLC, and the Company intend to effect a merger
(the " _Merger_ ") of Merger LLC with and into the Company in accordance with
this Agreement and the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ ") and
the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act, as amended (the " _MLLCA_ "), with
the Company to be the surviving entity in the Merger. The Merger will be
followed immediately by a merger of the Company with and into Buyer (the "
_Upstream Merger_ "), with the Buyer to be the surviving entity in the
Upstream Merger. It is intended that the Merger be mutually interdependent
with and a condition precedent to the Upstream Merger and that the Upstream
Merger shall, through the binding commitment evidenced by this Agreement, be
effected immediately following the Effective Time (as defined below) without
further approval, authorization or direction from or by any of the parties
hereto; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I - THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in

1.2 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable after
all of the conditions set forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied or,
if permissible, waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same, the

effective on the date of such filings or at the time and date specified
therein (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided herein and as provided in the applicable provisions of
the MGCL and the MLLCA.

 



 

1.4 _Upstream Merger_. Immediately following the Merger, in accordance with
the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (" _MBCA_ ") and the MGCL, the
Company will merge with and into Buyer in the Upstream Merger, the separate
existence of the Company will cease and Buyer shall continue its corporate
existence under its Articles of Organization, Bylaws and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Buyer, as the surviving corporation in the
Upstream Merger, being sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

 



 

1.5 _Closing_. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
consummated at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") that will take place by mail or
electronic delivery, or, at the option of Buyer, at the offices of Goodwin
Procter LLP, 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02210, on a date to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than three Business Days (as
defined in Section 9.2) after all of the conditions to the Closing set forth
in Article VII (other than conditions to be satisfied at the Closing, which
shall be satisfied or waived at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived in
accordance with the terms hereof, such day being referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_." Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may take place at
such other place, time or date as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by
Buyer, the Company and Merger LLC.

 



 

1.6 _Charter and Bylaws_.

 



 

(a) The Charter of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Charter of the Interim Surviving Corporation as

effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the
Interim Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided therein

(b) The Articles of Organization of Buyer, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Organization of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance
with applicable law. The Bylaws of Buyer, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until

1.7 _Directors of the Interim Surviving Corporation and the Surviving
Corporation_. The directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors of

the Charter and Bylaws of the Interim Surviving Corporation. The directors of
Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the

Subject to the foregoing and, as determined by Buyer in Buyers sole
discretion, following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer will

deliver an agreement and plan of merger in respect of the Bank Merger.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II - MERGER CONSIDERATION; 
EXCHANGE PROCEDURES**

 



 

2.1 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Buyer, the Company and Merger LLC or any stockholder of
the Company:

 



 

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Buyer (" _Buyer
Common Stock_ ") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding following the Effective
Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

 



 

(b) Each membership interest of Merger LLC immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time without any
conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Buyer Company Stock) shall become and
be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in
this Agreement, the right to receive $28.25 in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

2.2 _Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers_. All shares of Company Common
Stock, when converted as provided in Section 2.1(c), shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate or direct registration statement (a "
_Certificate_ ") previously evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive, for each such share of Company Common Stock, the
Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock
shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company,
other than the right to receive the Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration as provided under this Article II. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of
shares of Company Common Stock, other than transfers of Company Common Stock
that have occurred prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

2.3 _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(a) On or before the Closing Date, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, Buyer shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to a bank
or trust company designated by Buyer and reasonably satisfactory to the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable under _Section 2.1(c)_ (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event
the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make all such payments, Buyer shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange
Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of funds
required to make such payments.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time but in no event
later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, and _provided_
that the Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange
Agent all information which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its
obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate or Certificates, a form of letter of transmittal in
a form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and the Company (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall
have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ of this Agreement. Upon
proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a check representing that amount of cash to which such
former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to
this Agreement in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to this
Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration provided in
_Section 2.1_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash constituting
Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) The Exchange Agent or Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to
deliver cash to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the
Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock
for exchange as provided in this Section 2.3, or an appropriate affidavit of
loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be required in
each case by Buyer or the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for twelve months after the Effective Time (as
well as any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be
delivered by the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any stockholders of the Company who
have not theretofore complied with _Section 2.3(b)_ shall

 



      
 

 



 

thereafter look only to Buyer for the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest
thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock are
not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed on or before the day
prior to the date on which such cash would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the
extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become
the property of Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession shall be
delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer
books of the Company to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books
shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with
respect to ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock represented by any
Certificate, Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any
Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third
party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

 



 

(e) Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as
Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. Any amounts so
deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer.

 



 

2.4 _Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (collectively, the " _Company
Stock Options_ ") granted under the Coastway Bancorp, Inc. 2015 Equity
Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _Company Equity Plan_ "), whether vested or
unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
which has not been exercised or canceled prior thereto shall, at the Effective
Time, be canceled and, as of the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to the
holder thereof cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock provided for in such Company Stock Option and
(ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock provided for in such Company Stock Option,
which cash payment shall be made without interest and shall be net of all
applicable withholding taxes. At the Effective Time, the Company Equity Plan
shall terminate and shall be of no further force and effect and shall be
deemed to be deleted. The Company shall take all actions necessary in order to
effect the provisions of this Section 2.4, including, without limitation,
seeking all necessary approvals and providing any notices required under the
Company Equity Plan.

 



 

(b) As of the Effective Time, all restricted stock awards granted under the
Company Equity Plan shall vest in full so as to no longer be subject to any
forfeiture or vesting requirements, and all such shares of Company Common

(c) Each Company Employee Program that is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) or 501(c)(9) of the Code is so qualified and has received a favorable
determination or approval letter from the IRS with respect to such
qualification, or may rely on an opinion letter issued by the IRS with respect
to a prototype plan adopted in accordance with the requirements for such
reliance, or has time remaining for application to the IRS for a determination
of the qualified status of such Company Employee Program for any period for
which such Company Employee Program would not otherwise be covered by an IRS
determination and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event or omission has
occurred that would cause any Company Employee Program to lose such
qualification.

 



 

(d) Each Company Employee Program is, and has been operated, in material
compliance with applicable laws and regulations and is and has been
administered in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and with its
terms, in each case, in all material respects. No litigation or governmental
administrative proceeding, audit or other proceeding (other than those
relating to routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Employee Program or any
fiduciary or service provider thereof. All payments and/or contributions
required to have been made with respect to all Company Employee Programs
either have been made or have been accrued in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

the terms of the applicable Company Employee Program and applicable law and
with respect to any such contributions, premiums, or other payments required
to be made under or with respect to any Company Employee Program that are not
yet due or payable, to the extent required by GAAP, adequate reserves are
reflected on the Company Balance Sheet. The Company Employee Programs satisfy
in all material respects the minimum coverage and discrimination requirements
under the Code.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
no Company Employee Program is a single employer pension plan (within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA (as defined below)) for which the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate could incur liability under Section 4063 or
4064 of ERISA or a plan maintained by more than one employer as described in
Section 413(c) of the Code and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA that has not been paid in full.

 



 

(f) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or contributes to,
or within the past six years has maintained or contributed to, any Employee
Program that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 412 of the Code,
Section 302 of ERISA or is a Multiemployer Plan (as defined below).

 



 

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
none of the Company Employee Programs provides health care or any other non-
pension welfare benefits to any employees after their employment is terminated
(other than as required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or similar
state law) and the Company has never promised to provide such post-termination
benefits.

 



 

(h) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
each Company Employee Program may be amended, terminated, or otherwise
modified by the Company to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law,
including the elimination of any and all future benefit accruals thereunder
and no employee communications or provision of any Company Employee Program
has failed to effectively reserve the right of the Company or the ERISA
Affiliate to so amend, terminate or otherwise modify such Company Employee
Program. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has announced its
intention to modify or terminate any Company Employee Program or adopt any
arrangement or program which, once established, would come within the
definition of a Company Employee Program. Each asset held under each Company
Employee Program may be liquidated or terminated without the imposition of any
redemption fee, surrender charge or comparable liability.

 



 

(i) The per share exercise price of each Option is no less than the fair
market value of a share of Company Common Stock on the date of grant of such
Option (and as of each later modification thereof within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code) determined in a manner consistent with Section 409A
of the Code. Each Company Employee Program that constitutes in any part a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code has been operated and maintained in all material respects in
operational and documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and
applicable guidance thereunder. No payment to be made under any Company
Employee Program is, or to the Knowledge of the Company, will be, subject to
the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) No Company Employee Program is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction
outside the United States.

 



 

(k) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(k)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company
Stockholder Approval, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby could (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) (i) result
in, or cause the accelerated vesting payment, funding or delivery of, or
increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee,
officer, director or other service provider of the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates; (ii) limit the right of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates
to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company
Employee Program or related trust; (iii) result in any "parachute payment" as
defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (whether or not such payment is
considered to be reasonable compensation for services rendered); or (iv)
result in a requirement to pay any tax "gross-up" or similar "make-whole"
payments to any employee, director or consultant of the Company or an ERISA
Affiliate. _Schedule 3.14(k)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the
Companys "disqualified individuals" for purposes of Section 280G of the Code.

Employee Program shall include a reference to such trust, organization or
other vehicle.

 



 

(ii) " _ERISA_ " means the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended.

 



 

(iii) An entity "maintains" an Employee Program if such entity sponsors,
contributes to, or provides benefits under or through such Employee Program,
or has any obligation to contribute to or provide benefits under or through
such Employee Program, or if such Employee Program provides benefits to or
otherwise covers any current or former employee, officer or director of such
entity (or their spouses, dependents, or beneficiaries).

 



 

(iv) An entity is an " _ERISA Affiliate_ " of the Company (or other entity if
the context of this Agreement requires) if it would have ever been considered
a single employer with the Company (or other entity if the context of this
Agreement requires) under Section 4001(b) of ERISA or part of the same
"controlled group" as the Company for purposes of Section 302(d)(3) of ERISA.

3.15 _Labor Matters_. There are no labor or collective bargaining agreements
to which the Company or its Subsidiary is a party. There is no union
organizing effort pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or its Subsidiary. There is no labor strike, labor dispute
(other than routine employee grievances that are not related to union
employees), work slowdown, stoppage or lockout pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company or its Subsidiary. There is no
unfair labor practice or labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or its Subsidiary
(other than routine employee grievances that are not related to union
employees). The Company and its Subsidiary is in material compliance with all
applicable laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours, and are not engaged in any
unfair labor practice. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary is a party to,
or bound by, any agreement for the leasing of employees. _Schedule 3.15_
contains a complete and accurate list of all employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary employees as of the date of this Agreement, setting forth for each
employee: his or her position or title; whether paid on a salary, hourly or
commission basis and the employees actual annual base salary or other rates
of compensation; and date of hire. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.15_ , in
the past 12 months, to the Knowledge of the Company, no officer with the title
of vice president or above of the Company or any Subsidiary has expressed any
plans to terminate his or her employment with the Company.

 



 

3.16 _Insurance_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is insured, and
during each of the past three calendar years has been insured, for reasonable
amounts with financially sound and reputable insurance companies against such
risks as companies engaged in a similar business would, in accordance with
good business practice customarily be insured, and has maintained all
insurance required by applicable laws and regulations. _Schedule 3.16_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule lists all insurance policies maintained by the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, including, without
limitation, any bank-owned life insurance policies (" _BOLI_ "). Except as set
forth on _Schedule 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the
policies and bonds maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are in
full force and effect and all claims thereunder have been filed in a due and
timely manner and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such claim has been
denied. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of or
default under any insurance policy, and there has not occurred any event that,
with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute such
a breach or default. The value of the BOLI set forth on _Schedule 3.16_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule is fairly and accurately reflected on the Company
Balance Sheet. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the BOLI, and any other life insurance policies on the
lives of any current and former officers and directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are maintained by the Company or any such Subsidiary or
otherwise reflected on the Company Balance Sheet are, and will at the
Effective Time be, owned by the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may
be, free and clear of any claims thereon by the officers, directors or members
of their families. Any BOLI policy owned by the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company complies with the requirements of 12 C.F.R. § 248.10(c)(7) or, in
the case of a BOLI policy owned by the Company Bank, 12 C.F.R. § 351.10(c)(7).

appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under the circumstances in

involving Buyer or Buyer Bank, and Buyer shall be reasonably responsive to
requests by the Company for information relating to the Buyers
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement. Neither

(c) Buyer and the Company agree to hold all information and documents obtained
pursuant to this Section 6.4 in confidence (as provided in, and subject to the
provisions of, the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.2), as
if it were the party receiving the confidential information as described

partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Proposal, (C) approve, endorse or enter into any letter of intent, agreement,
contract, commitment or agreement in principle (other than an Acceptable

with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement, contract
or commitment or other arrangement requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate, breach or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (D) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing; and

 



 

(ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any existing
solicitations, encouragements, discussions or negotiations with any Third

Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and afford such Third Party
access to the businesses, properties, assets and personnel of the Company and

or negotiations with the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal
regarding such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise cooperate with or assist or
participate in, or facilitate, any such discussions or negotiations or take
any of the actions otherwise prohibited by Section 6.5(a); _provided, however_
, that the Company (1) will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its or
their respective Representatives not to, furnish any non-public information
except pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (2) will
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to Buyer any information
or other data concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries or access provided to
such Third Party, in each case which was not previously provided to Buyer.

Proposal or other inquiry, proposal or offer, and the material terms and
conditions thereof (including any change in price or form of consideration or

(d) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person
from, or to waive or permit the waiver or termination of any provision of, any
standstill or similar agreement to which any of the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company is a party, other than to the extent the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to provide such waiver, release or termination would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.5, the Company
agrees that in the event any Subsidiary or Representative takes any action
which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach by the Company of

Section 6.5.

(b) (i) Subject to the Companys compliance with Sections 6.5 and 6.6, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
may, if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
(A) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal received after the date hereof or (B) cause the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) and authorize the Company to enter
into a definitive agreement providing for a transaction that constitutes a
Superior Proposal (which agreement shall be entered into substantially
concurrently with such termination), subject in each case to compliance with
the terms of paragraph (ii) below, as applicable.

 



 

(ii) In the case of a Superior Proposal, (x) no Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this Section 6.6(b) may be made and (y) no termination of this

identity of the Third Party making, such Superior Proposal, and a copy of any
other relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal, which shall require
a new notice period of three Business Days, and compliance with this 6.6(b)
6.6(b) with respect to such new notice);

 



 

(B) unless during such five Business Day period (or three Business Day period
following an amended proposal), the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and
shall cause their respective Representatives to, to the extent requested by
Buyer, negotiate with Buyer and its Representatives in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company Board to maintain the Company Recommendation and not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement; and

 



 

(C) unless, following the expiration of such five Business Day period (or
three Business Day period following an amended proposal), the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into consideration any amendments
to this Agreement proposed by Buyer, (x) that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law and (y) that such Acquisition Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in Section 6.5 or this Section 6.6 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act; (ii) making any disclosure to the
Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board or
any committee thereof, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law or any disclosure requirements under
applicable law; _provided, however_ , that the Company and the Company Board
may not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change except as

 



      
 

 



 

permitted by Section 6.6(b)(ii); and (iii) making any disclosure that
constitutes a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication

Act, which actions shall not, in and of themselves, constitute or be deemed to
constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

6.7 _Takeover Laws_. No party shall take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Laws, as applicable, and each party shall take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued

necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover

all documentation, effect all filings and obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the Regulatory Approvals, and (b) to comply
with the terms and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Buyer be required
to agree to any prohibition, limitation, condition or other requirement which
would (A) prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by the

all or any material portion of the business or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) compel Buyer or any

take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
request, if the prohibition, limitation, condition or other requirement
described in clauses (A)-(C) of this sentence would have a material adverse
effect on the future operation by Buyer and its Subsidiaries of their
business, taken as a whole (together, the " _Burdensome Conditions_ ").
Provided that the Company has cooperated as required above, Buyer agrees to
file the requisite applications or notices to be filed by it with the FRB, the
FDIC and the Commissioner. Each of Buyer and the Company shall have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the
other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of

any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as

6.9 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of
liability existing in favor of any director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Companys
Charter or Bylaws or in the similar governing documents of the Companys
Subsidiaries or as provided in applicable law as in effect as of the date
hereof with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time,
including without limitation the right to advancement of expenses, shall
survive the Merger.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys directors and
officers in a form acceptable to the Company which shall provide such
directors and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective
Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms at
least as favorable to, the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company, so long as
the aggregate cost is not more than 200% of the annual premium currently paid
by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Limit_ "). In the event that
the Premium Limit is insufficient for such coverage, the Company may enter
into an agreement to spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser coverage
as may be obtained with such amount.

 



 

(c) In the event Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and to grant third party rights to, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

 



 

6.10 _Employees and Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) After the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to provide the employees of the
Company and Company Bank who remain employed after the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with at least the types and
levels of employee benefits comparable in the aggregate to those then
maintained by Buyer for similarly-situated employees of Buyer (but excluding
any retiree health or life insurance benefit, in each case only to the extent
that other newly hired employees of Buyer are not eligible for such benefits).
Buyer will treat, and cause its applicable Buyer Employee Programs to treat,
the service of the Continuing Employees as service rendered to Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for
level of benefits (but not for benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan
for purposes of severance benefits, for any purposes under any post-
termination/retiree welfare benefit plan or for purposes of any equity based
compensation) attributable to any period before the Effective Time. Without
limiting the foregoing, but subject to the terms and conditions of Buyers
applicable Buyer Employee Programs, Buyer shall cause the Companys employees
to receive credit for

 



      
 

 



 

their prior service for eligibility and vesting purposes in Buyers 401(k)
plan and for purposes of determining the length of vacation, sick time, paid
time off and severance under the Buyers applicable plan or policy. Buyer
shall also ensure that Continuing Employees shall not be treated as "new"
employees for purposes of any exclusions under any health or similar plan of
Buyer for a pre-existing medical condition to the extent that any such
exclusion did not apply under a health or similar plan of the Company or
Company Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time, and to provide that any
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket expenses paid under any of the
Companys or Company Banks health plans shall be credited towards
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket expenses under Buyers health plans
upon delivery to Buyer of appropriate documentation, subject to the terms and
conditions of the applicable Buyer Employee Program. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.10, service and other amounts shall not
be credited to Continuing Employees (or their eligible dependents) to the
extent the crediting of such service or other amounts would result in the
duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary,
none of the provisions contained herein shall operate to duplicate any benefit
provided to any Continuing Employee or the funding of any such benefit.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer shall
have sole discretion with respect to the determination as to whether or when
to terminate, merge or continue any employee benefit plans and programs of the
Company, subject to limitations set forth under applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively
terminates coverage (or causes coverage to terminate) under a Company or
Company Bank health plan prior to the time such Continuing Employee becomes
eligible to participate in the Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary health plan, no
coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall
terminate under any of the Company or Company Bank health plans prior to the
time such Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to
participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees
of the Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary and their dependents.

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to honor and perform, in
accordance with their terms, all contractual rights of current and former
employees of the Company or Company Bank existing as of the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, all employment, severance, deferred
compensation and change in control agreements of the Company and Company Bank
listed in _Schedule 6.10(c)_.

 



 

(d) If requested by Buyer no later than 30 days prior to Closing, the Company
shall terminate its 401(k) plan effective as of the day prior to the Effective
Time (but contingent upon the occurrence thereof) and adopt all required
compliance amendments pursuant to written resolutions, the form and substance
of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. If the Company 401(k) plan
is terminated, Buyer agrees to permit participants in the Company 401(k) plan
who are continuing employees of the Buyer to roll over their account balances
and outstanding loan balances from such plan to the Buyers 401(k) plan, and
such continuing employees who satisfy the eligibility requirements of Buyers
401(k) plan (taking into account credit for prior years of service with the
Company pursuant to Section 6.10(a)) shall be eligible to immediately
participate in the Buyers 401(k) plan.

 



 

(e) Buyer agrees to honor the severance guidelines attached as _Schedule
6.10(e)_ in connection with the termination of employment of any employee of
the Company or

 



      
 

 



 

Company Bank, other than an employee who is a party to an employment
agreement, change in control agreement or other separation agreement that
provides a benefit on a termination of employment, whose employment is
terminated involuntarily (other than for Cause, as defined in _Schedule
6.10(e)_ ) within one year following the Effective Time, by providing a lump
sum severance payment in such amounts, at such times and upon such conditions
as set forth on said Schedule, including without limitation the effectiveness
of a separation agreement with the terminated employee of the Company or
Company Bank in a form as determined by Buyer, which includes, without
limitation, a release of legal claims.

 



 

(f) Within 45 days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall designate, in
consultation with the Company, certain employees of the Company or Company
Bank who will be entitled to receive a retention bonus from Buyer in the event
such employee remains a Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date and/or
through a post-Closing transition period to be determined by Buyer, including
systems conversion, if applicable.

 



 

(g) From the date hereof through the Closing, the Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Bank to, provide Buyer with reasonable access (at reasonable
times, upon reasonable notice and in a manner that will not materially
interfere with the normal operations of the Company) to the (i) employees of
the Company and Company Bank and (ii) the Companys human resources personnel
and personnel records (to the extent not prohibited by applicable law) for
purposes of (A) facilitating an orderly transition of such employees from and
after the Closing, (B) making announcements concerning, and preparing for the
consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (C)
engaging, communicating or meeting with and/or presenting to such employees on
either an individual or group basis with respect to matters related to their
prospective continued employment with Buyer on and after the Closing. The
Company and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with each
other, and will consider in good faith each others advice, prior to sending
any notices or other communication materials to the employees of the Company
and Company Bank regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the effects thereof
on the employment, compensation or benefits of such employees and, in any
case, any such notice or communication materials shall comply with applicable
law.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.10
shall (h) be treated as an amendment of any particular Employee Program or any
other employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement or (ii)
give any third party, including any Continuing Employee, any former employee
of the Company or Company Bank or any beneficiary representative thereof, any
right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.10. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to (x) confer upon any employee of the Company or
Company Bank, any Continuing Employee or any other Person any right to
continued employment after the Effective Time or (y) prevent Buyer or any of
its Affiliates from amending, modifying or terminating any Employee Program or
any other employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement in
accordance with the terms of such Employee Program.

 



 

(i) The ESOP shall be terminated, effective as of or immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the outstanding ESOP obligation shall be repaid to the
Company, in full from the shares in the ESOP suspense account, assuming a
value equal to the Merger Consideration.

 



      
 

 



 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt an amendment to the ESOP
(the " _ESOP Termination Amendment_ ") that will terminate the ESOP effective
as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Bank, and
after the Effective Time, the Buyer Bank shall cause the Committee (as defined
in the ESOP) and the ESOP Trustee to take all other actions and prepare all
documents necessary in furtherance of the termination and the administration
of the ESOP until all assets thereunder are distributed, including, without
limitation, preparing and filing all necessary documents with the IRS to
request a favorable determination letter, which actions and documentation
shall be subject to the reasonable review of Buyer.

 



 

6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Buyer will
give prompt notice to the other (and will subsequently keep the other informed
on a reasonably current basis of any material developments related to such
notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact,
event or circumstance that (i) has, (x) with respect to the Company, had or
would reasonably be expected have a Company Material Adverse Effect and (y)
with respect to Buyer or Merger LLC, had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, (ii) is reasonably likely to result in
any of the conditions set forth in Article VII not being able to be satisfied
prior to the Outside Date. No notification given by any party pursuant to this
Section 6.11 shall limit or otherwise affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement
or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than
15 days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall furnish to Buyer (a) consolidated financial

stockholders equity) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of and
for such month then ended, (b) internal management financial control reports
showing actual financial performance against plan and previous period (to be

thereof relating to the financial performance and risk management of the

6.13 _Certain Tax Matters_. During the period from the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to: (a) timely file (taking into account any extensions of time

Returns shall be prepared in a manner reasonably consistent with past
practice; (b) timely pay all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax

of any Transaction Litigation and shall keep Buyer informed on a reasonably
prompt basis regarding any such Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall
give Buyer the opportunity to

 



       
 

 



 

(a) participate in the defense of any Transaction Litigation, and (b) consult
with counsel to the Company regarding the defense, settlement or compromise
with respect to any such Transaction Litigation. For purposes of this Section
6.14, "participate" means that Buyer will be kept reasonably apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the
Transaction Litigation, and Buyer may offer comments or suggestions with
respect to such Transaction Litigation which the Company shall consider in

Article IV of this Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as of

shall be true and correct in all respects only as of such earlier date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to
"materiality" or words of similar import) would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect;
except that the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.9
(Sufficient Funds) shall be true and correct in all respects (without giving
effect to any materiality or Buyer Material Adverse Effect qualifications set

one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, may rely on the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, as the case
may be, to be satisfied (or to be able to be satisfied) to excuse it from its
obligation to effect the Merger if such failure (or inability to be satisfied)
was caused by such partys failure to comply with or perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

irrevocably and unconditionally consents to and submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in the State of Maryland
(" _Maryland Courts_ ") in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined only in any such Maryland Courts, and (c) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such Maryland Courts. Each of the parties
hereto waives any defense or inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
action or proceeding so brought in any such Maryland Courts and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party in
any such Maryland Courts with respect thereto. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, any party hereto may make service on another party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.5. Nothing
in this Section 9.10, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law. EACH

 



      
 

 



 

OF BUYER, MERGER LLC AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any
other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the
non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek (i) a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation, and (ii) an injunction, without the posting of any
bond, restraining such breach or threatened breach.

 



 

9.12 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Voting Agreements and any
documents delivered by the parties in connection herewith constitutes the
entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof.

 



 

9.13 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in
any respect by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement and the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
substitute a valid, legal, and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this Agreement.
