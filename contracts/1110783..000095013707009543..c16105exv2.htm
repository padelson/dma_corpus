herein, to the Employees listed by title on <U>Schedule&nbsp;5.19(a)</U>. For the purposes of this

are reasonably deemed necessary by Purchaser. Any special agreement, litigation, investigatory
documents or materials otherwise related to employment legalities concerning the Continuing
Employees in the possession of the Seller shall be provided to the Purchaser. Seller shall provide
reasonable access to the Employees prior to Closing solely for the purposes of informational
meetings regarding benefits and employment matters generally; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that (i)&nbsp;Purchaser

19</U>, 2007, by and among Monsanto Company, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Monsanto</U>&#148;), and Bayer
CropScience LP, a Delaware limited partnership (&#147;<U>Bayer</U>&#148;).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of May&nbsp;31, 2007 (the &#147;<U>Stock
Purchase Agreement</U>&#148;), by and among Monsanto and Bayer, Bayer has agreed to purchase and
Monsanto has agreed to sell, to Bayer all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
Stoneville Pedigreed Seed Company, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Stoneville</U>&#148;), among other
things (the &#147;<U>Acquisition</U>&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Bayer has conditioned its
obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement on Monsanto&#146;s execution and delivery of this Release
in order to protect Bayer and Stoneville from the liabilities released herein;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in view of the foregoing, Monsanto and Bayer desire to execute and deliver this
Release; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Stock Purchase Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the
contemplated transactions and the value and benefits that Monsanto has received and will receive
thereunder, including, without limitation, the Purchase Price payable to Monsanto and the other
consideration described in the Stock Purchase Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and as a material
inducement to Bayer to enter into and satisfy its obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement,
Monsanto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agrees as follows:

Affiliates and subsidiaries and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,

Monsanto), bonds, bills, contracts, controversies, promises, damages, judgments, claims,

arising under the Stock Purchase Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby,
including without limitation, the Ancillary Agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monsanto specifically understands, acknowledges and agrees that except for the exclusions
specifically set forth in this Section&nbsp;1 of this Release, this is a full and final release,
applying to all of the Claims, whether known or unknown, against Releasees. Except for the
exclusions specifically set forth in this Section&nbsp;1 of this Release, this Release is in full
accord, satisfaction and discharge of all of the Claims against Releasees, and has been executed
with the express intention of effectuating the full and final extinguishment of all such Claims.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <U>Covenant Not to Sue</U>. Monsanto hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain
from directly or indirectly asserting any claim or demand, and from commencing,
instituting, or causing to be commenced, any proceeding of any kind against any
Releasee, based upon any Claim purported to be released hereby.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <U>Indemnification</U>. Without in any way limiting any of the rights and
remedies otherwise available to any Releasee, Monsanto shall indemnify and hold harmless
each Releasee from and against any and all loss, damage (including incidental and
consequential damages), injury, harm, detriment, lost opportunity, liability, exposure,
claim, demand, settlement, judgment, award, fine, penalty, tax, fee (including
attorneys&#146; fees), charge or expense (whether or not relating to any third-party claim)
directly or indirectly arising from, relating to, in connection with or by virtue of (a)
the assertion Monsanto of any Claim purported to be released pursuant to this Release,
(b)&nbsp;any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by Monsanto in
this Release, or (c)&nbsp;any failure on the part of Monsanto to observe, perform or abide
by, or any other breach by Monsanto of, any restriction, covenant, obligation or other
provision contained in this Release.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <U>Specific Performance</U>. Monsanto agrees that the Releasees would be
damaged irreparably in the event that any material provision of this Release were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached and that money
damages would be an inadequate remedy for any such nonperformance or breach.
Accordingly, Monsanto agrees that each of the Releasees shall be entitled, in addition
to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent any breach or threatened breach of any of such provisions and to specific
performance of the terms of this Release (without posting a bond or other security).

covenants set forth in this Release (a)&nbsp;are essential elements of this Release, and
without Monsanto&#146;s agreement to comply with such terms and covenants, Bayer would not
have entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement; (b)&nbsp;are manifestly reasonable on their

the protection of the Releasees.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <U>No Inducement</U>. Monsanto represents and warrants that: (a)&nbsp;no promise
or inducement has been offered to Monsanto in exchange for executing and delivering this
Release except as set forth herein or in the Stock Purchase Agreement; (b)&nbsp;this Release
is being executed by Monsanto without reliance upon any statement or representation by
