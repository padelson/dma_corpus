 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement"_ ") is made and entered into as of January 27, 2006 by and among United Surgical Partners International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Peak ASC Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Surgis, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Company_ "): 

  

 A. The boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and have determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, their respective stockholders. 

  

 B. In connection with the Merger, among other things, the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), will be converted into the right to receive cash from Parent at the rate set forth herein. 

  

 C. Prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options (as defined below) and/or Company Warrants (as defined below) at the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Equityholders_ ") will enter into a Joinder Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (each, a " _Joinder Agreement_ ") pursuant to which each such holder will become a party to this Agreement and pursuant to which each such holder shall appoint New Mountain Partners, L.P. as its representative (the " _Shareholder Representative_ "). 

  

 D. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this Agreement, New Mountain Partners, L.P. and New Mountain Affiliated Investors, L.P. (collectively, " _New Mountain_ ") _,_ will enter into an agreement pursuant to which New Mountain will agree, among other things, to vote for the approval of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and against any alternative Acquisition Proposals (as defined herein), notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined below) at a duly called meeting of the stockholders of Company or, in lieu of a meeting, by executing an action by written consent of the stockholders of Company (the " _Support Agreement_ "). 

  

 The parties agree as follows:

If the Delaware Secretary requires any changes in the Certificate of Merger as a condition to filing or issuing a certificate to the effect that the Merger is effective, Merger Sub, Parent and/or Company shall execute any necessary document incorporating such changes, provided such changes are not inconsistent with and do not result in any material change in the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of DGCL.

 1.6 _Merger Consideration_. 

   

 (a) Subject to _Sections_ _2.7,_ _5.14_ and _5.15_ and subject to the adjustments provided for in _Section 1.7_ and _Section 1.8_, cash in the amount of $200,000,000 _minus_ (A) the Closing Indebtedness Amount (as defined in _Section 1.6(c)_ below) _minus_ (B) the 

   #####

 (b) For purposes of determining the amounts to be initially paid to the Company Equityholders pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and _Sections 2.3(b) and (f)_ and the amount to be deposited with the Escrow Agent (as defined below) on the Closing Date (the aggregate of such amounts, prior to any deduction for applicable withholding taxes, the " _Initial Merger Consideration_ "), Company shall provide to Parent not later than three business days prior to the Closing Date a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "), with reasonable detail and otherwise in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, certified by the Chief Financial Officer of Company and setting forth: 

   

 (i) Companys calculation of the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses, the Tax Benefits, the Closing Cash Amount and the Employee Transaction Payments, in each case, together with a breakdown of such amounts, and, where applicable, showing the amounts owed to each person who is owed any such amounts (together with any customary payoff letters and invoices reasonably requested by Parent); 

   

 (ii) an equity capitalization table of Company listing all record holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants as of a date not less than five business days prior to the Closing Date, together with (x) a table specifying the percentages of the Initial Merger Consideration payable to each Company Equityholder pursuant to _Article II_ prior to any deduction for applicable withholding (such percentage, with respect to each Company Equityholder, its " _Pro Rata Share_ "), (y) the proper names and addresses of all such holders and any other information requested by Parent in connection with the determination of any withholding taxes associated with payment of Merger Consideration; and (z) in the case of Company Options and Company Warrants, a schedule identifying the exercise prices thereof; and 

   

 (iii) Companys estimate of the Closing Working Capital (as defined below) calculated in accordance with _Section 1.7_ below (such estimate, as the same may be adjusted in response to comments of Parent provided prior to the Closing, the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "). 

 

The Closing Statement shall be prepared by Company in good faith in
consultation with Parent and its Representatives (as defined below). In
connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement, Company shall
provide Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal

and the Company Subsidiaries (as defined below) for purposes of assisting
Parent and its Representatives in their review of the Closing Statement.
Prior to Closing, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any
reasonable questions or issues raised by Parent in connection with its review
of the Closing Statement. If prior to the

business day prior to the Effective Time prompt notice of such change and a
revised Closing Statement.

 (d) As used herein, " _Seller Transaction Expenses_ " means all obligations and liabilities incurred by Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Equityholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or incurred in anticipation of such transactions or any alternative transactions considered by Company to the extent such obligations and liabilities are payable or reimbursable by Company or any Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, including (A) all accrued fees, costs and expenses of investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other consultants and advisors as of the Effective Time, (B) all amounts payable in connection with such transactions under the Advisory Agreement, dated as of November 4, 2002 between Company and New Mountain Capital, LLC (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the " _New Mountain Advisory Agreement_ ") as of the Effective Time, (C) all other obligations and liabilities that are accrued and unpaid under the New Mountain Advisory Agreement as of the Effective Time and (D) the costs of obtaining a "tail" directors and officers insurance policy as contemplated by _Section 5.7(b)_ that are accrued and unpaid as of the Effective Time; _provided_ , that Seller Transaction Expenses shall not include any Additional Audit Expenses (as defined below), Employee Transaction Payments or severance obligations and liabilities of Company arising out of the Merger and the related transactions.

 (f) As used herein, _"Closing Cash Amount"_ shall mean all cash and cash equivalents of Company and the Consolidated Company Subsidiaries (whether or not its use is restricted to certain designated purposes) as reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet _less_ any amounts used between the time of determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Effective Time which are used to satisfy or pay any Closing Indebtedness Amounts or Seller Transaction Expenses. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) As used herein, _"Employee Transaction Payments"_ shall mean the transaction bonus payments described on _Schedule 1.6(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Statement that shall be made by Company to the employees of Company identified on such _Schedule 1.6(g)_ in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date, which amount shall equal $620,000. 

  

 1.7 _Working Capital and Other Adjustments_. 

  

 (a) Not later than four (4) business days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent a statement of Base Working Capital. _"Base Working Capital"_ shall be calculated by subtracting Base Current Liabilities from Base Current Assets. _"Base Current Assets"_ means the current assets of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as set forth on the audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 contained in the Audited Financial Statements (as defined below) (the _"2005 Balance Sheet"_ ) less, to the extent reflected in the 2005 Balance Sheet, (i) all cash and cash equivalents of Company and the Company Subsidiaries (whether or not its use is restricted to certain designated purposes) as reflected on the 2005 Balance Sheet, (ii) all current deferred tax assets and (iii) all receivables related to insurance proceeds. _"Base Current Liabilities"_ means the current liabilities of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as set forth on the 2005 Balance Sheet less, to the extent reflected in the 2005 Balance Sheet, (i) all obligations (including all obligations in respect of principal, penalties, fees and premiums, but excluding accrued interest) of Company and the Consolidated Company Subsidiaries for borrowed money, evidenced by notes, bonds, debentures or similar instruments (including under Companys revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A.), (ii) the amount of all capitalized lease obligations determined in accordance with GAAP of Company and the Consolidated Company Subsidiaries, (iii) all accruals related to Seller Transaction Expenses, and (iv) all current deferred tax liabilities. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event that Company takes the action with respect to West Houston described in _Section 5.14(b)_, appropriate adjustments shall be made in determining Base Working Capital and Closing Working Capital to reflect the disposition of West Houston as contemplated by _Section 5.14(b)_. 

  

 (b) The Initial Merger Consideration shall be (i) increased on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital is greater than Base Working Capital and (ii) reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital is less than Base Working Capital. 

  

 (c) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent will deliver to the Shareholder Representative an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Company as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the _"Closing Date Balance Sheet"_ ) together with a statement (the  _"Closing Working Capital Statement"_ ) of Closing Working Capital. The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared using the same accounting methods, principles, practices, procedures and estimation methodologies as those utilized in preparing the 2005 Balance Sheet. The Closing Working Capital Statement shall set forth a calculation of Closing Working Capital. _"Closing Working Capital"_ shall be calculated by subtracting Adjusted Closing Current Liabilities from Adjusted Closing Current Assets. _"Adjusted Closing Current Assets"_ means the current assets of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as set forth on the Closing Date Balance Sheet 

   ##### 

  

 

less, to the extent reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet, (i) all
amounts relating to the Closing Cash Amount, (ii) all current deferred
tax assets, and (iii) all amounts relating to the Tax Benefits. _"Adjusted
Closing Current Liabilities"_  means the current liabilities of the Company
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as set forth on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet less, to the extent reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet, (i)
all obligations (including all obligations in respect of principal,
penalties, fees and premiums, but excluding accrued interest) of Company and
the Consolidated Company Subsidiaries for borrowed money, evidenced by notes,
bonds, debentures or similar instruments (including under Companys revolving
credit facility with Bank of America, N.A.), (ii) the amount of all
capitalized lease obligations determined in accordance with GAAP of Company
and the Consolidated Company Subsidiaries, (iii) all accruals relating to
Seller Transaction Expenses, (iv) all accruals relating to the Additional
Audit Expenses, (v) all accruals relating to the Employee
Transaction Payments (vi) all current deferred tax liabilities and (vii) all
accruals for severance relating to the Merger and the related transactions.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
amounts included in the clause (A) or (B) of the definition of
Closing Indebtedness Amount, Seller Transaction Expenses, Tax Benefits, the
Closing Cash Amount and the Employee Transaction Payments for purposes of
determining the Merger Consideration also be taken into account for purposes
of determining Closing Working Capital. 

   

 (d) At the time of delivery of the Closing Working Capital Statement, Parent shall also provide to the Shareholder Representative a statement (the _"Consideration Adjustment Statement_ ") containing a calculation of the Closing Indebtedness Amount, Seller Transaction Expenses and the Closing Cash Amount, in each case, derived from the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Tax Benefits derived from the actual Option Price taking into account any adjustments to the Merger Consideration effected pursuant to _Section 1.8_, and the Employee Transaction Payments derived from the actual amounts paid to employees receiving Employee Transaction Payments at or prior to the Closing. 

  

 (e) The Shareholder Representative may dispute the amount of Closing Working Capital specified on the Closing Working Capital Statement, and/or any or all of the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses, the Closing Cash Amount, the Tax Benefits and the Employee Transaction Payments specified on the Consideration Adjustment Statement by delivering to Parent, within 45 days after delivery to the Shareholder Representative of the Closing Working Capital Statement, a notice (a _"Dispute Notice"_ ) of such dispute setting forth in reasonable detail the Shareholder Representatives calculation of Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses, the Closing Cash Amount, the Tax Benefits or the Employee Transaction Payments, and a reasonably detailed description of the basis for the dispute. In the case of Closing Working Capital, the only basis permitted for such a dispute is that Closing Working Capital was not determined in accordance with _Section 1.7(c)_ above. In the case of a dispute relating to Closing Working Capital, except as may be specified in such Dispute Notice, the Shareholder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed that all other requirements of the Closing Working Capital Statement have been complied with and that all other calculations and amounts contained in the Closing Working Capital Statement are correct. In the case of the Tax Benefits, the only basis permitted for such a dispute is that the aggregate Option Price used to determine Tax Benefits did not reflect the actual Share Price, taking into account the adjustments contemplated by _Section 1.8_. In the case of the Employee Transaction Payments, the only basis 

   ##### 

  

 

permitted for such a dispute is that the aggregate amount does not reflect the
amounts actually paid. Any Dispute Notice must specify, with reasonable
particularity, all facts that form the basis of such disagreements and all
statements by persons (who shall be identified by name) and documents relied
upon by the Shareholder Representative as forming the basis of such
disagreement. Any facts, statements or documents not identified with
reasonable particularity in the Dispute Notice may not be cited by the
Shareholder Representative in any written submission, nor offered by the
Shareholder Representative into evidence or the record, at any proceeding
conducted pursuant to  _Section 1.7(f)_, or in any ancillary, enforcement or
other proceedings brought in connection therewith. 

   

 (f) If a Dispute Notice shall be duly delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(e)_, Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall, during the 30 days following such delivery, use their reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed matters referred to in the Dispute Notice in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses, the Closing Cash Amount, the Tax Benefits and the Employee Transaction Payments. Closing Working Capital and the Closing Cash Amount shall not be less than the amount thereof shown in Parents calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(c)_ or _Section 1.7(d)_, respectively, nor more than the amount thereof shown in the Shareholder Representatives calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(e)_. The Closing Indebtedness Amount and the Seller Transaction Expenses shall not be more than the amount thereof shown in Parents calculation delivered pursuant to _Section_   _1.7(d)_ , nor less than the amount thereof shown in the Shareholder Representatives calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(e)_. The Tax Benefits shall be determined based on the actual Option Price as determined after taking into account all adjustments contemplated by Section 1.8. The Employee Transaction Payments shall be determined based on the aggregate actual Employee Transaction Payments made by the Company at or prior to the Closing, which in no event shall exceed $620,000. If, during such period, Parent and the Shareholder Representative are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause Ernst and Young LLP or, if such firm is unable to serve in such capacity, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if neither such firm is able to serve in such capacity, another firm of independent accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Shareholder Representative (which shall not have or have had any material relationship with Parent or the Shareholder Representative) promptly to review this Agreement and such disputed matters for the purpose of determining, as may be required, the amount of Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses, the Closing Cash Amount, the Tax Benefits and the Employee Transaction Payments. In any such case, a single partner having special expertise with respect to settlement of such disputes of the selected accounting firm shall act for the firm in the determination proceeding, and such partner shall render a written decision as to each such disputed matter, as promptly as practicable, including a statement in reasonable detail of the basis for each such decision. In making such determination, such partner of the selected firm shall consider only those matters properly specified in the Shareholders Representatives Dispute Notice in accordance with _Section 1.7(e)_. Such decision shall be final and binding upon Parent, the Shareholder Representative and the Company Equityholders and will be fully enforceable. In the event the review involves a review of Closing Working Capital, the cost of such review and decision shall be borne (i) by the Company Equityholders if the difference between Final Working Capital and Shareholder Representatives calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to  _Section 1.7(e)_ is greater than the difference 

   ##### 

  

    

between Final Working Capital and Parents calculation of Closing Working
Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(c)_, (ii) by Parent if the first
such difference is less than the second such difference and (iii) otherwise
equally by Parent and the Company Equityholders. If the review does not
involve a review of Closing Working Capital, (i) by the Company Equityholders
if the Company Equityholders are required to make a payment pursuant to
_Section 1.8(a)_, (ii) by Parent if Parent is required to make a
payment pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ and (iii) otherwise equally by Parent
and the Company Equityholders. 

  

 (g) Parent and the Shareholder Representative agree that they will, and Parent agrees to cause Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, until such time as Final Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses, the Closing Cash Amount, the Tax Benefits and the Employee Transaction Payments have been determined in accordance with this _Section 1.7_, cooperate and assist in the preparation and review of the Closing Working Capital Statement and the determination of Closing Working Capital, the preparation and review of the Consideration Adjustment Statement and the determination of the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses, the Closing Cash Amount, the Tax Benefits and the Employee Transaction Payments, and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this _Section 1.7_, including, and as promptly as practicable (but in any case prior to the expiration of the 30-day period referred to in _Section 1.7(f)_), subject to normal procedures associated with such preparation and reviews, by making available books, accounting records and work papers, by delivering copies thereof, and by using all reasonable efforts to make available the persons identified in the Dispute Notice and other personnel, as reasonably requested by the other party, and to make such representations as are customarily required by independent accountants in connection with such preparation and reviews; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any failure of either party to comply with this _Section 1.7(g)_ shall not be a breach of this Agreement unless the other party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

  

 1.8 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. 

   

 (a) If Final Working Capital is less than Estimated Working Capital, the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall cause the Escrow Agent (as defined herein) to pay to Parent, as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration, in the manner and with interest as provided in _Section 1.8(b)_ , the difference between Estimated Working Capital and Final Working Capital. If Final Working Capital exceeds Estimated Working Capital, Parent shall pay to the Shareholder Representative for distribution to the Company Equityholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, in the manner and with interest as provided in _Section 1.8(b)_, the difference between Final Working Capital and Estimated Working Capital. _"Final Working Capital"_  means the Closing Working Capital (i) as shown in Parents calculation delivered pursuant to  _Section 1.7(c)_, if no Dispute Notice is duly delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(e)_, or (ii) if such a Dispute Notice is delivered, (A) as agreed by Parent and the Shareholder Representative pursuant to _Section 1.7(f)_ or (B) in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the independent accountants determination delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(f)_;  _provided,_ that in no event shall Final Working Capital be less than Parents calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(c)_ or more than the Shareholder Representatives calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(e)_. If the Closing Indebtedness Amount _plus_ the Seller Transaction Expenses  _minus_ the Closing Cash Amount 

   ##### 

  

 

 _minus_ the Tax Benefits _minus_ the Employee Transaction Payments, as
finally determined pursuant to Section 1.7, exceeds the Closing Indebtedness
Amount _plus_ the Seller Transaction Expenses _minus_ the Closing Cash Amount
_minus_ the Tax Benefits _minus_ the Employee Transaction Payments, as set
forth on the Closing Statement, then the Shareholder Representative and
Parent shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent, as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration, in the manner and with interest as provided in _Section
1.8(b)_, the amount of such excess. If the Closing Indebtedness Amount _plus_
the Seller Transaction Expenses _minus_ the Closing Cash Amount _minus_ the
Tax Benefits _minus_ the Employee Transaction Payments, as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.7, are less than the Closing Indebtedness Amount _plus_
the Seller Transaction Expenses _minus_ the Closing Cash Amount _minus_ the
Tax Benefits minus the Employee Transaction Payment, as set forth on the
Closing Statement, then Parent shall pay to the Shareholder Representative
for distribution to the Company Equityholders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares, in the manner and with interest as provided in
_Section 1.8(b)_ , as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration, the amount
of such shortfall. For administrative convenience, amounts payable under this
_Section 1.8(a)_ shall be netted. 

   

 (b) Any net payment due pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ shall be made within five days after the Final Working Capital has been determined. If payment pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ is required to be made by Parent, such payment shall be made to the Shareholder Representative for distribution to the Company Equityholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. If payment pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ is required to be made by the Company Equityholders, the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall direct the Escrow Agent to make payment by wire transfer to an account specified by Parent. In the event that the funds in the escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (as defined below) are insufficient to pay such amounts to Parent, such amounts shall be treated as Losses subject to indemnification under _Section 9.1(a)_ (without giving effect to any of the limitations set forth in  _Section 9.3_). The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES; TREATMENT OF_ 
  _COMPANY OPTIONS AND WARRANTS_   

  

 2.1 _Conversion of Shares; Treatment of Company Options and Company Warrants_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holders of any outstanding shares of capital stock or securities of Company or Merger Sub: 

   

 (a) Subject to _Sections 2.6_ and _2.7_ , each share of Company Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares (as defined herein)), shall be automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Share Price (as defined below). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and 

   ##### 

  

 

retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously
representing any such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Share Price. 

   

 (b) Each option to purchase Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Options_ "), shall be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Share Price less the exercise price of such Company Option (the " _Option Price_ "). 

  

 (c) Each warrant to purchase Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Warrants_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Share Price less the exercise price of such Company Warrant (the " _Warrant Price_ "). All such Company Warrants, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such securities shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Warrant Price. 

  

 (d) Each holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Company Common Stock, without interest. 

  

 (e) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of a number of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed to evidence ownership of the same number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Share Price_ " is the Merger Consideration _plus_ the total exercise price of all Company Options _plus_ the total exercise price of all Company Warrants _less_ the aggregate amount of the Employee Transaction Payments, divided by the sum of (A) the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Company Options and the Company Warrants. 

  

 (g) Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, the Share Price, Option Price and Warrant Price shall each be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), extraordinary dividend or distribution, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring or having a record date or an effective date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 2.2 _Company Options and Warrants_. 

   

 (a) Prior to and effective as of the Effective Time, Company, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Board_ ") and each relevant committee of the Board shall take such actions as are necessary to obtain (i), if necessary, the written consent of the holder of 

   ##### 

  

 

each Company Option to the cancellation of the Company Options and (ii) the
written consent of the holder of the Company Warrants to the cancellation of
the Company Warrants in accordance with this _Section 2.2_. Subject to
having obtained any necessary consents from the holders of Company Options and
Company Warrants, the Company shall cause the Board or each relevant
committee of the Board to adopt any amendments to the plans of the Company
Options (the " _Company Option Plans_ ") or the agreements in connection with
the Company Options (the " _Company Option Agreements_ ") and the Company
Warrants which may be necessary or desirable to implement such
cancellations. 

   

 (b) Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that all Company Option Agreements related to Company Options and Company Warrants shall be terminated as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any Company Option Plan or any other plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of Company shall be modified as of no later than the Effective Time to conform to the provisions of this Agreement regarding treatment of Company Options. Further, Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of a Company Option Agreement or any participant in any Company Option Plan or any holder of the Company Warrants or any other plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of Company or the Surviving Corporation or any interest in respect of any capital stock of Company or the Surviving Corporation other than the right to receive cash as set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") with a bank or trust company selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company to act as the paying agent for the payment of Merger Consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants (the " _Paying Agent_ "). 

  

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall supply or cause to be supplied to or for the account of the Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants and for exchange pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ the Merger Consideration (net of required tax withholdings) payable to the Company Equityholders pursuant to _Section 2.1_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash held by it under the Paying Agent Agreement as directed by Parent and any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be for the benefit of Parent. Any portion of such funds which remain undistributed for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and the Holders (as defined below) who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.3_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, subject to escheat and abandoned property and similar laws. 

  

 (c) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no event later than two business days after the Effective Time), Parent shall mail or shall cause to be mailed to each Holder a letter of transmittal in customary form (or, in the case of holders of Company Options, such other instruments as may be reasonably required to effect payment of the Option Price to such Holder) and, in each case reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Shareholder 

    ##### 

 

     

Representative (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Company Certificates and Company Warrants shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Certificates and
Company Warrants to the Paying Agent) and instructions for surrender of the
Company Certificates and the Company Warrants. Upon surrender to the Paying
Agent of a Company Certificate or Company Warrant, together with such letter
of transmittal duly executed (and any enclosures or other documents required
thereby), or, in the case of a Holder of Company Options, such other
instrument, the Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration payable to such Holder in accordance with _Section
2.1_, and such Company Certificate or Company Warrant so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No Merger Consideration will be distributed to a person
in respect of a Company Certificate or Company Warrant who is not the
registered owner of a surrendered Company Certificate or Company Warrant
unless (i) the Company Certificate or Company Warrant so surrendered has been
properly endorsed or otherwise is in proper form for transfer, and (ii) such
person shall either (A) pay any transfer or other tax required by reason of
such issuance or (B) establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.3_,
from and after the Effective Time, each Company Certificate and each Company
Warrant shall be deemed to represent, for all purposes, the right to receive
the Share Price or the Warrant Price, as applicable, with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Warrants formerly represented
thereby. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Certificate_ " means a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Company Common Stock and " _Holder_ " means a person who holds (i) one or
more Company Certificates, (ii) one or more Company Warrants or (iii) Company
Options as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
hereto agree that payments to holders of Company Options may be made in such
other manner as Parent and the Shareholder Representative may mutually
agree. 

    

 (d) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.3_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Warrants exchanged for cash theretofore represented by such Certificates, and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Warrants which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any other party hereto shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, in the event that a Holder requests to receive payment of the portion of the Merger Consideration payable to such Holder pursuant to _Section 2.1_, directly as of the Closing Date, Company and Parent shall cooperate with such Holder to permit such Holder to receive payment in such manner;  _provided_ , that such Holder has executed and delivered a Joinder Agreement and executes and delivers at least five (5) business days prior to the Closing the documents such 

   ##### 

  

 

Holder would otherwise have been required to deliver if such Holder were to
receive payment from the Paying Agent. Any payment in excess of $1,000,000 to
be made pursuant to this _Section 2.3(f)_ shall, at the request of the
Holder, be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
provided to Parent by such Holder at least five (5) business days prior to the
Closing. Any amounts paid directly to Holders pursuant to this _Section
2.3(f)_ shall be deducted from the amount of the Merger Consideration to be
deposited with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 2.4 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue and pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Pro Rata Share of the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Company Certificates; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates to agree to indemnify Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 2.5 _Dissenter s Rights_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a stockholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has delivered a written demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, if such Section 262 provides for appraisal rights for such Company Common Stock in the Merger (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Share Price, as provided in _Section 2.1_ hereof, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Share Price to which such holder is entitled, without interest or dividends thereon. 

  

 (b) Company shall give Parent and the Shareholder Representative prompt notice of any demands received by Company for appraisal of Company Common Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, and Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. 

  

 (c) Company shall promptly but not later than ten (10) business days following the date of this Agreement mail to each stockholder of the Company that had not voted or executed a written consent approving this Agreement a notice (the " _Dissenting Share Notice_ ") stating that this Agreement has been approved by stockholders of the Company holding the requisite number of shares of Company Common Stock and that appraisal rights are available for holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Such notice 

   ##### 

  

 

shall also include a copy of such Section 262. Company shall provide a draft
copy of the Dissenting Share Notice to Parent at least three business days
prior to such mailing and shall incorporate all comments reasonably proposed
by Parent to such Dissenting Share Notice. Following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deliver such other notices
and to take such other actions as may be required in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL and to keep the Shareholder Representative reasonably
apprised thereof. 

   

 2.6 _Required Withholdings_. Company and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ ") or under any applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been delivered or otherwise paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been delivered or otherwise paid pursuant to the Merger and this Agreement. 

  

 2.7 _Escrow_. At Closing, Parent shall deposit in cash in United States dollars an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Initial Merger Consideration determined after taking into account the adjustment contemplated by _Section 1.7(b)_ (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") with an escrow agent reasonably satisfactory to Company and Parent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") for the purposes of securing the payment of (i) the indemnification obligations of the Company Equityholders pursuant to _Section 5.12_ and _Article IX_ and (ii) the obligations of the Company Equityholders pursuant the  _Section 1.8(a)_. The Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Amount shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any pledges, security interests, liens, charges, encumbrances, equities, claims and options of whatever nature (" _Lien_ "), attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Upon the termination of the Escrow Agreement, any portion of the Escrow Amount remaining shall be distributed in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement.

 3.1 _Organization, Etc_. 

  

 (a) Each of Company and the Company Subsidiaries (as defined below) is a corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business, and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept), in each jurisdiction where the character of its owned or leased properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had, or could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. " _Company Subsidiaries_ " means each entity in which Company has an equity investment, whether or not such investment is directly or indirectly owned, whether or not such entity is wholly owned, majority owned or less than majority owned and whether or not such entity is a "subsidiary" of Company under GAAP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term Company Subsidiary does not include Doctors Surgery Center of Kingman, LLC; Four States Surgery Center, LLC; and Eastgate Building Center, LLC.  _Schedule 3.1(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Statement lists each entity in which the Company has an equity interest, directly or indirectly, the jurisdiction of its organization, and specifically identifies each Company Subsidiary whose financial results are, in accordance with GAAP, reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Company (" _Consolidated Company Subsidiaries_ "). 

  

 For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change, effect or circumstance that either individually or in the aggregate with all other changes, effects or circumstances (i) is, has been or is reasonably expected to be materially adverse to the business, financial condition, results of operations, or assets and liabilities, taken as a whole, of Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or (ii) would reasonably be expected to prevent Company from consummating the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement or to perform any of its obligations under the Agreement before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to item (i) above, none of the following shall be deemed (either alone or in combination) to constitute, and none of the following shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (A) any adverse change, event or effect arising from or relating to general business or economic conditions which does not disproportionately affect Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other industry participants impacted thereby; (B) any adverse change, event or effect relating to or affecting the healthcare industry generally, which does not disproportionately affect Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other industry participants impacted thereby; and (C) any adverse change, event or effect arising from or relating to the announcement or pendency of the Merger. 

  

 (b) Neither Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is in material violation of any provision of its certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws or, in the case of any Company Subsidiary that is not a corporation, any equivalent organizational document. _Schedule 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Statement sets forth (i) the full name of each entity in which Company has an equity interest, directly or indirectly, the ownership interest of Company in such entity and (ii) each jurisdiction in which Company and each of the Company

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly and validly authorized by the vote of the Board and will be submitted to the stockholders of Company for approval, at a duly called meeting of the stockholders of Company or, in lieu of a meeting, by an action by written consent of the stockholders of Company, owning at least a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Company, or actions on the part of any Company Equityholder, are or will be necessary to authorize this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Company, enforceable against Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general equitable principles. 

  

 3.3 _No Violations, Etc_.

   ##### 

  

 

bound, or (iii) result in a material violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, or
result in any material change in, or give rise to any right of payment,
termination, cancellation, acceleration, redemption or repurchase under, any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material Company Contract
(as defined in _Section 3.12_). _Schedule 3.3_ of the Company Disclosure
Statement lists all consents, notices, waivers and approvals required to be
obtained in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby under (i) any Company Contracts, or (ii) except for those whose
failure to obtain will not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, any
of Companys or any Company Subsidiaries other notes, bonds, mortgages,
indentures, deeds of trust, licenses or leases, contracts, agreements or
other instruments or obligations. 

   

 3.4 _Capitalization_.

Each of the Company Options is either currently exercisable or will become exercisable at or prior to the Effective Time.

   ##### 

  

  

 (j) No liability under any Pension Benefit Plan or Welfare Plan has been funded or self-insured nor has any such obligation been satisfied with the purchase of a contract from an insurance company as to which Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has received notice that such insurance company is in rehabilitation or a comparable proceeding. 

  

 (k) Neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor any termination of employment or any other service relationship, will result in an increase in the amount of compensation or benefits or accelerate the vesting or timing of payment of any benefits or compensation payable to or in respect of any current or former employee, director or consultant of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by Company, any Company Subsidiary or other Company ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any Company Employee Benefit Plan which would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Company Employee Benefit Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to such Company Employee Benefit Plan for the most recent fiscal year included in the Company Financial Statements.

Company will keep Parent informed as promptly as practicable in all material respects of the status and details (including material amendments or proposed material amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry made after the date hereof. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, immediately following any determination of the Board to authorize Company to enter into any Alternative Definitive Agreement, and in all cases not less than five (5) business days prior to Companys entering into such Alternative Definitive Agreement or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_, Company shall give Parent written notice of its intent to take such action. Any such notice shall include the identity of the person or group making the Alternative Proposal and the final terms and conditions thereof (including a copy of the proposed Alternative Definitive Agreement and all related agreements, exhibits and schedules). For a period of five (5) business days following the receipt of such notice, Company shall in good faith afford Parent the opportunity to offer to revise the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements such that the Alternative Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Offer (any such offer made by Parent, a " _Matching Proposal_ "). Company shall not be permitted to enter into any such Alternative Definitive Agreement or terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(f)_ if a Matching Proposal is made during such five (5) business day period (it being understood that any amendment or modification to the terms of an Alternative Proposal in response to a Matching Proposal shall require the delivery of a new notice to Parent and a new five (5) business day matching period). In the event that Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ and enter into a Definitive Alternative Agreement, Company shall deliver a copy of such Definitive Alternative Agreement and all related agreements, exhibits and schedules to Parent immediately after its execution by Company. 

  

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " with respect to Company shall mean any offer or proposal (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) relating to any Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall mean any transaction or series of related transactions involving: (A) any purchase from Company or acquisition by any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Company or of any Company Subsidiary (other than an the sale of equity interests in Company Subsidiaries effected in the ordinary course of business) or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of Company or of any Company Subsidiary or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving Company; (B) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or disposition of more than 15% 

   ##### 

  

 

of the consolidated assets of Company; or (C) any liquidation or dissolution
of Company. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Offer_ " shall mean
an Acquisition Proposal relating to all or substantially all of the assets or
at least 100% equity securities of Company which the board of directors of
Company determines in good faith, taking into account all legal, financial
and regulatory aspects of the Acquisition Proposal, the likelihood of
obtaining financing and the identity of the Potential Acquiror, is more
favorable from a financial point of view to Companys stockholders than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 5.3 _Access to Information_. 

   

 (a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, Company will afford to Parent, its prospective financing sources and its and their respective authorized Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to all of its facilities, personnel and operations and to all of its and the Company Subsidiaries books and records, will permit Parent and its authorized Representatives to conduct inspections as they may reasonably request and will instruct its officers and those of the Company Subsidiaries to furnish Parent with such financial and operating data and other information with respect to its business and properties as Parent may from time to time reasonably request, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of October 4, 2005 between Parent and Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Parent agrees that it will treat any such information in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (b) During the sixteen (16) day following the date of this Agreement, Company shall use its reasonable efforts (i) to schedule meetings between Parent, its Representatives and such Company Representatives as are reasonably requested by Parent, with the members of the board of directors (or other similar governing board) of such Company Subsidiaries as Parent may request and with the physicians who own equity interests in the Company Subsidiaries (" _Physician Meetings_ ") and (ii) to cause such Company Representatives, member of the boards of directors and physicians to attend such Physician Meetings. Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to be available for and to attend the Physician Meetings when scheduled. Parent and Company will cooperate to arrange such Physician Meetings to occur at mutually convenient times and at locations of the physicians choosing. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Closing, Company shall and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the Company Subsidiaries and their respective officers and employees to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of any bank 

   ##### 

  

 

financing to be consummated contemporaneously with or at or after the Closing
in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
participation in meetings and due diligence sessions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent acknowledges and agrees that (i) none of the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries or their respective officers or employees will give,
or be deemed to have given, any representation or warranty, or provided any
other assurance, to any person, nor owe or accept any duty or responsibility
to any person, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, nor shall any of
them be liable in respect of any Loss (as defined below) arising out of or
in connection with such bank financing, including, in connection with
persons reliance upon any information delivered in connection with such bank
financing and (ii) the only representations or warranties made by Company in
relation to Company and the Company Subsidiaries are those expressly set
forth in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and solely on the terms

 5.4 _Reasonable Efforts_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, Parent, Merger Sub and Company shall use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or appropriate under this Agreement, applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) using reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary governmental and private party consents, approvals or waivers, (ii) using reasonable efforts to lift any legal bar to the Merger, and (iii) furnishing all information required under the HSR Act.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (other than _Section 5.14_), neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation, nor Company nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) divest, hold separate or license (through a trust or otherwise) any business(es), product line(s) or asset(s), (ii) take any action or accept any limitation that would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) agree to any of the foregoing. Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to make all filings required to be made under the HSR Act within ten (10) days following the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Company agrees to provide, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and employees to provide all necessary cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing. 

  

 5.5 _Public Announcements_. Before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and Company agree to consult with each other as to its form and substance, and agree not to issue any such press release or general communication to employees or make any public statement prior to obtaining the consent of the other (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except to the extent that Parent, Merger Sub or Company, as the case may be, is advised by outside counsel that such public statement may be required by applicable law (in which case the disclosing party will provide the other parties with the opportunity to review in advance the disclosure) or by the rules and regulations of or listing agreement with Nasdaq Stock Market, or as may otherwise be required by the Nasdaq Stock Market or the SEC; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this _Section 5.5_ will not prohibit

relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. 

   

 (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty of Company (or, to the knowledge of Company, any Company Equityholder contained in this Agreement, the Support Agreement or any Joinder Agreement) to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Effective Time (together with amendments or supplements to the Company Disclosure Statement that are necessary to correct such inaccuracy), (ii) any material failure of Company or, to the knowledge of Company, any Company Equityholder, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder or thereunder, (iii) any notice or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) any facts or circumstances arise that could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 (d) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, (i) Parent agrees to notify promptly Company if Parent becomes aware of any circumstances or conditions that have caused, or would be reasonably expected to cause, any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by Company in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and (ii) Company agrees to notify promptly Parent if Company becomes aware of any circumstances or conditions that have caused, or would be reasonably expected to cause, any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by Parent in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 5.7 _Indemnification Rights_. 

   

 (a) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are, to the extent permitted by the DGCL, at least as favorable as those contained in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at the Effective Time were directors, officers, employees or agents of Company unless such modification is required by law. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Closing, Company shall purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy covering those persons who are currently covered by Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (the " _Current Policy_ ") (a copy of which has been made available to Parent).

 5.8 _Resignation of Directors and Officers_. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall use its reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent the resignations of such directors and officers of Company and Company Subsidiaries (which directors and officers are also employees of Company or Surgis Management, Inc.) as Parent shall specify at least ten business days prior to the Closing, effective at the Effective Time. For avoidance of doubt, no resignation tendered pursuant to this  _Section 5.8_ shall be considered a resignation or termination of employment by such person. 

   

 5.9 _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

   

 (a) For a period of one year immediately following the Closing Date, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or another Parent Subsidiary (as defined below) shall provide each employee of Company and each employee of Surgis Management, Inc. as of immediately prior to the Closing Date who is employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or another subsidiary of Parent following the Closing Date (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with employee benefits (including retirement programs and health and welfare benefits but excluding incentive programs and equity compensation arrangements) that are, in the aggregate, at least substantially equivalent to those provided to such Continuing Employees as of the date hereof; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit modifications to any employee benefit plans or arrangements in the ordinary course of business or to the extent required by applicable law. " _Parent Subsidiaries_ " means each entity in which Parent has an equity investment, whether or not such investment is directly or indirectly owned, whether or not such entity is wholly owned, majority owned or less than majority owned and whether or not such entity is a "subsidiary" of Parent under GAAP (including, following the Closing, Company and the Company Subsidiaries). 

  

 (b) Subject to _Section 5.9(a)_, Parent agrees to cause all Continuing Employees to be eligible to participate in Parents 2001 Equity-Based Compensation Plan, Parents Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Parents health and life insurance plans, in each case, consistent with the eligibility criteria applied by Parent to other employees of Parent and the 

   ##### 

  

 

Parent Subsidiaries. The Continuing Employees shall receive full credit for
prior years of service with Company and the Company Subsidiaries on parity
with Parent employees with respect to eligibility to participate in all
Parent employee benefit plans, programs and policies made available to
employees of Parent generally, in each case, to the extent permitted by law
and the terms of such plans. 

   

 (c) From and after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will honor in accordance with their terms all existing severance, employment or other similar agreements between Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any current or former officer, director, employee or consultant of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that have been disclosed on the Company Disclosure Statement. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the preceding, nothing in this _Section 5.9_ or this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any right or claim to continue in the employ of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any Parent Subsidiary or other affiliate of Parent or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any Parent Subsidiary or other affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to remove, terminate or discharge any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason or no reason. 

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.9_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any dependent thereof) of Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation of any nature or kind whatsoever. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, compensation provided to Continuing Employees shall be determined by Parent in its sole discretion. 

  

 5.10 _Board Recommendation_. Subject to its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Board shall recommend that the stockholders of Company adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the transactions contemplated herein.

 (a) The Company Equityholders, Company, the Shareholders Representatives and Parent will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection with any Tax matters relating to Company (including by the provision of reasonably relevant records or information). The party requesting such cooperation will pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the other parties. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements and all powers of attorney with respect to or involving Company shall be terminated prior to the Closing. 

  

 (c) The Company Equityholders and Parent shall bear equally all transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent, or the Company Equityholders as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the other at the Closing any certificates or other documents as may reasonably be requested to perfect any exemption from any such transfer Tax or otherwise comply with applicable reporting requirements with respect to such transfer Taxes. 

  

 (d) The Company Equityholders shall pay (i) all Taxes of Company for all Taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which Company is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign tax law or regulation and (iii) any and all Taxes of any person imposed on Company for any period as a transferee or successor in respect of a transaction occurring on or before the Closing Date, by law, contract, or otherwise;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Company Equityholders shall be liable for Taxes pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes in computing Closing Working Capital and (B) the Company Equityholders shall not be held liable for any Taxes attributable to actions not in the ordinary course of business and not contemplated by this Agreement taken by Parent or Company after the Closing. 

  

 (e) In the case of any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes of Company based upon or measured by net income or gain which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which Company holds a beneficial interest will be deemed to terminate at such time. The amount of Taxes of Company other than transfer Taxes and Taxes that are based upon or measured by net income or gain for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. 

  

 (f) The Shareholders Representatives shall prepare and duly and timely file (i) all Tax Returns of Company that are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date, (ii) all Tax Returns of Company that are required to be filed after the Closing Date for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, and (iii) all Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to Transfer Taxes (collectively, " _Shareholder Returns_ "). All Shareholder Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the most recent Tax Returns of Company except to the extent that either the Shareholder Representative determines that there is no reasonable basis for a position taken on any such recent Tax Return or Parent consents to the Companys taking a different position, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing of a Shareholder Return, the 

   ##### 

  

 

Shareholders Representatives shall provide Parent with a copy of such
Shareholder Return. The Shareholders Representatives shall make such changes
to the Shareholder Return as Parent may reasonably request, and shall not
file such Shareholder Return without Parents consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Parent shall prepare and file
all Tax Returns other than Shareholder Returns; _provided_ , _ however_ ,
that not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing of a
Straddle Period Tax Return, and not later than thirty (30) days prior to
filing any amended Tax Return related to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, Parent
shall provide the Shareholders Representatives with a copy of such Tax
Return, shall make such changes to the portions of the Tax Return that relate
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period as the Shareholders Representatives may
reasonably request, and shall not file such Tax Return without the
Shareholders Representatives consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed. In the case of a Straddle Period Tax
Return, the Company Equityholders shall pay to Parent the Company
Equityholders share of any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Return
(determined pursuant to clauses (d) and (e) above) not later than seven (7)
days prior to the date for filing such Tax Return. 

   

 (g) Company shall promptly remit to the Shareholders Representatives for distribution to the Company Equityholders any refund of Taxes of Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, except to the extent that (i) such refund was reflected as an asset on the Closing Working Capital Statement, (ii) such refund is attributable to actions not in the ordinary course of business taken by Parent or Company on the Closing Date and after the Closing, or (iii) such refund is attributable to the carryback of a Tax attribute (including a net operating loss, net capital loss, foreign tax credit, or research and development credit) arising in a period other than a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ "), and the carryback of such Tax attribute does not reduce the amount of any refund that would otherwise be received by the Company Equityholders. Any refund of Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing and Post-Closing Tax Periods in accordance with clause (e) of this _Section 5.12_ (Straddle Periods). All other refunds of Taxes of Company shall be for the account of Company. 

  

 (h) If the Company Equityholders pay a Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period as a result of an adjustment by a Governmental Entity of a Tax Return for such periods, and Company actually realizes a Tax benefit (including a refund, credit, or reduction in Tax) in a period other than a Pre-Closing Tax Period as a result of such adjustment, Company shall pay the amount of such Tax benefit to the Shareholders Representatives for distribution to the Company Equityholders within thirty (30) days after the filing of a Tax Return reflecting such Tax benefit (subject to the Company Equityholders entering into an indemnity arrangement reasonably satisfactory to Parent and providing for the return of such payment if such Tax benefit is ultimately disallowed). 

  

 (i) Resolution of Tax Disputes. 

   

 (i) If Parent receives notice of a claim by a Governmental Entity in respect of Taxes of Company for a Pre-Closing Period which may give rise to a liability of Company Equityholders under this Agreement (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Claim_ "), then Parent will promptly give written notice to the Shareholders Representatives;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on 

   ##### 

  

    

the part of Parent in notifying the Shareholders Representatives will relieve
the Company Equityholders from any obligation under this Section 5.12, except
to the extent such delay actually and materially prejudices the Company
Equityholders. 

   

 (ii) The Shareholders Representatives will be entitled to participate at their own cost and expense in the defense of any Pre-Closing Tax Claim that is the subject of a notice given by Parent pursuant to clause (i) above. In addition, the Shareholders Representatives will have the right to defend Company against the Pre-Closing Tax Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to Parent so long as (A) the Shareholders Representatives give written notice to Parent within fifteen days after Parent has given notice of the Pre-Closing Tax Claim that the Company Equityholders will indemnify Parent from and against the entirety of any and all Losses Parent may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Pre-Closing Tax Claim (including any Taxes arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period as the result of the resolution of such Pre-Closing Tax Claim), (B) the Shareholders Representatives provide Parent with evidence reasonably acceptable to Parent that the Company Equityholders will have adequate financial resources to defend against the Pre-Closing Tax Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, and (C) the Shareholders Representatives conduct the defense of the Pre-Closing Tax Claim actively and diligently;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Equityholders will pay the fees and expenses of separate co-counsel retained by Parent that are incurred prior to the Shareholder Representatives assumption of control of the defense of the Pre-Closing Tax Claim. 

   

 (iii) The Shareholders Representatives will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld, or delayed. 

   

 (iv) If the Shareholders Representatives do not deliver the notice contemplated by clause (i)(i) of this _Section 5.12_, or the evidence contemplated by clause (i)(ii), within fifteen (15) days after Parent has given notice of the Pre-Closing Tax Claim, or otherwise at any time fails to conduct the defense of the Pre-Closing Tax Claim actively and diligently, Parent may defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to, the Pre-Closing Tax Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and Parent need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Shareholders Representatives in connection therewith). If such notice and evidence is given on a timely basis and the Shareholders Representatives conduct the defense of the Pre-Closing Tax Claim actively and diligently but any of the other conditions in clause (ii) of this  _Section 5.12_ is or becomes unsatisfied, Parent may defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to, the Pre-Closing Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Equityholders will not be bound by the entry of any such judgment not consented to, or any such compromise or 

    ##### 

 

     

settlement effected, without its prior written consent (which consent will not
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld, or delayed). If that Parent conducts
the defense of the Pre-Closing Tax Claim pursuant to this _Section
5.12(i)(iv)_, the Company Equityholders shall (x) advance Parent promptly and
periodically the costs of defending against the Pre-Closing Tax Claim
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) and (y) remain
responsible for any and all other Losses that Parent may incur or suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused by
the Pre-Closing Tax Claim. 

  

 5.13 _Audited Financial Statements_. Promptly, after execution of this Agreement, Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause to be prepared an audited consolidated balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flow (including, in each case, any related notes thereto) of Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 (the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "). Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Audited Financial Statements to be prepared as promptly as practicable. To the extent paid prior on or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall reimburse Company for all amounts in excess of $200,000 (the " _Additional Audit Expenses_ ") paid in respect of the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements.

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party
whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in
the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date and such action or
failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the failure to consummate the Merger by the
Outside Date is due to a delay in obtaining approval for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act, if required, the
Outside Date shall be the earlier of (a) June 1, 2006 or (b) five (5) business
days after approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

 (c) by either Company or Parent if (i) a statute, rule, regulation or executive order shall have been enacted, entered or promulgated prohibiting the consummation of the Merger substantially on the terms contemplated hereby or (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction or other Government Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger; 

  

 (d) by Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ or  _Section 7.1(b)_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, _provided_ that such inaccuracy in Parents representations and warranties or breach by Parent remains uncured on the date which is twenty (20) business days following written notice of such breach or inaccuracy from Company to Parent (it being understood that Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(d)_ if it shall have materially breached this Agreement and remains in breach of this Agreement as of the date of such termination);

 8.2 _Notice of Termination_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ will be effective immediately upon the delivery of a valid written notice of the terminating party to the other parties hereto.

 9.1 _Grant of Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) The Company Equityholders, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.3_, shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent and each of its affiliates (including, following the Closing, Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries), and the Representatives of each of the foregoing persons (each, a " _Parent Indemnified Person_ ") from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, obligations, lawsuits, Actions, investigations, governmental orders, deficiencies, liens, encumbrances, damages, costs and expenses of whatever nature, accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, including interest, penalties, fines, reasonable attorneys fees and other costs of investigation, defense and enforcement and all amounts paid in settlement whether or not involving a third party claim (" _Losses_ ") that are suffered or incurred by such Parent Indemnified Persons as a result of, arising out of or directly or indirectly relating to: 

   

 (i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by Company in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or in any document, schedule, instrument or certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (in each case, as such representation or warranty would read if all qualifications as to materiality, substantial compliance and "Company Material Adverse Effect" were deleted therefrom, except for the reference to "Company Material Adverse Effect in the first clause of _Section 3.8_ and for _Section 3.19_) ; 

   

 (ii) any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of Company to the extent required to be performed or complied with by 

   ##### 

  

   

Company prior to the Closing in or pursuant to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement; 

   

 (iii) amounts payable by the Company in respect of Dissenting Shares in excess of the Share Price; and 

   

 (iv) any claim, action, suit or proceeding (including any appraisal proceeding brought under Section 262 of the DGCL) brought by any actual or alleged current or former stockholder, optionholder or warrantholder of Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Each Company Equityholder shall severally (and solely with respect to itself) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Losses that are suffered or incurred by such Parent Indemnified Persons as a result of, arising out of or directly or indirectly relating to: 

   

 (i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by such Company Equityholder in this Agreement, the Joinder Agreement, the Support Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement or in any document, schedule, instrument or certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, the Joinder Agreement, the Support Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement; and 

   

 (ii) any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of such Company Equityholder in or pursuant to this Agreement, the Joinder Agreement, the Support Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement. 

  

 (c) Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold Company and, following the Closing, the Company Equityholders, and their respective affiliates and the Representatives of each of the foregoing persons (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Person_ ") from and against any Losses suffered or incurred by any such Seller Indemnified Person as a result of, arising out of or directly or indirectly relating to:

 (ii) any breach or violation of any convenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub to the extent required to be performed or complied with by Company Merger Sub prior to the Closing in or pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. 

   

 9.2 _Representation, Cooperation; Settlement etc.._  

   

 (a) Each party agrees to give prompt notice to the other(s) of any claim which might give rise to a claim based on the indemnity contained in this _Article_ , stating 

   ##### 

  

 

the nature and basis of the claim and the amount thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying
the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
obligation under this _Article IX_, except to the extent such delay actually
and materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (b) In the event any claim, action, suit or proceeding is brought against a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to which another party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may have liability under this _Article_ , the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company Equityholders) to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting from such claim, _provided,_ that (x) Parent shall not be required to permit the Shareholder Representative to assume the defense of any third party claim which if not paid, discharged or otherwise complies with would result in interruption or cessation of the conduct of Companys or the Company Subsidiaries business and (y) the Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company Equityholders) will have the right to defend the Indemnified Party against the claim only so long as (i) the claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnified Party has not been advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company Equityholders) in connection with the defense of the claim, (iii) the claim does not relate to or otherwise arise in connection with Taxes or any criminal or regulatory enforcement matter, and (iv) the Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company Equityholders) conducts the defense of the claim actively and diligently. Failure of the Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company Equityholders) to notify the Indemnified Party of its election to defend any such claim or action by a third party within 20 days after notice thereof shall have been given by the Indemnified Party, shall be deemed a waiver of any such election. If the Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company Equityholders) assumes the defense of such claim or litigation resulting therefrom, the obligations of the Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company Equityholders) hereunder as to such claim shall include taking all steps reasonably necessary in the defense or settlement of such claim or litigation resulting therefrom, including the retention of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and holding the Indemnified Party harmless from and against any and all damage resulting from, arising out of, or incurred with respect to any settlement approved by the Indemnifying Party or any judgment in connection with such claim or litigation resulting therefrom. The Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company Equityholders) shall not, in the defense of such claim or litigation, consent to the entry of any judgment (other than a judgment of dismissal on the merits with costs) except with the written consent of the Indemnified Party nor enter into any settlement (except with the written consent of the Indemnified Party) which does not include as an unconditional terms thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. 

  

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company Equityholders) shall not assume the defense of any such claim by a third party or litigation resulting therefrom, and until the defense thereof is assumed the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim or litigation in such manner as it deems appropriate. The Indemnifying Party shall, in accordance with the provisions hereof, promptly reimburse the 

   ##### 

  

 

Indemnified Party for the amount of any settlement reasonably entered into by
the Indemnified Party and for all damage incurred, costs and expenses by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense against or settlement of
such claim or litigation. Prior to any Indemnifying Party (or the
Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company Equityholders) assuming
the defense of any claim pursuant to this _Section 9.2_, such Indemnifying
Party (or the Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company
Equityholders) must first have agreed in writing to the satisfaction of
the Indemnified Party, that the claim to be defended against is subject to
Indemnification under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Indemnifying Party (or
the Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company Equityholders) may
not assume the defense of any third party claim due to any of the factors set
forth in the proviso of the first sentence of _Section 9.2(a)_, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be bound by any determination of any proceeding
relating to such claim or any compromise of settlement effected with respect
to such claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (or
the Shareholder Representative in the case of the Company Equityholders)
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 9.3 _Limitations of Liability_. 

   

 (a) The maximum liability of each Company Equityholder executing the Joinder Agreements for any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ shall not exceed the amount of such Company Equityholders Indemnification Share (as defined below) of ten percent (10%) of the Initial Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation set forth in this _Section 9.3(a)_ shall not apply to any claim for indemnification based on a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty contained in any of _Sections 3.1(a), 3.2, 3.3(a), 3.3(b)(i) and (ii), 3.4, 3.10(a) (last sentence), 3.15 or 3.23_. For purposes of this Agreement the " _Indemnification Share_ " of a Company Equityholder executing a Joinder Agreement means a fraction the numerator of which is such Company Equityholders Pro Rata Share of the Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the aggregate Pro Rata Shares of the Merger Consideration attributable to all Company Equityholders executing Joinder Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that any claims for indemnification by Parent Indemnified Persons under this Agreement shall, to the extent possible, first be made against the Escrow Fund, and that any payments therefrom to the Parent Indemnified Persons would be effective a payment by each Company Equityholder in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. 

  

 (b) No Company Equityholder shall have any obligation to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to the provisions of _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate of all Losses suffered or incurred by Parent which would otherwise be subject to indemnification hereunder exceeds $2,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that all Losses suffered or incurred by Parent for Pre-Closing Tax Claims and the breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty contained in any of _Sections 3.1(a), 3.2, 3.3(a), 3.3(b)(i) and (ii), 3.4, 3.10(a) (last sentence), 3.15, 3.19 or 3.23_ shall not be subject to the Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Company Equityholder shall have any obligation to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to the provisions of _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ with respect to any claim or series of related claims unless and until the aggregate of all Losses suffered or incurred in connection with such claim or series of related claims exceeds $50,000 

   ##### 

  

 

(it being understood that all such Losses shall be subject to indemnification
if such $50,000 threshold is exceeded). 

   

 (c) In no event shall an individual Company Equityholder be jointly and severally liable for the fraud or breach of another Company Equityholder under the Support Agreement or Joinder Agreements. 

  

 9.4 _Remedies Exclusive_. Except with respect to claims of fraud and except as provided in  _Article VIII_ and _Section 10.7_, from and after the Closing, the remedies provided in this _Article IX_ shall be the exclusive remedies available the Indemnified Parties hereunder for the Losses suffered or incurred by an Indemnified Party pursuant to the this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedies provided for in this _Article IX_ (and _Article VIII_ and _Section 10.7_) are fair and equitable and hereby waive any other remedies that might otherwise be available to them whether under law or at equity. 

   

 9.5 _No Circular Recovery; Other Matters_. 

   

 (a) Each Company Equityholder hereby agrees that it will not make any claim for indemnification against Parent, Company or any Company Subsidiary by reason of the fact that such Company Equityholder was a controlling person, director, employee or other Representative of Company or any Company Subsidiary or was serving as such for another person at the request of Company or any Company Subsidiary (whether such claim is for Losses of any kind or otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant to any statute, charter, bylaw or other organizational document, contractual obligation or otherwise) with respect to any claim brought by a Parent Indemnified Person against such Company Equityholder under this _Article IX_ or otherwise relating to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. With respect to any claim brought by a Parent Indemnified Person against any Company Equityholder relating to the Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, each Company Equityholder expressly waives any right of subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or other claim against Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any amounts owed by such Company Equityholder pursuant to this  _Article IX_. 

  

 (b) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article IX_, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party or its affiliates may have against any other persons not a party to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter underlying such claim and the Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to take, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, such actions as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request to perfect such subrogation. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that any fact, event or circumstance which results in an adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Sections 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 5.14 or 5.15_ would also constitute a breach or inaccuracy of any of Companys representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement, the Company Equityholders shall have no obligation to indemnify any 

   ##### 

  

 

Parent Indemnified Persons with respect to such breach of inaccuracy to the
extent that recovery for any such Loss would constitute a duplicative payment
of amounts recovered as a purchase price adjustment pursuant to pursuant to 
_Sections 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 5.14 or 5.15_. 

   

 (d) All indemnification payments paid pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for tax purposes. 

  

 9.6 _Recovery Not Affected By Knowledge_. The right of any Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ will not be affected by any investigation conducted or knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement. 

   

ARTICLE X

Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by written agreement of Parent, Merger Sub and Company at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such amendment or modification shall, without obtaining approval of the holders of Company Common Stock as required by law, (a) change the amount or form of the consideration to be received by Companys stockholders in the Merger in exchange for the Company Common Stock, or (b) change any other term or condition of the Merger if such change would materially and adversely affect Company or the holders of any Company Common Stock.
