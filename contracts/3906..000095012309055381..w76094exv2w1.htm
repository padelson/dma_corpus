 1.6 _Stock Options._

   

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Companys Board of Directors shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary and sufficient to cause all outstanding unvested and unexercisable options to purchase shares of the Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plan (each outstanding option to purchase shares of the Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plan, whether or not vested and exercisable, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") to be fully vested and exercisable. In addition, at least three Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide the Company Stock Option holders the opportunity to provide the Company with a notice to exercise some or all of the outstanding Company Stock Options held by them, such exercise to be effective as of the Effective Time; provided that the resolutions and actions of the Companys Board of Directors to cause all unvested and unexercisable Company Stock Options to be fully vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time, and the exercise of such Company Stock Options by the holders thereof, shall be contingent on the Effective Time occurring. The Company Common Stock acquired upon such exercise shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary to issue, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than five Business Days) after the Effective Time, shares of the Parent Common Stock in respect thereof to the holders of the Company Stock Options exercised, in accordance with their terms, pursuant to this _Section 1.6(a)_.

 (i) equal to or greater than the product of (a) the Parent Average Closing Price and (b) the Exchange Ratio, shall be cancelled without any payment therefor and

   

 (ii) less than the product of (a) the Parent Average Closing Price and (b) the Exchange Ratio, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, at the election of the holder, either

   

 (A) a lump sum cash amount, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than ten Business Days) after the Effective Time, equal to the product of (u) x (w), where (u) is the excess of the Parent Average Closing Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio over the exercise price per share under such Company Stock Option and (w) is the total number of shares of the Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option for which this election is made, less applicable withholdings, or

   ##### 

  

   

 (B) a number of shares of the Parent Common Stock equal to (i) the product of (x) the total number of shares of the Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option for which this election is made times (y) the excess of (1) the Parent Average Closing Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio over (2) the exercise price per share under such Company Stock Option, less applicable withholdings, divided by (ii) the Parent Average Closing Price;  _provided_ , that each holder of Company Stock Options who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of the Parent Common Stock (with all calculations rounded to three decimal places) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of the Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the Parent Average Closing Price. 

   

At least three Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
provide the Company Stock Option holders the opportunity to make the election
provided by this  _Section 1.6(b)_ with respect to some or all of the
outstanding Company Stock Options held by them, such election to be effective
as of the Effective Time; _provided_ that the resolutions and actions of the
Companys Board of Directors authorizing the election provided by this
_Section 1.6(b)_ and a holders election pursuant to this _Section 1.6(b)_
shall be contingent on the Effective Time occurring; _provided_ ,  _further_
, that if any Company Stock Option holder fails to make an election
pursuant to this _Section 1.6(b)_, such holder shall be deemed to have made
an election to receive shares of the Parent Common Stock pursuant to this
_Section 1.6(b)(ii)(B)_. Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions reasonably necessary to issue to the holders of the Company Stock
Options who have made an election to receive shares of the Parent Common
Stock pursuant to this _Section 1.6(b)(ii)(B)_, shares of the Parent Common
Stock to the extent of such holders election as soon as reasonably
practicable (but in no event later than five Business Days) after the
Effective Time. 

   

 (c) For purposes of this _Section 1.6_, " _Parent Average Closing Price_ " means the average closing price per share of the Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported thereby, by another authoritative source mutually agreed by the parties) for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Companys Board of Directors shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary and sufficient to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 1.6(d)_ and to cause the Company Stock Option Plan to be terminated as of the Effective Time.

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION  

  

 2.1 _Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Parents transfer agent to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") hereunder, pursuant to an agreement (the "Exchange Agent Agreement"), the form of which shall be subject to the Companys prior approval (such prior approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

 2.2 _Deposit of Merger Consideration._ At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of the Company Common Stock, (a) certificates representing the Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to  _Section 1.5(c)_ (or otherwise shall make shares of the Parent Common Stock available for such issuance) minus the aggregate number of shares of the Parent Common Stock that is represented by the fractional shares for which the Exchange Agent shall pay an amount in cash to the holders thereof and (b) cash sufficient to pay the cash for fractional shares in accordance with  _Section 2.3(f)_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, additional cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_ and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_. Any cash and certificates of the Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (or shares of the Parent Common Stock otherwise made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.2_) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." 

  

 2.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration._  

   

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within five Business Days, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of 

   ##### 

 

  

such Certificates)) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such
form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by Parent and the
Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Parent
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.3(c)_.

  

 (b) Subject to _Section 2.3(f)_, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of the Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of the Company Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled to pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose other than the purposes provided for in the immediately preceding sentence. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and, subject to _Section 2.3(f)_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_, and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this  _Article II_.

  

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of the Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of the Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of the Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing the Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, the shares of the Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Parent Common Stock comprising the Merger Consideration, and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_, shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer. To the extent Parent reasonably determines that

   ##### 

 

  

any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or
issuance to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate are
required to be paid, the Person requesting such payment or issuance shall
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid
by such Person or is not applicable.

  

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of the Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of the Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. Subject to _Section 2.3(d)_, if, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and, subject to _Section 2.3(f)_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article II_, and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_.

  

 (f) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of the Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of the Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)_ , and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of the Parent Common Stock. Each holder of shares of the Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of the Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of the Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the Reference Price. For purposes of this _Section 2.3(f)_ , all fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places.

  

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may be paid to Parent, upon Parents written demand to the Exchange Agent. In such event, any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and other distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of the Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company, Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of the Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such

   ##### 

  

    

Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any
fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and other distributions on the
Parent Common Stock, in each case, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement. 

   

 (i) Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, to any holder of the Company Common Stock such amounts as it determines in good faith are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the recipient.

There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened or anticipated material Proceedings by, on behalf of or against any of the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries of such Company Benefit Plans (with respect to whom the Company has an indemnification obligation with respect to their duties to any such Company Benefit Plans), or against the assets of such Company Benefit Plans or any trust maintained in connection with such Company Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits). 

   

 (d) Each trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that together with the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries would be deemed to be a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "), has, to the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2008, fulfilled its obligations under the 

   ##### 

  

    

minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code with respect to each ERISA
Plan which it sponsors or maintains or to which it has an obligation to
contribute and is in material compliance with ERISA and the Code with respect
to each such ERISA Plan. To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1,
2008, no ERISA Affiliate has (i) sought a waiver of the minimum funding
standard under Section 412 of the Code in respect of any ERISA plan, (ii)
failed to make any contribution or payment to any ERISA Plan or Multiemployer
Plan, or made any amendment to any ERISA Plan, which has resulted or could
result in the imposition of a material Lien or the posting of a bond or other
security under ERISA or the Code, or (iii) incurred any material liability
under Title IV of ERISA, other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums
under Section 4007 of ERISA. To the knowledge of the Company, since January
1, 2008, no complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan has
been made by any ERISA Affiliate that would reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability to such ERISA Affiliate, whether such liability is
contingent or otherwise and if any ERISA Affiliate were to withdraw from any
such Multiemployer Plan, such withdrawal would not result in any material
liability to any ERISA Affiliate. For purposes of this Section 3.15(e), "
_ERISA Plan_ " means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 of 4971 of the Code, other than a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "
_Multiemployer Plan_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
representations contained in this Section 3.15(d) shall be deemed to be
breached only if and to the extent that the underlying event or occurrence
would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the
Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary. 

   

 (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries maintain or contribute to, or within the last six years have maintained or contributed to, (i) any "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Sections 4063/4064 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code. 

   

 (f) Except as Previously Disclosed, no Company Benefit Plan is under audit or is the subject of a material Proceeding by the IRS, the Department of Labor, the SEC or any other Governmental Entity, nor is any such audit or material Proceeding pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened. 

   

 (g) Except as Previously Disclosed, or as provided for by the terms of this Agreement, neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director, employee or individual treated as an independent contractor of the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries, (ii) materially increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee or individual treated as an independent contractor, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation, (iv) result in any amount failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or (v) result in any 

   ##### 

  

    

limitation (x) on the right of the Company or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, or (y) the right of Parent or any
of its Consolidated Subsidiaries on and after the Effective Time to amend,
merge or terminate any Company Benefit Plan maintained by the Company or its
Consolidated Subsidiaries or related trust. 

   

 (h) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither the Company nor its Consolidated Subsidiaries has any liability with respect to an obligation to provide post-employment group health benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to any Person beyond such Persons retirement or other termination of service, other than coverage mandated by Section 4980B of the Code or applicable Law. 

   

 (i) All the Company equity awards have been granted in material compliance with the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plans and applicable Law. 

   

 (j) Neither the Company nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement or other Contract with a labor union and there are no organizational campaigns, petitions or other activities or Proceedings of any labor union, workers council or labor organization seeking recognition of a collective bargaining unit with respect to, or otherwise attempting to represent, any of the employees of the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries or compel the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries to bargain with any such labor union, works council or labor organization. There are no labor related controversies, strikes, slowdowns, walkouts or other work stoppages pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened and neither the Company nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has experienced any such labor related controversy, strike, slowdown, walkout or other work stoppage within the past three years. Neither the Company nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any Governmental Entity relating to employees or employment practices. The Company and each of its Consolidated Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Laws relating to labor, employment, termination of employment or similar matters, including but not limited to Laws relating to discrimination, disability, labor relations, hours of work, payment of wages and overtime wages, pay equity, immigration, workers compensation, working conditions, employee scheduling, occupational safety and health, family and medical leave, and employee terminations, and have not engaged in any unfair labor practices or similar prohibited practices.

The Company has provided to Parent a copy of all written policies and procedures related to the Companys and its Consolidated Subsidiaries employees. 

    #####

Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and the Company and Parent shall promptly mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to their respective stockholders upon such effectiveness. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the Transactions, and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

The information supplied or to be supplied by either Parent or the Company, as the case may be, for inclusion in the Registration Statement shall not at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC or declared effective by the SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time each party shall notify the other party as promptly as practicable (i) upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that should be described in an amendment to the Registration Statement or in a supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (ii) after the receipt by it of any written or oral comments of the SEC with respect to, or of any written or oral request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, and shall promptly supply the other party with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to any of the foregoing filings. 

   

 (c) Subject to applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity, the consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the Transactions, that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed or conditioned. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each party shall consult with the other party prior to responding to any communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions.

or adjourning the Company Stockholders Meeting to obtain a quorum or solicit
additional proxies; _provided_ that the Company shall not postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholders Meeting for any other reason without the prior
written consent of Parent (which prior written consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Companys obligations pursuant to this
_Section 6.3(a)_ shall not be affected by (i) the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or its
stockholders of any Takeover Proposal or (ii) a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (other than a Company Right).

 6.4 _NASDAQ Listing_. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger in exchange for the Company Common Stock to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 6.5 _Employee Matters_. 

    

 (a) The Company shall cause the employment or services of all Employees of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries (other than those identified by Parent prior to the Closing as not requiring termination) to be terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that such termination of employment or services shall be contingent upon the Effective Time actually occurring. 

   

 (b) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent or its Affiliates may, but shall be under no obligation to, make an offer of employment, effective as of the Effective Time or thereafter, or hire any of the Employees of the Company who are actively employed with the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such offer of employment to an Employee shall be contingent upon the Effective Time actually occurring. Employees of the Company who continue as Employees of Parent or who affirmatively accept an offer of employment from a controlled Affiliate of Parent and commence working for Parent or its controlled Affiliates on the Closing Date are hereinafter referred to as the " _Business Employees_." Parent or its controlled Affiliates shall determine, in its or their sole and absolute discretion, the terms and conditions of employment to be offered to any Business Employee and are under no obligation to employ any Business Employee for any particular period of time. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent Parent or its controlled Affiliates from terminating the employment of any Business Employee at any time after the Effective Time for any reason (or no reason). Parent agrees that any employee benefit plans in which the Business Employees are eligible to participate shall take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual thereunder, except for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits, service by Business Employees with the Company and its Affiliates as if such service were with Parent or its controlled Affiliates, to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Benefit Plan. Parent shall, or shall cause its controlled Affiliates to: (i)
waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Business
Employees and their eligible dependents under any benefit plan of Parent or
its controlled Affiliates that provides health or medical benefits in which
such Business Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing
(a " _Parent Welfare Plan_ "), other than any limitations that were in effect
with respect to such employees as of the Closing under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-
pocket maximums incurred by any Business Employee and his or her eligible
dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately
prior to the Closing during the portion of the calendar year prior to the
Closing in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums
under Parent Welfare Plans that provide health or medical benefits in which
they are eligible to participate after the Closing in the same plan year in
which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred
and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability
requirement that would otherwise be applicable to any Business Employee and
his or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing, in each case to the
extent such Business Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Benefit Plan
prior to the Closing. 

   

 (c) Not later than 10 Business Days prior to and contingent upon the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate all of the Company Benefit Plans maintained by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries subject to the requirements of Sections 401(a) and 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to terminate (1) any obligation it has to make payments under any employment or retention agreements or payments otherwise provided for in this Agreement or (2) any Company Benefit Plan identified by Parent at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing. Payments in respect of terminated Company Benefit Plans shall be made upon the Closing to the extent permitted by Sections 401(a) and 409A of the Code. To the extent payment upon Closing is not permitted by Sections 401(a) and 409A of the Code, the Company shall vest payments and benefits under such terminated Company Benefit Plans and payments and benefits under employment or retention agreements for employees who will not continue in the employ of Parent and its Affiliates. To the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, the Company shall establish and fund a rabbi trust or similar funding arrangement for any such payments not made at Closing, which will be distributed at the earliest time permitted in accordance with the terms of such underlying Company Benefit Plans and the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The rabbi trust shall provide that upon satisfaction of all amounts the remainder will revert to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or its controlled Affiliates shall continue, or cause to be continued for the duration of the applicable COBRA continuation period, the health and medical benefits for the Employees of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries under the arrangements that exist immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Health Plans_ "); _provided_ , that if it is not possible for Parent or its controlled Affiliates to continue the Company Health Plans as a result of the termination of such Company Health Plan as of the Closing Date, the Parent or its controlled Affiliate shall either (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain replacement arrangements that replicate the Company Health Plans or (ii) cause such benefits to be provided pursuant to the health and medical benefit arrangements of a controlled Affiliate that most closely approximate the 

   ##### 

  

    

benefits provided pursuant to the Company Health Plans. At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action to cause the
account balances and/or accrued benefits of the Company Employees under the
Company 401(k) Plan, to be fully vested and non-forfeitable as of the Closing
Date provided that such actions shall be contingent on the Effective Time
occurring. Each Business Employee with an outstanding plan loan under the
Company 401(k) Plan shall be permitted to roll over his or her
"eligible rollover distribution" from the Company 401(k) Plan to a qualified
defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or its controlled Affiliate
for the Business Employees, including any outstanding plan loan or promissory
note under the Company 401(k) Plan to the extent allowable under such plan.
Except as set forth above, at or prior to the Effective Time (or, if not
permitted under applicable Law, as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time in accordance with their terms) the Company shall pay out to each
Employee of the Company or its Consolidated Subsidiaries all benefits accrued
by such Employee of the Company or its Consolidated Subsidiaries under the
Company Benefit Plans. The Company shall provide Parent reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon all documentation, including
any resolutions to be adopted by the Company, and to effectuate the
termination of the Company Benefit Plans and vesting of the Companys
matching contributions under the Company 401(k) Plan. 

   

 (d) In the event that (i) any Employee of the Company or its Consolidated Subsidiary who does not have a retention agreement does not continue in the employ of Parent or its controlled Affiliate on or after the Closing or (ii) the employment of any Business Employee who does not have a retention agreement is terminated by Parent or its controlled Affiliate without cause within twelve months following the Closing, then the Company (in the case of the foregoing Section 6.5(d)(i)) or the Parent (in the case of the foregoing Section 6.5(d)(ii)), agrees to, or will cause its controlled Affiliate to, provide such Employee with severance benefits no less than the severance benefits set forth on Section 5.2(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (e) The Company shall be permitted to pay retention/annual bonuses and miscellaneous transaction-related compensation, consistent with the terms set forth on Section 5.2(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to Employees of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.5 to the contrary, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates, or shall limit the right of Parent or its respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates following the Effective Time. If (i) a party other than the parties hereto makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates even though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then, solely with respect to the employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates at issue, such provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect with respect thereto. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (g) No provision of this Section 6.5 shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any Business Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of employment with Parent or any of its Affiliates and no provision of this Section 6.5 shall create any rights in any Business Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of any compensation or benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any employee benefit plan or arrangement that has been or may be established by Parent or any of its Affiliates. No provision of this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify or terminate at any time any employee benefit plans or arrangements of Parent of any of its Affiliates. 

   

 (h) The Company shall be responsible for fulfilling all requirements under WARN, including but not limited to issuing all notices required under WARN or similar state laws (a " _WARN Notice_ ") and/or to make any payments required to be made to any Employee of the Company or its Consolidated Subsidiaries under WARN or similar state laws; provided, that Parent shall have an opportunity to review and approve such WARN Notice no later than seven Business Days before such WARN Notice will be issued to an Employee of the Company or its Consolidated Subsidiaries, such approval by Parent to not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

   

 (a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless and advance expenses to the present and former directors and officers of the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries, and any such Person presently or formerly serving at the request of the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, trustee or fiduciary of any other Person or under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, amounts paid in settlement or other liabilities (collectively, " _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") incurred in connection with any Proceeding arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. In the event of any such Indemnified Liabilities, (i) Parent shall advance to such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification and complies with other applicable provisions imposed under the Investment Company Act and interpretations thereof by the SEC or its staff and (ii) Parent and the applicable Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of such matter. If any Indemnified Party is required to bring any action to enforce rights or to collect moneys due under this _Section 6.6(a)_ and is successful in obtaining a decision that it is entitled to enforcement of any right or collection of any money in such action, Parent shall reimburse such Indemnified Party for all of its expenses reasonably incurred in connection with bringing and pursuing such action, including reasonable attorneys fees and costs. 

    ##### 

 

   

 (b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall obtain a directors and officers liability insurance policy that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to Proceedings against such directors or officers arising from facts or events occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, which insurance shall contain identical or better coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by the Companys current policies (the " _Company D andO Policies_"); _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to expend more than 200% of the current amount expended by the Company for the Company DandO Policies for a twelve-month period (the " _Current Premium_ ") to maintain or procure directors and officers insurance coverage for a comparable six-year period, which annual premium is set forth on Section 6.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.6(b), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for 200% of the Current Premium;  _provided_ , _further_ , that officers and directors of the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide customary representations and warranties to the responsible insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.6(b) to the contrary, (i) Parent may fulfill its (and the Surviving Companys) obligations under this Section 6.6(b) by purchasing, and (ii) the Company may purchase for up to 200% of the Current Premium a directors and officers insurance policy or a "tail" policy under the Company DandO Policies, in either case that (A) has an effective term of six years from the Effective Time, (B) covers those Persons who are currently covered by the Company DandO Policies and for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time and (C) contains terms with respect to coverage and amounts that are identical or better than those contained in the Company DandO Policies _provided_ , that, if the Company purchases such insurance policy or "tail" policy, Parents obligation under this Section 6.6(b) shall be deemed to have been satisfied in full. 

  

 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.6(a), upon learning of any Proceeding described above, shall promptly notify Parent; _provided_ , that failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of Parent under Section 6.6(a) unless and to the extent that Parent is actually and materially prejudiced as a consequence. 

  

 (d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6. 

  

 (e) At the Effective Time, Parent shall automatically, fully, unconditionally and irrevocably assume and agree to perform and discharge, jointly and severally with the Surviving Company, all of the obligations of the Company under each indemnification agreement between the Company and any of its directors and officers listed on Section 6.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (substantially in the form filed under Exhibit 

   ##### 

  

 

10.37 to the Companys Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003) and any
other similar agreements. 

   

 (f) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise. 

  

6.7 _No Solicitation._  

   

 (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, Consolidated Subsidiaries, and its and each of their respective officers, directors, trustees, managers, employees, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other advisors, representatives and agents (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated immediately any discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to, or that are intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly demand that each Person (other than Parent or its Affiliates or Representatives) that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with respect to the Companys consideration of a possible Takeover Proposal immediately return or destroy (which destruction shall be certified in writing by such Person to the Company) all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to Section 6.7(c), the Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates, Consolidated Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives not to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, induce, knowingly encourage or take any other action with the intent to solicit, initiate, induce or encourage (including by way of furnishing or disclosing information) any inquiries or the making or submission or implementation of any proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to its stockholders) with respect to any Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement, discussions or understanding with respect to any Takeover Proposal (including any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding or confidentiality agreement) or enter into any Contract or understanding (including any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding or confidentiality agreement) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate, or that is intended to or that would reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment of, termination of or failure to consummate, the Merger or any other Transaction, (iii) initiate or participate in any way in any negotiations or discussions regarding, or furnish or disclose to any Person (other than Parent or its Affiliates or Representatives) any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate or in furtherance of any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, or (iv) grant any approval pursuant to any Takeover Statute to any Person (other than Parent or its Affiliates) or transaction (other than the Transactions) or waiver or release under any standstill or any similar agreement with respect to equity securities of the Company. 

  

 (b) The Company shall advise Parent in writing of any request for information or any Takeover Proposal and the terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including the identity of the Person (or group of Persons) 

   ##### 

  

 

making such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry) and the Company shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials received by the
Company in connection with any of the foregoing, and the identity of the
Person (or group of Persons) making any such request, Takeover Proposal or
inquiry or with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place. The
Company agrees that it shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status and the material terms and conditions (including
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Takeover Proposal or
inquiry and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis of any
information requested of or provided by the Company and as to the status of
all discussions or negotiations with respect to any such request, Takeover
Proposal or inquiry. 

   

 (c) If on or after the date of this Agreement and at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, (i) the Company receives a bona fide unsolicited Takeover Proposal (under circumstances in which the Company has complied in all material respects with the provisions of Sections 6.7(a) and (b)); (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with reputable outside legal counsel and financial advisors experienced in such matters, that (x) failure to consider such Takeover Proposal would be a breach of the duties of the directors of the Company under applicable Law and (y) such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal; and (iii) the Company gives Parent at least two (2) Business Days prior written notice of the identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and the Companys intention to furnish information to, or participate in discussions or negotiations with, the Person making such Takeover Proposal then, subject to compliance with this Section 6.7(c), the Company may: 

  

 (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Person who has made the unsolicited bona fide Takeover Proposal and provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made such Takeover Proposal if the Company (A) receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement with terms (including standstill) no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary for the Company to comply with its obligations under this Agreement) and (B) provides Parent a copy of all such information that has not previously been delivered to Parent simultaneously with delivery to such Person, and 

   

 (ii) after fulfilling its obligations under Section 6.7(d) below, adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, including entering into an agreement with respect thereto, a Takeover Proposal (a " _Takeover Approval_ "). 

   

 If on or after the date of this Agreement and at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with reputable outside legal counsel and financial advisors experienced in such matters, that recommendation of the Company Matters to the Companys stockholders would be a breach of the duties of the directors of the Company under applicable Law, the Company may (A) withdraw or qualify (or modify or amend in 

   ##### 

  

 

a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw or qualify (or
modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, adoption,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors of
the Company of the Company Matters, including the recommendation of the Board
of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and (B) take
any action or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation (any action described in clause (A) and (B) referred to
collectively with any Takeover Approval as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "). 

   

 (d) Upon any determination that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company shall provide to Parent a written notice (a " _Notice of a Superior Proposal_ ") (i) advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal, (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including the amount per share that the stockholders of the Company will receive and including a copy of all written materials provided to or by the Company in connection with such Superior Proposal and (iii) identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal. The Company shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith with Parent during the five calendar day period following the Notice of a Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new five calendar day period) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with a Company Recommendation without a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. If Parent does not make an offer that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its reasonable good faith judgment (after consultation with reputable outside legal counsel and financial advisors experienced in such matters ) to be as favorable to the holders of the Company Common Stock (other than Parent and its Affiliates), as such Superior Proposal, and the Company has complied in all material respects with Section 6.7(c) above, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii). 

  

 (e) Other than as permitted by _Section 6.7(c)_, neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company shall make any Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the Company Matters or any other approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing any Takeover Statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the Transactions. 

  

 (f) The Company shall provide Parent with prompt written notice of any meeting of the Companys Board of Directors at which the Companys Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Takeover Proposal (such written notice shall in any event be reasonably in advance of such meeting). 

   ##### 

  

  

6.8 _Parent Recommendations._  

   

 (a) If on or after the date of this Agreement and at any time prior to Parent Stockholders Meeting, the Board of Directors of Parent shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with reputable outside legal counsel and financial advisors experienced in such matters, that recommendation of the Parent Matters to Parents stockholders would be a breach of the duties of the directors of Parent under applicable Law, Parent may (A) withdraw or qualify (or modify or amend in a manner adverse to the Company), or publicly propose to withdraw or qualify (or modify or amend in a manner adverse to the Company), the approval, adoption, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors of Parent of the Parent Matters, including the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Recommendation_ "), and (B) take any action or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the Parent Stockholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Parent Recommendation (any action described in clause (A) and (B) being referred to as a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). 

   

 (b) Other than as permitted by Section 6.8(a), neither Parent nor the Board of Directors of Parent shall make any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Parent Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the Parent Matters or any other approval of the Board of Directors of Parent. 

   

6.9 _Access to Information._  

   

 (a) Upon reasonable notice, subject to applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Consolidated Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other Representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, Contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, such party shall, and shall cause its Consolidated Subsidiaries to, make available (including via EDGAR) to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of applicable Laws (other than reports or documents that such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable Law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request. From the date of this Agreement through the Closing, subject to applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly provide each other with monthly and quarterly information regarding its portfolio company investments for informational purposes. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide Parent with all information reasonably requested by Parent regarding the Companys portfolio companies, including information of third parties, and cooperate fully with Parent in connection with its diligence of the Companys portfolio companies.

 10.10 _Disclosure Schedule._ Before entry into this Agreement, Parent and the Company each delivered to the other party a schedule (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule" and the "Company Disclosure Schedule", respectively, each, a "Disclosure Schedule") that sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in Article III or IV, as applicable, or to one or more covenants contained herein; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Disclosure Schedule shall be numbered to correspond with the sections and subsections contained in this Agreement. The disclosure in any section or subsection of each Disclosure Schedule, shall qualify only (i) the corresponding section or subsection, as the case may be, of this Agreement, (ii) other sections or subsections of this Agreement to the extent specifically cross-referenced in such section or subsection thereof, and (iii) other sections or subsections of this Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure would be applicable to such other sections or subsections. 

  

 10.11 _Conforming Amendment._ If Parent determines to merge the Company into Parent directly instead of merging Merger Sub into the Company, then, upon the prior approval of the Company (such prior approval not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld), the parties hereto shall enter into an amendment (the "Conforming Amendment") to this Agreement with the other parties reflecting such structural change and amending such provisions of this Agreement as may be necessary to effectuate the Conforming Amendment.
