ARTICLE  II

 

 

CONVERSION  OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES;

 

OPTIONS  AND OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS

 

 

2.1 _Conversion  or Cancellation of Shares_.  At the  Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  of  any
stockholder:

 

 

(a) _Company  Common Stock_.  Each  share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to  the  Effective Time, other than
Exception Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall  be  converted into and
constitute the right to receive, as provided in and subject  to the
provisions of Section 2.1(c), (i) an amount of shares of Acquirer  Common 
Stock equal to 0.65 times the Designated Ratio (the "Per Share Stock 
Consideration"), and (ii) subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 7.1(f), 
$8.925 in cash (the "Per Share Cash Consideration," and together with the
Per  Share Stock Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").

 

 

For  purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings 
indicated:

 

 

"Designated  Ratio" means 0.70, subject to adjustment in accordance with
Section 2.3 and/or  Section 7.1(f).

 

 

"Dissenting  Shares" shall mean shares of Company Common Stock, the holders
of which have  perfected and not withdrawn or lost their appraisal rights
with respect to  such  shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.

 

 

"Exception  Shares" means shares of Company Common Stock owned or held, other
than in a bona  fide fiduciary or agency capacity or in satisfaction of a
debt previously  contracted in good faith, by Company or by Acquiror.

 

 

(b) _Rights  as Stockholders; Stock Transfers_.  Each  Exception Share
shall cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired  and  shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange 
therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately  prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception Shares and
Dissenting Shares,  is hereinafter defined as an "Old Share." Old Shares
shall cease to be  outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and  each  holder of a certificate (an "Old Certificate") formerly
representing Old Shares  shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares, except  the right to receive, as applicable, without
interest, upon exchange of such  Old  Certificate in accordance with this
Article II (i) any dividends with respect  to  Company Common Stock with a
record date prior to the Effective Time but unpaid  as of the Effective Time
and (ii) the consideration to which such holder  may be  entitled pursuant
to this Article II.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) _No  Fractional Shares_.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates  nor  scrip for fractional shares of
Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued in the  Merger. Each holder who
otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction  of a  share of Acquiror
Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without  interest) in an
amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest  to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account  all  shares
of Company Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time) by the  last 
reported closing sale price of one share of Acquiror Common Stock as
reported  on  the NYSE Composite Transactions Reporting System (as reported
in the Wall  Street  Journal or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source) (the  "Acquiror Share Price"). No such holder shall be
entitled to dividends, voting  rights or any other rights in respect of any
fractional share.

 

 

(d) _Acquiror  Sub Common Stock_.  Each  share of Acquiror Sub Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be unchanged and
shall remain issued and outstanding  as one  share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

 

2.2 _Exchange  of Old Certificates; Payment of the Consideration_.

 

 

(a) _Appointment  of Exchange Agent_.  Until  the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall make available  on a  timely basis or cause
to be made available to an exchange agent agreed upon  by  Acquiror and
Company (the "Exchange Agent") (1) cash in an amount sufficient to  allow the
Exchange Agent to make all payments that may be required pursuant  to  this
Article II and (2) certificates, or at Acquiror's option, evidence of  shares
in book entry form, representing the shares of Acquiror Common Stock  ("New
Certificates"), each to be given to the holders of Company Common Stock in 
exchange for Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II. Upon such 
anniversary, any such cash or New Certificates remaining in the possession 
of  the Exchange Agent (together with any earnings in respect thereof)
shall  be  delivered to Acquiror. Any holder of Old Certificates who has not
theretofore  exchanged such Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II
shall thereafter be  entitled to look exclusively to Acquiror, and only as a
general creditor  thereof, for the consideration to which such holder may be
entitled upon  exchange of such Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto, shall be  liable  to any holder of Old Certificates for any amount
properly delivered to a  public  official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar  laws.

 

 

(b) _Exchange  Procedures_.  Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than ten days  thereafter, Acquiror shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail or deliver to  each  individual, bank, corporation,
partnership, trust, association or other entity  or organization (a "Person")
who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a  holder of record of
Company Common Stock, a form of letter of transmittal  (which  shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title  to Old 
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to 
the  Exchange Agent) containing instructions for use in effecting the
surrender  of  Old Certificates in exchange for the consideration to which
such holder may  be  entitled pursuant to this Article II. After completion
of the allocation  procedure set forth in Section 2.1(c) and upon surrender
to the Exchange  Agent  of an Old Certificate for cancellation together with
such letter of transmittal  or Election Form, as the case may be, duly
executed and completed in accordance  with the instructions thereto, the
holder of such Old Certificate shall promptly  be provided in exchange
therefor, but in no event later than ten business  days  after due
surrender, a New Certificate representing the New Shares and/or  a  check in
the amount to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article  II, and
the Old Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No  interest
will accrue or be paid with respect to any property to be delivered  upon
surrender of Old Certificates.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) _Transfer  to Holder other than Existing Holder_.  If any  cash payment
is to be made in a name other than that in which the Old  Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a  condition of
such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall  pay  any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the making of such cash 
payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Old 
Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such 
holder or requesting person, or shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction  of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable. If any  New  Certificate representing shares of Acquiror Common
Stock is to be issued  in the  name of other than the registered holder of
the Old Certificate surrendered  in  exchange therefor, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the  Old  Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by  an  appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,  and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent  in  advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of  a 
certificate representing shares of Acquiror Common Stock in a name other 
than  that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered, or
required  for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting person,
or shall  establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such  tax has  been paid or is not payable.

 

 

(d) _Dividends_.  No  dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time  with respect to Acquiror Common Stock shall be paid
to the holder of any  unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof
shall surrender such  Old  Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
After the surrender of a  Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the
record holder thereof  shall  be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without  any  interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares  of  Acquiror Common Stock represented
by such New Certificate.

 

 

(e) _Transfers_.  At or  after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer  books of the Surviving Corporation of Old
Shares.

 

 

(f) _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.  If any  Old Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making  of an  affidavit
of that fact by the Person claiming such Old Certificate to be  lost, 
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the 
Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount  as the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may direct as
indemnity  against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Old  Certificate, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall, in
exchange  for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate, pay or cause to
be paid  the  consideration deliverable in respect of the Old Shares
formerly represented  by  such Old Certificate pursuant to this Article II.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.3 _Adjustments  to Acquiror Common Stock_.  If  Acquiror changes (or
Acquiror's Board of Directors sets a related record date  that will occur
before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or  kind of  shares of
Acquiror Common Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock  dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar  transaction,
then the Designated Ratio will be adjusted proportionately to  account for
such change.

 

 

2.4 _Options  and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 

 

(a) At  the  Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part  of  any holder thereof, each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock  (a "Company Option") that is outstanding and
unexercised, whether vested or  unvested, exercisable or unexercisable,
immediately prior thereto shall be  deemed to constitute a fully vested
option (a "New Option") to purchase, on the  same terms and conditions as
were applicable under the terms of the stock  option  plan under which the
Company Option was granted, such number of shares of  Acquiror Common Stock
and at such an exercise price per share determined  as  follows:

 

 

(A) _Number  of Shares_.  The  number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
subject to a New Option shall be  equal  to the product of (I) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock purchasable  upon exercise of the Company
Option and (II) the Option Conversion Ratio  (as  defined below), the
product being rounded to the nearest whole share;  and

 

 

(B) _Exercise  Price_.  The  exercise price per share of Acquiror Common
Stock purchasable upon exercise  of a  New Option shall be equal to (I) the
exercise price per share of Company  Common  Stock under the Company Option
divided by (II) the Option Conversion Ratio,  the  quotient being rounded to
the nearest cent.

 

 

The  exercise price and the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
purchasable  pursuant to the Company Options shall be determined in a manner
consistent  with  the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. With respect
to any such  Company Options that are "incentive stock options" (as defined
in Section 422(b)  of the Code), the foregoing adjustments shall be effected
in a manner consistent  with Section 424(a) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Options
(whether vested or unvested)  that are held by employees of the Company who
are not Continuing Employees  (as  such term is Defined in Section 5.10(a))
or that are held by directors of  Company shall be entitled to a cash payment
from the Company at the Effective  Time in an amount equal to the excess of
(i) the sum of (A) the Per Share  Cash  Consideration plus (B) (1) the
Designated Ratio multiplied by (2) the Acquiror  Share Price over (ii) the
per share exercise price of such Company Option,  subject to any required
withholding of taxes. Prior to the Effective Time,  Company, or Company's
Board of Directors or an appropriate committee thereof,  will take all action
necessary on its part to give effect to the provisions  of  this Section
2.4(a) and shall take such other actions reasonably requested  by Acquiror to
give effect to the foregoing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) For  purposes of this Agreement, "Option Conversion Ratio" shall mean the
sum of (i)  (A) 0.65 times (B) the Designated Ratio plus (ii) (A) the Per
Share Cash  Consideration divided by (B) the Acquiror Share Price.

 

 

(c) Prior  to  the Effective Time, Acquiror shall take all corporate action
necessary to  reserve for future issuance a sufficient additional number of
shares of Acquiror  Common Stock to provide for the satisfaction of its
obligations, if any,  with  respect to the New Options. On the Closing Date,
or the next Business Day  thereafter if necessary, Acquiror shall file a
registration statement on  Form  S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the Acquiror  Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
the New Options and shall use its  reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement  (and to maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained  therein) for so long as
such New Options remain outstanding.

 

 

2.5 _Dissenting  Stockholders_.  (a)  Each  Dissenting Share shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive  the  Merger Consideration
hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled  only to  such rights as
are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Company shall give  Acquiror prompt
notice upon receipt by Company of any such demands for payment  of the fair
value of such shares of Company Common Stock and of withdrawals  of  such
notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to applicable law  (any 
stockholder duly making such demand being hereinafter called a "Dissenting 
Stockholder"), and Acquiror shall have the right to participate in all 
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Any payments 
made  in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving 
Company.

 

 

(b) If  any  Dissenting Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure  to  perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent under
Section 262 of the DGCL  at or  prior to the Effective Time, each of such
holder's shares of Company Common  Stock shall be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration  in  accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Agreement.

 

 

2.6 _Withholding  Taxes_.  Acquiror or the Exchange Agent, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct  and  withhold from the Merger Consideration or
other amounts otherwise payable  pursuant to this Agreement to holders of
Company Common Stock such  amounts as Acquiror or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, reasonably  determines in good faith it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect  to  the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local  or  non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such  withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Purchaser or
the Exchange Agent,  as applicable, to the applicable taxing authority, and
(ii) shall be  treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to  the holder of the Company Common Stock in respect of which such 
deduction and withholding was made.

Security Act of  1974,  as amended ("ERISA"), and deferred compensation,
stock option, stock purchase,  stock appreciation rights or stock-related
award incentive and bonus plans  ("Company Benefit Plans"), and each Company
Benefit Plan which has received a  favorable opinion letter from the Internal
Revenue Service National Office,  including, but not limited to, any master
or prototype plan, has been separately  identified. True and complete copies
of all Company Benefit Plans, including  any  trust instruments, insurance
contracts and with respect to any employee stock  ownership plan, loan

(b) All  Company Benefit Plans are in substantial compliance, in form and
operation,  with  ERISA, including the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and
the Code, to the  extent  applicable, and other applicable laws. Each
Company Benefit Plan which is  subject to ERISA (an "ERISA Plan") that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
(a "Pension Plan") and that is  intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code, has received a  favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service (the "IRS")  covering all tax law changes, including those
changes under the Economic  Growth  and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001 and has applied or will apply to  the  IRS for such favorable
determination letter within the applicable period  under  Section 401(b) of
the Code, and Company is not aware of any circumstances  likely  to result
in the loss of the qualification of such Plan under Section 401(a)  of  the
Code. No Company Benefit Plan is funded by a trust described in Section 
501(c)(9) of the Code. Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has
engaged  in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming the
taxable  period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could
subject Company  or any subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the  Code  or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither Company nor
any of its subsidiaries has  incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax or
penalty imposed by Section  4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 

 

(c) No  liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected  to  be incurred by Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect
to any ongoing,  frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within the
meaning of Section  4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
any of them, or  any  entity which is a member of a "controlled group" with
Company under Section  4001(a)(14) of ERISA or considered one employer with
Company under Section  414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code ("ERISA
Affiliate"). Company and its  subsidiaries have not incurred and do not
expect to incur any withdrawal  liability with respect to a "multiemployer
plan", within the meaning of Sections  3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, under
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless  of whether based on
contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a  "reportable event",
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the  30-day reporting
requirement has not been waived or extended, other than  pursuant to Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation Reg. Section 4043.66, has  been  required to be
filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within  the  12-month
period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed  in 
connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(d) All  contributions required to be made under each Company Benefit Plan,
as of  the  date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in
respect of each  Company Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and
reflected in its Company  Financial Statements. Neither any Pension Plan nor
any single-employer plan  sponsored by an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (whether  or not waived) within the meaning of Section
412 of the Code or Section 302  of  ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an
outstanding funding waiver. It is not  reasonably anticipated that the
required minimum contributions to any Pension  Plan under Section 412 of the
Code will be increased by application of Section  412(l) of the Code. Neither
Company nor any of its subsidiaries has provided,  or  is required to
provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer  plan of an
ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the  Code.

(e) Under  each Pension Plan that is a single-employer plan, as of the date
hereof,  the  actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities", within the  meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the  actuarial assumptions contained in such
Pension Plan's most recent actuarial  valuation), did not exceed the then
current value of the assets of such Pension  Plan, and there has been no
material change in the financial condition of  such  Pension Plan since the
last day of the most recent plan year.

 

 

(f) As  of the  date hereof, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of
Company threatened,  litigation relating to the Company Benefit Plans. Other
than as set forth  in  _Section  3.17(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter_
,  neither  Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health  and  life benefits under any ERISA Plan or collective
bargaining agreement other  than  as required to comply with Section 4980B
of the Code or Part 6 of Title I  of  ERISA. Other than as set forth in
_Section  3.17(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ ,  Company  or its
subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without 
incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of benefits accrued 
and  claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination.

 

 

(g) There  has  been no amendment to, announcement by Company or any of its
subsidiaries  relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Company  Benefit Plan which would materially increase the expense
of maintaining such  plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor
for the most recent  fiscal  year, except to the extent required by law.
Other than as set forth in  _Section  3.17(g) of the Company Disclosure
Letter_ ,  none of  the execution of this Agreement, stockholder approval of
this Agreement or  the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will (i) entitle any  employees to severance pay or any increase in severance
pay upon any termination  of employment after the date hereof, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment  or  vesting or result in any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or  otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable  or  result in any other obligation
pursuant to, any of the Company Benefit Plans,  (iii) limit or restrict the
right of Company or, after the consummation of  the  transactions
contemplated hereby, Acquiror, to merge, amend or terminate  any of  the
Company Benefit Plans or (iv) result in payments under any of the Company 
Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 
280G  of the Code.

 

 

(h) Each  Company Benefit Plan that is a deferred compensation plan is in
substantial  compliance with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent
applicable. Any  voluntary election by a participant to defer post-2004
compensation into  any  such plan was effected in a time and manner in
compliance with Section 409A  of  the Code.

 

 

3.18 _Environmental  Matters_.  (i) To  Company's knowledge, there is no
environmental condition, situation, or incident  on, at, or concerning any
property currently owned, leased or used by Company  or  its subsidiaries
that could give rise to an action or liability under any  Environmental Law
or common law theory; (ii) there are no state or federal  liens  on property
owned by Company or its subsidiaries resulting from an environmental  cleanup
by any federal or state authority; (iii) neither Company nor any  of its 
subsidiaries is subject to any decree, order, writ, judgment or injunction 
issued pursuant to any applicable Environmental Laws and, to Company's 
knowledge, there is no event, cause or condition which would reasonably be 
expected to give rise to or form the basis of such a decree, order, writ, 
judgment or injunction; (iv) neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries 
has  received any written or oral notice under the citizen suit provision of
any  Environmental Laws; (v) neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has
received  any unresolved written or oral request for information, notice of
violation,  demand letter, administrative inquiry, complaint or claim from
any person,  including any governmental entity, involving the alleged
violation of any  Environmental Laws. "Environmental Laws" means all
applicable local, state and  federal environmental, health and safety laws
and regulations, including  the  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the
Comprehensive Environmental  Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and
the Occupational Safety and  Health  Act, each as amended, regulations
promulgated thereunder, and state  counterparts.

had,  or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

not be obtained on the Closing Date.

satisfied or in a material violation of  any  provision of this Agreement.

April Herrington, KeyBank National  Association, KeyBank National

be notified to Company designated by Acquiror within three  business days
after the date of this Agreement in accordance with the procedure  set forth

receives  such  request; provided that such time period shall be three
business days in the  case  of any request by Company to take any action not
permitted by Section  5.1(a)(vi).

 

 

(b) _Acquiror  Conduct of Business Pending the Effective Time_.  Acquiror
agrees, as to itself and its subsidiaries, that, except insofar  as  Company
shall otherwise consent in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably 
withheld or delayed) or except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this

(i) amend  its  articles of incorporation or bylaws in a manner that would
materially and  adversely affect the economic benefits of the Merger to the
holders of Company  Common stock,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) take  any  action that is intended or may reasonably be expected to
result in any of  its  representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement being or becoming  untrue in any material respect at any time prior
to the Effective Time, or  in  any of the conditions to the Merger set forth
in Article VI not being satisfied  or in a material violation of any

Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

None  of  the foregoing shall be deemed to prohibit Acquiror from making any
disposition  or acquisition or from agreeing to issue capital stock of
Acquiror in connection  therewith, provided that any such transaction would
not reasonably be expected  to (1) have a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquiror's financial condition, (2)  materially delay the Closing Date, (3)
materially adversely affect the ability  of Company or Acquiror to obtain any
Regulatory Approval or (4) prevent or  impede the Merger from qualifying as a
tax-free reorganization within the  meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

other property; and (b) Company may pay  quarterly dividends on outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock at a rate  not  to exceed $0.15 per share per
quarter, on substantially the same record and  payment date schedules as have
been utilized in the past (provided that the  declaration of the last
quarterly dividend by Company prior to the Effective  Time and the payment
thereof shall be coordinated with Acquiror so that,  with  respect to such
quarter, a holder of Company Common Stock will receive a  dividend on either
such holder's shares of Company Common Stock or the shares of  Acquiror
Common Stock received by such holder in the Merger, but will not  receive
dividends on both Company Common Stock and Acquiror Common Stock  received in
the Merger).

 

 

5.3 _Acquisition  Proposals_.  d)  Company  shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions,  negotiations and
communications with any third parties with respect to any  Acquisition
Proposal. Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries nor any  of its 
respective executive officers and directors or the executive officers and 
directors of any of its subsidiaries shall, and it shall direct and use all 
reasonable best efforts to cause its executive officers and agents,
including  any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or by
any of  its  subsidiaries (collectively, its "Representatives"), not to,
initiate, solicit or  encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the
making or implementation  of any Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any
negotiations concerning, or  provide any confidential information or data to,
or have any discussions  with,  any Person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or otherwise facilitate any  effort or attempt to implement or make
an Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Acquisition  Proposal" means any proposal or offer with respect to the
following involving  Company or any of its material subsidiaries: (i) any
merger, consolidation,  share exchange, business combination or other similar
transaction; (ii) any  sale, lease, exchange, pledge, transfer or other
disposition of 35% or more  of  its consolidated assets or liabilities in a
single transaction or series  of  transactions; (iii) any tender offer or
exchange offer for 10% or more of  the  outstanding shares of its capital
stock; or (iv) any public announcement  of a  proposal, plan or intention to
do any of the foregoing or any agreement to  engage in any of the foregoing,
other than the Merger provided for in this  Agreement.

 

 

Company  shall ensure that the executive officers, directors and agents of
Company  and  its subsidiaries and its other Representatives are aware of
the restrictions  described in this Section 5.3 as reasonably necessary to
avoid violations  thereof. It is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth  in  this Section 5.3 by any executive officer,
director, agent or other  Representative of Company or its subsidiaries, at
the direction or with the  consent of Company or its subsidiaries, shall be
deemed to be a breach of  this  Section 5.3 by Company. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, Company shall (i) immediately,
and in any event within twenty-four  hours, advise Acquiror, orally and in
writing, of (A) the receipt by it (or  any  of the other Persons referred to
above) of any Acquisition Proposal, any  request  for information from, or
any request for, or initiation or continuation of,  any  negotiations or
discussions with Company or any of its subsidiaries or any  of  their
respective Representatives, in connection with any Acquisition Proposal  or 
the possibility or consideration of making an Acquisition Proposal or any 
inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal  (any of the foregoing "Acquisition Proposal Interest"), (B) the
material terms  and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Proposal Interest  (whether written or oral), and (C) the identity of the
Person making such  Acquisition Proposal or expressing any such Acquisition
Proposal Interest,  (ii)  prior to providing any such Person from whom an
Acquisition Proposal or  Acquisition Proposal Interest has been received with
any material non-public  information, notify Acquiror of the receipt of the
same (and promptly provide  to  Acquiror any material non-public information
regarding Company provided to  any  other Person that was not previously
provided to Acquiror, such additional  information to be provided no later
than the next business day after the  date of  provision of such information
to such other Person) and (iii) keep Acquiror  fully informed of the status
and details of any such Acquisition Proposal  or  Acquisition Proposal
Interest and any developments with respect thereto.  Company  shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality  or 
standstill agreements in accordance with the terms thereof.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  Section 5.3(a), Company (i) may permit any Person to
make an Acquisition  Proposal to the Board of Directors of Company, if the
Board of Directors  of  Company with the advice of independent counsel (who
may be Company's regularly  engaged independent counsel) determines in good
faith that the failure to  do so  would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duty of the Board of Directors of  Company under applicable law, (ii) may
furnish information concerning its  business, properties or assets to any
Person pursuant to a customary  confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable to Company than those  contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
dated June 2, 2007, entered into  between Acquiror and Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") if, and only if,  such Person has on an
unsolicited basis, and in the absence of any violation  of  this Section 5.3
by Company or any of its Representatives, submitted an  Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Proposal Interest that constitutes or,  that  in the good
faith opinion of Company's Board of Directors, is reasonably likely  to
result in a Superior Proposal and (iii) may negotiate and participate  in 
discussions and negotiations with such Person concerning an Acquisition
Proposal  if, and only if, (x) such Person has on an unsolicited basis, and
in the  absence  of any violation of this Section 5.3 by Company or any of
its Representatives,  or by such Person or any of its Representatives of any
confidentiality or  standstill agreement, submitted a bona fide written
Superior Proposal (as  defined below) to Company and (y) in the good faith
opinion of Company's Board  of Directors, only after consultation with
independent outside legal counsel  to  Company, the Board of Directors of
Company has determined that engaging in  such  discussions or negotiations
is in the best interests of Company and its  stockholders and the failure to
engage in such discussions or negotiations  would  be inconsistent with the
Board's fiduciary duties to Company's stockholders  under applicable law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A  "Superior Proposal" means any Acquisition Proposal that is not conditioned
upon  the ability to obtain financing (or dependent upon financing that is
subject  to  contingencies) (A) which is for not less than 80% of the issued
and outstanding  shares of Company Common Stock or 80% of the consolidated
assets of Company  and  (B) which Company's Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after  consultation with its investment bankers, is (I) superior
to Company's  stockholders from a financial point of view and, taking into
account relevant  legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and
any other factors  that Company's Board of Directors determines to be
relevant, the identity of the  third party making such proposal, and the
conditions for completion of such  proposal, a more favorable transaction
than the Merger and (II) in the  reasonable opinion of Company's Board of
Directors, based on discussions with  Company's investment bankers and other
information known to Company's Board of  Directors, is at least as likely to
be approved and completed as the  Merger.

 

 

(c) Except  as  expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(c), neither
Company's Board of Directors  nor any committee thereof shall (i) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve  or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or
(ii) withdraw or modify, or propose  to  withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Acquiror, the approval or  recommendation referred to in Section
5.4 by Company's Board of Directors or any  such committee of this Agreement,
the Merger or the other matters contemplated  hereby or take any action or
make any statement inconsistent with such approval  (any action described in
the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), a "Change in  Company's Recommendation"),
or (iii) enter into any letter of intent, agreement  in principle or
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Company's Board of Directors, subject to the  terms of this and
the following two sentences, to the extent that it determines  in good faith,
after consultation with independent outside legal counsel,  that  the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Board's fiduciary duties to 
Company's stockholders under applicable law, may make a Change in Company's 
Recommendation. Company may make a Change in Company's Recommendation (A) at
a  time that is after the third day following Company's delivery to Acquiror
of  written notice advising Acquiror that Company's Board of Directors has 
determined that it has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material 
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, identifying the Person
making  such Superior Proposal and indicating that it intends to make a
Change in  Company's Recommendation and (B) if, during such three (3) day
period, Company  and its advisors shall have negotiated in good faith with
Acquiror to make  adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that such  Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, and  such  negotiations fail to result in the necessary
adjustments to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any Change in Company's
Recommendation, unless otherwise  directed in writing by Acquiror, this
Agreement and the Merger shall be  submitted to the stockholders of Company
for the purpose of adopting this  Agreement and approving the Merger and the
other matters contemplated hereby  at  the meeting called by Company
pursuant to Section 5.4, and nothing in this  Agreement shall be deemed to
relieve Company of such obligation. Any Change  in  Company's Recommendation
shall not permit Company's Board of Directors to  rescind or amend the
resolutions adopting this Agreement or otherwise change  the  approval of
Company's Board of Directors for purposes of causing any state  takeover
statute or other state law or provision of Company's articles of 
incorporation or by-laws to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated 
thereby.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 5.3 or
any other provision  hereof shall prohibit Company or Company's Board of
Directors from taking and  disclosing to Company's stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2 or  Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
or from making any disclosure  if,  in the good faith judgment of the Board
of Directors of Company, after  consultation with outside counsel, failure to
do so would be inconsistent  with  the Board's fiduciary duties to Company's
stockholders under applicable law;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that 
Company's Board of Directors shall not in any case make a Change in
Company's  Recommendation except in accordance with Section 5.3(c).

 

 

5.4 _Stockholder  Approval_.  Company  agrees to take, in accordance with
applicable law and its articles of  incorporation and by-laws, all action
necessary to convene a meeting of its  stockholders (including any
adjournment or postponement, the "Company Meeting"),  as promptly as
practicable to consider and vote upon the adoption and approval  of this
Agreement and the Merger and the other matters contemplated hereby.  The 
Board of Directors of Company shall recommend such adoption and approval, 
and  Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the adoption
and  approval of this Agreement by its stockholders; provided that the Board
of  Directors of Company may withdraw, modify, condition or refuse to make
such  recommendation only in accordance with Section 5.3(c) in connection
with  the  receipt of a Superior Proposal.

 

 

5.5 _Filings;  Other Actions_.

 

 

(a) As  promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
Acquiror and  Company shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be
filed with the  SEC  mutually acceptable proxy materials which shall
constitute the proxy  statement/prospectus relating to the matters to be
submitted to Company's  stockholders at the Company Meeting (such proxy
statement/prospectus, and  any  amendments or supplements thereto, the
"Proxy Statement/Prospectus") and  Acquiror shall prepare and file with the
SEC a registration statement on  Form  S-4 (of which the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall be a part) with respect  to  the issuance of
Acquiror Common Stock in the Merger (such Form S-4, and any  amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Form S-4"). Each of Acquiror and Company  shall use
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement/Prospectus  cleared  by
the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC and to keep the 
Form  S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and
the  transactions contemplated thereby. Acquiror and Company shall, as
promptly  as  practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party
copies of any  written  comments and advise the other party of any oral
comments with respect to  the  Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4
received from the SEC. Each party  shall  cooperate and provide the other
party with a reasonable opportunity to review  and comment on any amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus  and  the Form S-4 prior to
filing such with the SEC, and each party will provide  the  other party with
a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Acquiror shall  use its
reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be taken under  any
applicable state securities laws in connection with the Merger and each 
party shall furnish all information concerning it and the others to its
capital  stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action.  Each  party will advise the other party, promptly after it receives
notice thereof,  of  the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the
issuance of any stop  order,  the suspension of the qualification of the
Acquiror Common stock issuable  in  connection with the Merger for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction, or any  request by the SEC for amendment of the

(b) If  at any  time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
either of the  parties, or their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be  discovered by either party which should be set forth in
an amendment or  supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that  such  documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to  state  any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which  discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and,  to  the
extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment  or 
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC 
and  disseminated to the stockholders of Company.

 

 

(c) Each  of  Acquiror and Company agrees to cooperate with the other and,
subject to the  terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, use
reasonable best efforts  to  promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation (including making all  required initial filings in connection
with the Regulatory Approvals within  45  days of the date of this
Agreement), to effect all necessary applications,  notices, petitions,
filings and other documents, and to obtain as promptly  as  practicable all
necessary permits, consents, orders, approvals and  authorizations of, or any
exemption by, all third parties and Governmental  Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement,
including the Regulatory Approvals. Each of Acquiror and  Company  shall
have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable  each 
will consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable laws
relating  to  the exchange of information, with respect to all the material
information  relating to the other party, and any of their respective
subsidiaries, which  appears in any material filing made with, or written
materials submitted  to, any  third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of  the  parties hereto agrees to act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each  party hereto agrees that it
will consult with the other party hereto with  respect to the obtaining of
all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations  of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to  consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party  will  keep the other party
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion  of  the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Each  of  Acquiror and Company agree, upon request, to furnish the other
with all  information concerning itself, its subsidiaries, directors,
officers and  stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable  in connection with the Proxy Statement or any other
statement, filing, notice  or  application made by or on behalf of such
other party or any of its subsidiaries  to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

5.6 _Information  Supplied_.  Each of  Company and Acquiror agrees, as to
itself and its subsidiaries, that none  of the  information supplied or to
be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation  by  reference in the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto,  at the  date of mailing
to stockholders and at the time of the Company Meeting, will  contain any
statement which, in light of the circumstances under which such  statement is
made, will be false or misleading with respect to any material  fact, or will
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make  the  statements
therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement  in any
earlier statement in the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement 
thereto. Each of Company and Acquiror further agrees that if it shall become 
aware prior to the Effective Time of any information furnished by it that 
would  cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement to be false or
misleading  with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact  necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly  inform the other party thereof and to take the
necessary steps to correct  the  Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement shall
not be filed, and, prior to the  termination of this Agreement, no amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement  shall be filed, by Acquiror or Company,
without consultation with the other  party and its counsel.

 

 

5.7 _Access  and Investigations_.  e)  Upon  reasonable notice, each party
agrees to (and shall cause each of its  subsidiaries and affiliates to)
afford the other party and its Representatives  access, during normal
business hours throughout the period until the Closing  Date, to its
properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period,  shall (and
shall cause each of its subsidiaries and affiliates to) furnish  promptly to
the other party all material information concerning its business,  properties
and personnel as may reasonably be requested. Neither party nor  any  of its
subsidiaries or affiliates shall be required to provide access to  or to 
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice  the rights of such party's (including its subsidiaries and
affiliates)  customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in  possession or control of such information or contravene any
law, rule,  regulation, order, judgment or decree or any binding agreement
entered into  prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will
make appropriate  substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which restrictions  of  the preceding sentence apply.

 

 

(b) Each  party agrees, and will cause its respective subsidiaries,
affiliates and  Representatives not to use any information obtained from the
other party  (or  such other party's subsidiaries, affiliates or
Representatives), pursuant to  this Section 5.7 or otherwise, for any purpose
unrelated to the consummation  of  the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party will keep, and  will  cause its subsidiaries,
affiliates and Representatives to keep, all information  and documents
obtained from the other party pursuant to this Section 5.7  or  during the
investigation leading up to the execution of this Agreement  confidential
unless such information (i) becomes available to such party  from  other
sources not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality  obligation,
or (ii) is or becomes readily ascertainable from publicly available 
information or trade sources (other than as a result of a breach of this 
Agreement by such party or its subsidiaries, affiliates or Representatives). 
In  the event that this Agreement is terminated or the transactions
contemplated  by  this Agreement shall otherwise fail to be consummated,
each party shall promptly  cause all copies of documents or extracts thereof
containing information  and  data as to another party hereto to be returned
to the party which furnished  the  same, or (at such party's option) confirm
in writing to such party that it has  completely destroyed all such copies,
documents, extracts, information and  data.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) No  investigation by either of the parties or their respective
Representatives  shall  affect the representations and warranties of the
other set forth herein or  preclude reliance thereon.

 

 

5.8 _Certain  Modifications; Restructuring Charges_.  Company  and Acquiror
agree to consult with respect to their loan, litigation and  real  estate
valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and  levels
of reserves) and Company shall make such modifications or changes  to its 
policies and practices, if any, and at such date prior to the Effective
Time,  as  Acquiror shall reasonably request; provided that (a) such
modifications or  changes comply with generally accepted accounting
principles and regulatory  requirements and guidelines and (b) the conditions
specified in Sections  6.1(a)  and (b) have been satisfied or waived.
Company and Acquiror shall also consult  with respect to the character,
amount and timing of restructuring charges  to be  taken by each of them in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby  and shall take such
charges in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles, as
Acquiror shall reasonably request. No party's representations,  warranties
and covenants contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be  untrue or
breached in any respect for any purpose as a consequence of any 
modifications or changes to such policies and practices which may be
undertaken  on account of this Section 5.8.

 

 

5.9 _Takeover  Laws_.  If any  Takeover Law may become, or may purport to
be, applicable to this Agreement,  the  Voting Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, each  of  Acquiror and Company
and the members of their respective Boards of Directors  will grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary (other than  any  action
requiring the approval of its stockholders other than as contemplated  by 
Section 5.4) so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and 
the  Voting Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms  contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize  the  effects of any Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Voting
Agreements or any  of  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

5.10 _Benefit  Plans_.  f)  From and  after the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall provide individuals who are employees  of the Company at the Effective
Time and who continue as employees of Acquiror  or any of its subsidiaries
("Continuing Employees") with benefits under employee  benefit plans (other
than stock options and other equity-based plans)  substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided to similarly  situated employees of Acquiror
and its subsidiaries, as the case may be.  Acquiror shall cause each employee
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement  ("Acquiror Benefit Plan") in
which employees of Company or its subsidiaries are  eligible to participate
to take into account for purposes of eligibility  and  vesting (but not
benefit accrual under Pension Plans or retiree medical plans)  thereunder the
service of such employees with Company or its subsidiaries  (including
service with acquired entities for which Company and its subsidiaries  have
given service credit) to the same extent as such service was credited  for 
such purpose by Company or its subsidiaries under a comparable Company
Benefit  Plan (including for the avoidance of doubt the Severance Plan (as
defined  below)), _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  employee shall be
eligible to participate, at any one time, in more than  one  plan providing
for severance benefits. At and after the Effective Time, to  the  extent
permitted by law, until Continuing Employees commence participation  in 
comparable Acquiror Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms of each Plan, 
Acquiror and its subsidiaries shall continue to maintain each Company
Benefit  Plan and Continuing Employees shall continue to participate in each
such  Company  Benefit Plan. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of
Acquiror to amend  or  terminate any of the Benefit Plans in accordance with
their terms at any  time.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Acquiror  shall cause each Acquiror Benefit Plan providing medical or
dental benefits  to  Continuing Employees to (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations relating  to any conditions that were covered under the
applicable medical or dental  plans  of Company or its subsidiaries, (ii)
for purposes of satisfying all deductible,  coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements, take into account any  eligible expenses incurred by
Continuing Employees or their covered dependents  during the portion of the
plan year ending on the date on which such Continuing  Employees commence
participation in a comparable Acquiror Benefit Plan, as  if  such amounts
had been paid under such Acquiror Benefit Plan and (iii) waive  any  waiting
period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would 
otherwise be applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent such 
Continuing Employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under  a  comparable Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) Company  shall cooperate in providing information reasonably requested by
Acquiror  that  is necessary for Acquiror to prepare and distribute notices
that Acquiror  may  desire to provide prior to the Effective Time under the
Workers Adjustment  and  Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (WARN Act).

 

 

(d) Acquiror  shall assume and honor, or pay out, the accrued but unused
vacation and sick  time of Continuing Employees.

 

 

(e) Acquiror  shall assume and honor the U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc. Severance
Plan (the "Severance Plan") for a period of twelve months following the
Effective Time,  provided that, prior to Closing, and in any case prior to
the Company Meeting,  Company has adopted the amendment to the Severance Plan
set forth in  _Section  5.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_.

 

 

(f) Concurrently  with the execution of this Agreement, Company, Acquiror and
each of Thomas  E.  Hales, Raymond J. Crotty and Thomas M. Buonaiuto shall
enter into an agreement  substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit 
5.10(f) to the Company Disclosure Letter_ ,  which  shall govern the
settlement of their respective employment agreements or  termination pay
arrangement.

5.11 _Indemnification  and Insurance_.

 

 

(a) Following  the Effective Time, Acquiror agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless (including  the advancement of expenses as incurred) each present
and former director  and  officer of Company and its subsidiaries (each, an
"Indemnified Party") following  the Effective Time, against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable  attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities  incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or  investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative,  arising  out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the  Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective  Time, to the extent such
Indemnified Party would have been indemnified as  a  director or officer of
Company or any of its subsidiaries under the DGCL  and  Company's articles
of incorporation and by-laws.

 

 

(b) Acquiror  shall cause the Persons covered by the directors' and officers'
liability policy  currently maintained by Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time to  be  covered for a period of six years after the Effective
Time by Company's  directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
(provided that Acquiror may  substitute policies providing comparable or
better coverage than such policy)  with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time which  were committed by such officers
and directors in their capacity as such;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that
in  no event shall Acquiror be required to expend more than 200% per year
of  the  amount currently expended by Company per year for coverage as of
the date  hereof  under its directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy (the "Maximum  Amount") to maintain or procure insurance coverage
pursuant hereto, and  _provided_ _further_   that, if  notwithstanding the
use of reasonable best efforts to do so Acquiror is unable  to maintain or
obtain the insurance called for by this Section 5.11(b), Acquiror  shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the Maximum Amount; 
_provided_ _further_   that  such Persons may be required to make reasonable
application and provide  reasonable and customary representations and
warranties to Acquiror's insurance  carrier for the purpose of obtaining such
insurance, comparable in nature  and  scope to the applications,
representations and warranties required of persons  who are officers and
directors of Acquiror as of the date hereof.

 

 

(c) Any  Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
5.11(a),  upon  learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described  above, shall promptly notify Acquiror thereof;
provided that the failure  so to  notify shall not affect the obligations of
Acquiror under Section 5.11(a)  unless  and to the extent that Acquiror is
prejudiced as a result of such  failure.

 

 

(d) If  Acquiror or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges  into  any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity
of such  consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its
assets  to  any other entity, then and in each case, Acquiror will cause
proper provision  to  be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror
will assume the  obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

 

 

(e) The  provisions of this Section 5.11 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and  shall  be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and  representatives.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.12 _Publicity_.  The  initial press release relating hereto will be a
joint press release and  thereafter, except as otherwise required by law or
the applicable rules of  the  NYSE or any other self-regulatory
organization, Company and Acquiror shall  coordinate with each other prior to
issuing any press releases or otherwise  making public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated  hereby.

 

 

5.13 _Reasonable  Best Efforts; Additional Agreements_.  Subject  to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Acquiror and Company  agrees
to cooperate fully with each other and to use reasonable best efforts  to 
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, 
all  things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective,
at  the  time and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger,
including  using reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or
restraining  order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the
parties to  consummate the Merger (it being understood that any amendments or
supplements  to  the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or a
resolicitation of proxies  as  a result of a transaction by Acquiror or its
subsidiaries shall not violate  this  covenant).

 

 

5.14 _Notification  of Certain Matters_.  Each of  Acquiror and Company
will give prompt notice to the other (and subsequently  keep  the other
party informed on a current basis) upon its becoming aware of the  occurrence
or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that (a) is  reasonably
likely to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to  it,  or (b)
would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its  representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein; provided  that any
failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect  to 
any breach shall not be deemed to constitute the failure of any condition 
set  forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) or Section 6.3(a) or (b) to be
satisfied,  or to  give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(b),  unless the underlying breach would independently
result in a failure of the  conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) or
Section 6.3(a) or (b), as  the  case may be, to be satisfied or give rise to
such termination  right.

 

 

5.15 _Expenses_.  Each of  the parties shall bear and pay all costs and

to most effectively compensate  and  retain Company Insiders (as defined
below) in connection with the Merger,  both  prior to and after the
Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders  not  be subject to a
risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act  to the  fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion  of 
(i) shares of Company Common Stock into the right to receive cash and/or 
shares  of Acquiror Common Stock and (ii) Company Options into the right to
receive  options to purchase Acquiror Common Stock or cash, as applicable, in
the  Merger,  and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the
provisions of  this  Section 5.16. Provided that Company delivers to
Acquiror the Company Section  16  Information (as defined below) in a timely
fashion prior to the Effective  Time,  the Board of Directors of Acquiror,
or a committee of non-employee directors  thereof (as such term is defined
for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the  Exchange Act), shall reasonably
promptly thereafter and in any event prior  to  the Effective Time adopt a
resolution providing in substance that the receipt  by  the Company Insiders
(as defined below) of cash, shares of Acquiror Common  Stock  and/or options
to purchase Acquiror Common Stock in exchange for shares of  Company Common
Stock and Company Options, in each case pursuant to the  transactions
contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed  in  the
Company Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability 
pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted  by applicable law. "Company Section 16 Information" shall mean
information  accurate in all material respects regarding the Company
Insiders, the number  of  shares of Company Common Stock held by each such
Company Insider and expected  to  be exchanged for the right to receive cash
and/or shares of Acquiror Common  Stock in the Merger, and the number and
description of Company Options held  by  each such Company Insider and
expected to be converted into an option to  purchase shares of Acquiror
Common Stock or cash, as applicable, in connection  with the Merger. "Company
Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of  Company who are subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of  the  Exchange Act and who
are listed in the Company Section 16  Information.

5.17 _Environmental  Assessments_.  Upon  reasonable notice, Company shall
cooperate with and grant access to an  environmental consulting firm selected

(a) ASTM  1527  Phase I environmental assessments ("Phase I Assessments");
and

estimate by the environmental consulting  firm preparing such Environmental
Assessment of the costs of investigation,  monitoring, personal injury,
property damage, clean up, remediation, penalties,  fines or other
liabilities, as the case may be, relating to the Recognized  Environmental
Condition(s) or other conditions which are the subject of the  Phase II
Assessment.

 

 

Acquiror  shall bear and pay the environmental consulting firm's fees and
expenses. Within  15 days after the date hereof, Acquiror shall engage an
environmental consultant  reasonably acceptable to Company to perform the
Phase I Assessments. Acquiror  shall use reasonable efforts to cause its
environmental consultant to complete  and provide Acquiror with its written
Phase I Assessment(s) within 45 days  after  such consultant is retained.
Promptly following the receipt of all Phase  I  Assessments (but not later
than 15 days thereafter), Acquiror shall order  all  applicable Phase II
Assessments. Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts  to  have all
Environmental Assessments completed within 90 days of the date of  this 
Agreement.

 

 

5.18 _Registration  and Merger Consideration_.  At or  prior to the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall take all corporate action necessary  to

purposes of Rule 145 under the  Securities Act) of Company to deliver to
Acquiror, as soon as practicable  after  the date of this Agreement, a
written agreement in the form of _Exhibit  B_   hereto.

 

 

5.20 _Stock  Exchange Listing_.  Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the shares of Acquiror  Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to
be approved for listing on the  NYSE,  subject to official notice of
issuance, as of the Effective Time.

(d) _Federal  Income Tax Opinion_.  Acquiror shall have received an opinion

substantially to the effect that, on the basis  of  facts, representations
and assumptions set forth in such opinion:

 

 

(i) The  Merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a

Agreement and as of the Effective Time as though made  at and  as of the
Effective Time (except that representations and warranties that  by  their
terms speak specifically as of the date of this Agreement or some other  date
shall be, giving effect to Sections 4.1 and 4.2, true and correct as  of 
such date) and Company shall have received two certificates, dated the
Closing  Date, signed on behalf of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub by the Chief

the period during which such holder  held such Company Common Stock.

 

 

In  rendering such opinion, Thacher Proffitt and Wood llp  may  require and
reply upon representations and covenants, including those contained  in
certificates of officers of Acquiror and others, reasonably satisfactory 
in  form and substance to such counsel.

 

 

ARTICLE  VII

 

 

TERMINATION

 

 

7.1 _Termination_.  This  Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger
abandoned, prior to the Effective  Time, either before or after its approval
by the stockholders of  Company:

 

 

(a) by  the  mutual consent of Acquiror and Company, if the board of
directors of each  so  determines by vote of a majority of the members of
its entire  board;

 

 

(b) by  Acquiror or Company, if its board of directors so determines by vote
of a  majority of the members of its entire board, in the event of a breach
by  the  other party hereto of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement  contained herein which is not cured or not curable within 45 days
after written  notice of such breach is given to the party committing such
breach by the  other  party and which breach, individually or in the
aggregate with other such  breaches, would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 6.2(a) and (b),  in the  case of breaches by Company, or Section
6.3(a) and (b), in the case of breaches  by Acquiror, not to be satisfied;

 

 

(c) by  Acquiror or Company by written notice to the other if either (i) any
approval,  consent or waiver of a Governmental Entity required to permit
consummation  of  the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been
denied in writing or  (ii)  any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final,  unappealable order enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

 

 

(d) by  Acquiror or Company, if its board of directors so determines by vote
of a  majority of the members of its entire board, in the event that the
Merger  is not  consummated by January 31, 2008 (the "Termination Date"),
unless the failure to  so consummate by such time is due to the breach of any
representation, warranty  or covenant contained in this Agreement by the
party seeking to  terminate;

 

 

(e) by  the  Board of Directors of Acquiror in the event that (i) the Board
of Directors  of  Company does not continue to recommend that its
stockholders adopt this  Agreement, withdraws such recommendation or modifies
or changes such  recommendation in a manner adverse to the interests of
Acquiror, (ii) Company  has failed to substantially comply with its
obligations under Section 5.3  or 5.4  or (iii) the Board of Directors of
Company has recommended or endorsed an  Acquisition Proposal;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) by  Company at any time during the three business-day period following
the Acquiror  Ratio Determination Date (as defined below), if:

 

 

(i) the  Ending Price (as defined below) shall be less than the product of
0.85 and  the  Starting Price (as defined below); and

 

 

(ii) (A)  the  number obtained by dividing the Ending Price by the Starting
Price (such  number  being referred to herein as the "Acquiror Ratio") shall
be less than (B) the  number obtained by dividing the Index Price on the
Acquiror Ratio Determination  Date by the Index Price on the Starting Date
and subtracting 0.15 from such  quotient (such number being referred to
herein as the "Index Ratio") subject to  the following. If Company elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant  to  the immediately preceding
sentence, it shall give prompt written notice to  Acquiror; provided that
such notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn  at  any time within
the aforementioned three business-day period. During the  three  business-
day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Acquiror  shall  have
the option of increasing the Designated Ratio and/or Per Share Cash 
Consideration in a manner such that the conditions set forth in either
clause  (i) or (ii) above shall be deemed not to exist. For purposes hereof,
the  condition set forth in clause (i) above shall be deemed not to exist if
the  Designated Ratio and/or Per Share Cash Consideration is adjusted so
that  the  aggregate value of the Merger Consideration after such increase
is not less  than  the aggregate value of the Merger Consideration that
would have been in effect  if the condition set forth in clause (i) above did
not exist. For purposes  hereof, the condition set forth in clause (ii) above
shall be deemed not  to  exist if the aggregate value of the Merger
Consideration is increased so  that  the aggregate value of the Merger
Consideration after such increase is not  less  than the aggregate value of
the Merger Consideration that would have been  in  effect if the condition
set forth in clause (ii) above did not exist. If  Acquiror makes this
election, within such three business-day period, it shall  give prompt
written notice to Company of such election and the revised  Designated Ratio
and/or Designated Amount, whereupon no termination shall  have  occurred
pursuant to this Section 7.1(f) and this Agreement shall remain  in  effect
in accordance with its terms (except as the Designated Ratio and/or 
Designated Amount shall have been so modified).

 

 

(iii) For  purposes of this Section 7.1(f), the following terms shall have
the meanings  indicated:

46

such calendar  day is not an NYSE trading day, then the NYSE trading day
immediately preceding  such calendar day.

If  Acquiror declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification, 
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar 
transaction between the Starting Date and the Determination Date, the prices 
for  Acquiror Common Stock shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes
of  applying this Section 7.1(f).

 

 

(g) By  Acquiror if any Phase II Assessment indicates the existence of any
condition  or  matter with respect to which it is reasonably likely that the
cost set forth  in  the Phase II Assessment(s) of investigation, monitoring,
personal injury,  property damage, clean up, remediation, penalties, fines or
other liabilities  relating to the Recognized Environmental Condition(s)
which resulted in the  Phase II Assessment would exceed $1,000,000 in the
case of any one parcel  of  Owned Real Property or $3,000,000 in the case of
all Owned Real Property  and the  existence of such condition or matter has
not been cured by Company within  45  days after written notice of such
condition or matter is given to Company  by  Acquiror.

 

 

7.2 _Fee_.  As a  condition of Acquiror's willingness, and in order to
induce Acquiror to enter  into this Agreement, and to reimburse Acquiror for
incurring the costs and  expenses related to entering into this Agreement and
consummating the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Company hereby
agrees to pay  Acquiror, and Acquiror shall be entitled to payment of, a fee

below:

(ii) Company  enters into a definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or  the  consummation of an Acquisition Proposal involving Company

pursuant to Section  7.1(b) because of a breach (other than a non-volitional
breach of a  representation or warranty) by Company after an Acquisition
Proposal has  been  publicly announced or otherwise made known to Company.

 

 

7.3 _Effect  of Termination and Abandonment_.  In the  event of termination
of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger  pursuant to Section 7.1,
(a) no party to this Agreement shall have any liability  or further
obligation to any other party hereunder; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
termination will not relieve a breaching party from liability for any
willful  breach giving rise to such termination and (b) this Agreement shall
forthwith  be  void and of no further legal effect, other than the
provisions of Sections  5.7(b), 5.15 and 7.2, this Section 7.3 and Article
VIII.

this Agreement and the  consummation by it of the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement  has  been duly executed and delivered by the
Stockholder and, assuming this  Agreement  constitutes a valid and binding

of, or require payment under, or require redemption or repurchase  of or
otherwise require the purchase or sale of any securities, or result  in the

ineffective to the extent of such invalidity  or  unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining  terms and provisions of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or  enforceability of any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement in any  other  jurisdiction, and if
any provision of this Agreement is determined to be  so  broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be  only so  broad as
is enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor  legal 
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner 
materially adverse to any party or its stockholders or limited partners. 
Upon  any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in
an  effort  to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to

**FORM  OF AFFILIATE AGREEMENT**

 



 



 

July  __,  2007

 



 

KeyCorp

 

127  Public Square

 

Cleveland,  OH 44114

 



 

Ladies  and Gentlemen:

 



 

I  have  been advised that I might be considered to be an "affiliate" of
U.S.B. Holding  Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation ("USB"), for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and  (d) of Rule 145 of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") under the  Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act").

 



 

KeyCorp  ("Acquiror"), KYCA Corporation and USB have entered into an
Agreement and Plan  of Merger, dated as of July __, 2007 (the "Agreement").
Upon consummation of the  merger contemplated by the Agreement (the
"Merger"), I may receive shares of  common stock of Acquiror ("Acquiror
Common Stock") in exchange for my shares of  common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of USB ("USB Common Stock"). This  agreement is hereinafter referred
to as the "Letter Agreement."

 



 

I  represent and warrant to, and agree with, Acquiror as follows:

 



 

1. I  have  read this Letter Agreement and the Agreement and have discussed their  requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,  pledge,  transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of Acquiror Common Stock that  I may  receive pursuant to the Merger, to the extent I felt necessary, with  my counsel  or counsel for USB.

 



 

2. I  have  been advised that any issuance of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to  me pursuant  to the Merger will be registered with the SEC. I have also been advised,  however, that, because I may be an "affiliate" of USB at the time the Merger  will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of USB and my disposition  of  such shares has not been registered under the Securities Act, I must  hold such  shares indefinitely unless (i) the disposition of such shares is subject  to an  effective registration statement and to the availability of a prospectus  under  the Securities Act, (ii) the disposition of such shares is made in  conformity  with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act (as such  rule may be  amended from time to time) or (iii) in an opinion of counsel, in form  and  substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror, the disposition of such  shares is  otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act.

 



 

3. I  understand that the Acquiror is under no obligation to register the  sale,  transfer or other disposition of shares of Acquiror Common Stock by  me or on my  behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary  in order  to make compliance with an exemption from such registration  available.

 



 

4. I  understand and agree that stop transfer instructions will be given  to the  transfer agent of Acquiror with respect to the shares of Acquiror Common  Stock I  receive pursuant to the Merger and that there will be placed on the  certificate  representing such shares, or any certificates delivered in substitution  therefor, a legend stating in substance:

 



 

"The  shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction 
to which  Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares
represented  by  this certificate may only be transferred in accordance with
the terms  of a  letter agreement between the registered holder hereof and
KeyCorp,  a copy of  which is on file at the principal offices of KeyCorp."

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5. Acquiror  reserves the right to put an appropriate legend on the certificate  issued to my  transferee unless (i) a transfer of my shares of the Acquiror Common  Stock is a  sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) or made  pursuant to  any effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or (ii)  I shall  have delivered to Acquiror an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory  to  Acquiror to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes  of the  Securities Act.

 



 

6. I  recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i)  my spouse,  (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse's occupying my home, (iii) any trust or  estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial  interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any  similar  capacity and (iv) any corporation or other organization in which I,  my spouse  and any such relative collectively own at least 10% of any class of  equity  securities or of the equity interest. It is understood that this Letter  Agreement shall be binding upon and enforceable against my administrators,  executors, representatives, heirs, legatees and devisees, and any pledge  holding  securities restricted pursuant to the Letter Agreement.

 



 

7. I  further  recognize that in the event I become a director or officer of Acquiror  upon  consummation of the Merger, any sale of Acquiror Common Stock by me  may subject  me to liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

8. Without  limiting or abrogating the agreements that I have made as set forth  above,  execution of this Letter Agreement should not be construed as an admission  on my  part that I am an "affiliate" of USB as described in the first paragraph of this  Letter Agreement or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object  to any claim  that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this Letter  Agreement.

 



 

It  is  understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate
and  be of no  further force and effect if the Agreement is terminated in
accordance  with its  terms. It is also understood and agreed that this
Letter Agreement  shall  terminate and be of no further force and effect and
the stop transfer  instructions set forth above shall be lifted forthwith
upon the delivery  by the  undersigned to Acquiror of an opinion of counsel
in form and substance  reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror, or other evidence
reasonably satisfactory  to Acquiror, to the effect that a transfer of my
shares of Acquiror  Common Stock  will not violate the Securities Act or any
of the rules and regulations  of the  SEC thereunder. In addition, it is
understood and agreed that the legend  set  forth in Paragraph 4 above shall
be removed forthwith from the certificate  or  certificates representing my
shares of Acquiror Common Stock upon (i)  expiration  of the restrictive
period set forth in Rule 145(d)(2), so long as Acquiror  is  then in
compliance with SEC Rule 144(c), or the restrictive period  set forth in 
Rule 145(d)(3) or (ii) if Acquiror shall have received an opinion of 
counsel, in  form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror, or other
evidence  satisfactory to Acquiror that a transfer of my shares of the
Acquiror  Common  Stock represented by such certificate or certificates will
be a sale  made in  conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d), made
pursuant to an  effective  registration statement under the Securities Act
or made pursuant to  an exemption  from registration under the Securities
Act.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  Letter Agreement shall be binding on my heirs, legal representatives 
and  successors.

 



 

Very  truly yours,
