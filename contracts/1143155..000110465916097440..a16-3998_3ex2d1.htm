any applicable accelerated vesting), a number of shares of HRB Common Stock

price per share under such Xenith Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio

contemplated by this Agreement shall be cancelled and converted automatically
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of
Xenith Common Stock underlying such Xenith Restricted Stock Award and, unless
the holder of the Xenith Restricted Stock Award makes a cash payment to Xenith
at or before the Effective Time for applicable tax withholdings, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of a Xenith Restricted Stock Award shall be
reduced by applicable tax withholdings as described in Section 1.6(d).

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Xenith Restricted Stock Award that does not
by its terms become vested at the Effective Time or by reason of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into a HRB restricted stock award with the same terms
and conditions (including vesting provisions) as were applicable to such
Xenith Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
relating to the number of shares of HRB Common Stock equal to the product of
(a) the Exchange Ratio, multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Xenith
Common Stock subject to such Xenith Restricted Stock Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (rounding any resultant fractional share to the
nearest whole number of shares).

(i) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
shares of Xenith Common Stock granted by Xenith that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Xenith Restricted Stock Unit
Award_ ") and becomes vested and/or payable by its terms at the Effective Time
or by reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Xenith Common
Stock underlying such Xenith Restricted Stock Unit Award and, unless the

not by its terms become vested at the Effective Time or by reason of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or that is
vested immediately prior to the Effective Time or by reason of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and does not
by its terms become payable at the Effective Time, shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into a HRB restricted stock unit award with the same terms and conditions
(including vesting and payment provisions) as were applicable to such Xenith
Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, relating
to the number of shares of HRB Common Stock equal to the product of (a) the
Exchange Ratio, multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Xenith Common Stock
subject to such Xenith Restricted Stock Unit Award as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (rounding any resultant fractional share to the nearest
whole number of shares).

 



 

(d) If the applicable tax withholdings are not paid to Xenith in cash as
provided in Section 1.6(b)(i) or Section 1.6(c)(i), the number of shares of

Stock equal to the number of shares of Xenith Common Stock subject to such
Xenith Warrant immediately before the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio (rounding any resultant fractional share down to the nearest
whole share) at a price per share of HRB Common Stock equal to the price per
share under such Xenith Warrant divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounding any
resultant fractional cent up to the nearest cent) (each, as so adjusted, a "
_Xenith Adjusted Warrant_ ").

ARTICLE II

 



 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 



 

2.1 _HRB to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time, HRB
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent
designated by HRB and reasonably acceptable to Xenith (the " _Exchange Agent_
"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance
with this Article II, certificates or, at HRBs option, evidence of shares in
book entry form (collectively, referred to herein as " _certificates_ "),
representing the shares of HRB Common Stock, and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of HRB Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), to be issued pursuant to
Sections 1.4 and 1.6 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Xenith Common Stock.

 



 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, HRB shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of
Xenith Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive HRB Common Stock
pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole shares of HRB
Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of
Xenith Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have
been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as
any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon
proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable,
(i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of HRB Common Stock
to which such holder of Xenith Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check representing the
amount of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (B) any dividends or
distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
this Section 2.2, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be

 



      
 

 



 

cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration,
dividends or distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to
holders of Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole
shares of HRB Common Stock which the shares of Xenith Common Stock represented
by such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as
contemplated by this Section 2.2.

 



 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to HRB Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such
holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to the whole shares of HRB Common Stock that the shares
of Xenith Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted
into the right to receive.

 



 

(c) If any certificate representing shares of HRB Common Stock is to be issued
in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered
in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer)
and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing
shares of HRB Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any
other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Xenith of the shares of Xenith Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of HRB Common Stock as provided in this
Article II.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of HRB Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution
with respect to HRB Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of HRB. In lieu
of the issuance of any such fractional share, HRB shall pay to each former
shareholder of Xenith who otherwise would be entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of HRB Common Stock on
the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the " _NASDAQ_ ") as reported by _The Wall
Street Journal_ for the five (5) full trading days ending on the day preceding
the Closing Date (or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
mutually agreed upon by Xenith and HRB) (the " _HRB Share Closing Price_ ") by
(ii) the fraction

 



      
 

 



 

of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
of HRB Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 1.4.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Xenith for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of Xenith who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of the shares of HRB Common Stock, cash
in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
the HRB Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Xenith
Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of HRB, Xenith, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any
other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Xenith Common
Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(g) HRB shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent
to deduct and withhold, from any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares of HRB Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of Xenith Common Stock or Xenith Equity Awards
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by HRB or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate
governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Xenith Common Stock or
Xenith Equity Awards in respect of which the deduction and withholding was
made by HRB or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by HRB, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as HRB may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of HRB Common Stock
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(i) In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no appraisal rights shall
be available to the holders of Xenith Common Stock in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF XENITH

 



 

Except (A) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Xenith to HRB
concurrently herewith (the " _Xenith Disclosure Schedule_ "); _provided_ that
(i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere

 



      
 

 



 

inclusion of an item in the Xenith Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Xenith that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and
(iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article III shall be
deemed to qualify (a) any other section of Article III specifically referenced
or cross-referenced and (b) other sections of Article III to the extent it is
reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific
cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies
to such other sections, or (B) as disclosed in any Xenith Reports filed by
Xenith since December 31, 2014, and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding
risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or
disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer
or any other statements that are similarly nonspecific or cautionary,
predictive or forward-looking in nature), Xenith hereby represents and
warrants to HRB as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) Xenith is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and is a bank holding
company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(" _BHC Act_ "). Xenith has the corporate power and authority to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. Xenith is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Xenith. True and
complete copies of the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
of Xenith (the " _Xenith Articles_ ") and the Amended and Restated By-Laws of
Xenith (the " _Xenith Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by Xenith to HRB.

 



 

(b) Each Subsidiary of Xenith (a " _Xenith Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Xenith and (iii) has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of Xenith to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of
a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit
accounts of each Subsidiary of Xenith that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "
_FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted
by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection
therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of
such insurance are pending or threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the Xenith
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of
Xenith.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means,
with respect to HRB, Xenith or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, prospects, results of operations or condition (financial or
otherwise) of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect
shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date
hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or
applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date
hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in
the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after
the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market
conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and not
specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, or (D) changes
proximately caused by the public disclosure or consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (provided that this exception shall not apply
for purposes of the representations and warranties in Section 3.3(b) or
Section 4.3(b)) or actions expressly required by this Agreement or that are
taken with the express prior written consent of the other party in
contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby; except, with respect to
subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to the extent that the effects of such change are
disproportionately adverse to such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as compared to other companies in the industry in which such party and
its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(d) As used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with
respect to any person, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, bank or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated,
or person of which (i) such first person directly or indirectly owns or
controls at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by
their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or others performing similar functions or (ii) such first person is
or directly or indirectly has the power to appoint a general partner, manager
or managing member or others performing similar functions.

Xenith Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights,

 



      
 

 



 

with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. There are no
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on
any matters on which shareholders of Xenith may vote. No trust preferred or,
except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Xenith Disclosure Schedule,
subordinated debt securities of Xenith are issued or outstanding. Other than
Xenith Stock Options, Xenith Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Xenith Warrants,
in each case, issued prior to the date of this Agreement and set forth in this
Section 3.2(a), there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other
commitments or agreements obligating Xenith to issue, transfer, sell,
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any such securities. There are no
voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect
with respect to the voting or transfer of the Xenith Common Stock or other
equity interests of Xenith, other than the Voting Agreements and as set forth
in Section 3.2(a) of the Xenith Disclosure Schedule. Section 3.2(a) of the
Xenith Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all

the Xenith Equity Awards, no equity-based awards (including any cash awards
where the amount of payment is determined in whole or in part based on the
price of any capital stock of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries) are
outstanding.

 



 

(b) Xenith owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of the
Xenith Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such
shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to bank Subsidiaries,
as provided under 12 U.S.C. § 55 or any comparable provision of applicable
state law) and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching
to the ownership thereof. No Xenith Subsidiary has or is bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares
of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

 



 

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 



 

(a) Xenith has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Xenith. The
Board of Directors of Xenith has determined in its good faith business
judgment that the Merger (including the Plan of Merger), on the terms and

_Requisite Xenith Vote_ "), and the adoption and approval of the Bank Merger
Agreement by the Board of Directors of Xenith Bank and Xenith as its sole
shareholder, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Xenith are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Xenith and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
HRB) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Xenith, enforceable against
Xenith in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such
enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions).

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Xenith nor the
consummation by Xenith of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance

provision of the Xenith Articles or the Xenith Bylaws or (ii) assuming that
the consents and approvals referred to in Section 3.4 are duly obtained, (x)
violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ,

assets of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause
(y) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults that, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Xenith.

approvals of or filings or registrations with any court,

 



      
 

 



 

administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or

connection with (A) the execution and delivery by Xenith of this Agreement or
(B) the consummation by Xenith of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Bank Merger, the HRB Bank Payment and the

timely basis.

 



 

3.5 _Reports_. Xenith and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all

regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any
Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Xenith. Except for normal examinations conducted by
a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of Xenith and its
Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding
or, to the knowledge of Xenith, investigation into the business or operations
of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2012. There (x) is no
unresolved material violation, material criticism, or material exception by
any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries and (y) has
been no formal or informal material inquiry by, or material disagreement or
material dispute with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to the business,
operations, policies or procedures of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries since
January 1, 2012.

 



 

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The financial statements of Xenith and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Xenith Reports (including the related notes,
where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the
books and records of Xenith and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes
in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of Xenith and its
Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates
therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end
audit adjustments normal and not material in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of Xenith and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Since December 31, 2012, no independent public accounting firm
of Xenith has resigned (or informed Xenith that it intends to resign) or been
dismissed as independent public accountants of Xenith as

 



      
 

 



 

a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Xenith on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure.

 



 

(b) Neither Xenith nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of Xenith included in its Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 (including
any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2015, or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in
each case that would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Xenith.

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Xenith and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Xenith or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Xenith. Xenith (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") to ensure that material information
relating to Xenith, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Xenith by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "), and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to Xeniths outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Board of Directors of Xenith (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Xeniths ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Xeniths internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures
were made in writing by management to Xeniths auditors and audit committee.
There is no reason to believe that Xeniths outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2012, (i) neither Xenith nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Xenith, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Xenith or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Xenith or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (ii) no attorney representing Xenith or any of its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by Xenith or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Xenith or any
committee thereof or to the knowledge of Xenith, to any director or officer of
Xenith.

 



 

3.7 _Broker s Fees_. With the exception of the engagement of Macquarie
Capital (USA) Inc. neither Xenith nor any Xenith Subsidiary nor any of their
respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or
finders fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Xenith has disclosed to HRB as of the date
hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the engagement by
Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., related to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereunder.

 



 

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 



 

(a) Since December 31, 2014, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Xenith.

 



 

(b) Since December 31, 2014, Xenith and its Subsidiaries have carried on their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice.

 



 

3.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 



 

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Xenith, neither Xenith nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any, and there are no pending or, to Xeniths knowledge, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against Xenith or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or executive officers
or challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or material regulatory
restriction imposed upon Xenith, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of
Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger,
would apply to the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates).

 



 

3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Each of Xenith and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (including
all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all jurisdictions in
which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are
true, correct, and complete in all material respects. Neither Xenith nor any
of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which
to file any material Tax Return (other than extensions to file Tax Returns
obtained in the ordinary course). All material Taxes of Xenith and its
Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due have been
fully and timely paid. Each of Xenith and its Subsidiaries has withheld and
paid all material Taxes required to have been

 



      
 

 



 

withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or other third party. Neither
Xenith nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any material Tax that remains in effect. The
federal income Tax Returns of Xenith and its Subsidiaries for all years to and
including 2008 have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_
") or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for
assessment under applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers,
has expired. Neither Xenith nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice of assessment or proposed assessment in connection with any material
amount of Taxes, and there are no threatened in writing or pending disputes,
claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any material Tax
of Xenith and its Subsidiaries or the assets of Xenith and its Subsidiaries.
Xenith has made available to HRB true and complete copies of any private
letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain recognition agreements with
respect to Taxes requested or executed in the last six (6) years. Neither
Xenith nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax
sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than
such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among Xenith and its
Subsidiaries). Neither Xenith nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which was Xenith) or (B) has any
liability for the Taxes of any person (other than Xenith or any of its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise. Neither Xenith nor any of its Subsidiaries has been,
within the past two (2) years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of
related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of
which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a
distribution of stock intending to qualify for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code. Neither Xenith nor any of its Subsidiaries has
participated in a "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation section 1.6011-4(b)(1). At no time during the past five (5) years
has Xenith been a United States real property holding corporation within the
meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

3.11 _Employees_.

 



 

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Xenith Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
correct list of each material Xenith Benefit Plan. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Xenith Benefit Plan_ " means each employee benefit plan (as
defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee

 



      
 

 



 

Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), whether or
not subject to ERISA, and each bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted
stock, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plan, program or
arrangement, and each retention, bonus, employment, termination, severance
plan, program or arrangement or other contract or agreement (i) to or with
respect to which Xenith or any Subsidiary or any trade or business of Xenith
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not incorporated, all of which together
with Xenith would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section
4001 of ERISA (a " _Xenith ERISA Affiliate_ "), is a party or has or, would
reasonably be expected to have, any current or future obligation or (ii) that
is maintained, contributed to or sponsored by Xenith or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Xenith ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of any current or
former employee, officer, director or independent contractor of Xenith or any
of its Subsidiaries or any Xenith ERISA Affiliate.

each material Xenith Benefit Plan and, with respect to each such Xenith
Benefit Plan, the following related documents: (i) all summary plan
descriptions, amendments, modifications or material supplements, (ii) the most
recent annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed with the IRS, (iii) the most
recently received IRS determination letter, if any, and (iv) the most recently
prepared actuarial report (if applicable).

 



 

(c) Each Xenith Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither Xenith nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective action or make a
filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, Department of Labor
or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Xenith Benefit Plan, and
neither Xenith nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan
defect that would qualify for correction under any such program.

 



 

(d) Section 3.11(d) of the Xenith Disclosure Schedule identifies each Xenith
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(each, a " _Xenith Qualified Plan_ "). The IRS has issued a favorable
determination letter or opinion letter with respect to each Xenith Qualified
Plan and the related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor has
revocation been threatened), and, to the knowledge of Xenith, there are no
existing circumstances and no events have occurred that could adversely affect
the qualified status of any Xenith Qualified Plan or the related trust or
increase the costs relating thereto. No trust funding any Xenith Benefit Plan
is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 



 

(e) Each Xenith Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any award thereunder,
in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has (i) since
January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material respects, in
good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1 and
(ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects, in documentary and
operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(f) None of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries nor any Xenith ERISA Affiliate
has, at any time during the last six (6) years, sponsored, maintained or
contributed to or

 



      
 

 



 

been obligated to contribute to (i) any plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code, (ii) any plan
that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or (iii) any plan that has two (2) or more
contributing sponsors at least two (2) of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "),
and none of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries nor any Xenith ERISA Affiliate
has incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan
as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in
Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan.

 



 

(g) Neither Xenith nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or has
any obligation with respect to, any employee benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health
or medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees
or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of
the Code.

 



 

(h) All contributions required to be made to any Xenith Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
Xenith Benefit Plan, for any period through the date hereof, have been timely
made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or
before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of
Xenith.

 



 

(i) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to Xeniths knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that
may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Xenith Benefit
Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Xenith
Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Xenith
Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the
Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any
participant in a Xenith Benefit Plan, or any other party.

 



 

(j) None of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries nor any Xenith ERISA Affiliate
nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA),
which could subject any of the Xenith Benefit Plans or their related trusts,
Xenith, any of its Subsidiaries, any Xenith ERISA Affiliate or any person that
Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any
material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502
of ERISA.

 



 

(k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery
of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to
any employee, officer, director or other service provider of Xenith or any of
its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of Xenith or any of
its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets
from any Xenith Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, no amount

 



      
 

 



 

paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by
Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither Xenith nor
any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a rabbi trust or similar
funding vehicle, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
cause or require Xenith or any of its affiliates to establish or make any
contribution to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle.

 



 

(l) No Xenith Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes
under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise. Xenith has made
available to HRB true, correct and complete copies of Section 280G
calculations (whether or not final) with respect to any individual who is
party to an employment agreement or change of control severance agreement
listed in Section 3.14(a)(i) of the Xenith Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(m) There are no pending or, to Xeniths knowledge, threatened material labor
grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against Xenith
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor disputes
against Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Xenith nor any of its
Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any collective bargaining or similar
agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices agreed to
with any labor organization or employee association applicable to employees of
Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Xenith, there are
no organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking to represent any
employees of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries. Xenith and its Subsidiaries
have complied in all material respects with all Laws regarding employment and
employment practices (including anti-discrimination) and terms and conditions
of employment and wages and hours (including classification of employees and
equitable pay practices), and no claims relating to non-compliance with the
foregoing are pending or, to Xeniths knowledge, threatened.

 



 

3.12 _SEC Reports_. Xenith has previously made available to HRB (including by
making certain items publicly available on EDGAR) an accurate and complete
copy of each (a) registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and
proxy statement filed with or furnished to the SEC since December 31, 2012 by
Xenith pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), or the Exchange Act (the " _Xenith Reports_ ") and (b) communication
mailed by Xenith to its shareholders since December 31, 2012 and prior to the
date hereof, and no such Xenith Report or communication, as of the date
thereof (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on
the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings,
respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, except that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but
before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of
an earlier date. Since December 31, 2012, as of their respective dates, all
Xenith Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in
all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto. No executive officer of Xenith has failed in any respect to
make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of
the Xenith Reports.

 



       
 

 



 

3.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Xenith and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2012, held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where neither the
cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license,
franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or
assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

(i) Each Trust has issued and sold preferred securities and common securities
under a Declaration of Trust (each a " _Trust Agreement_ "), and HRB, as
successor, has issued to each Trust junior subordinated deferrable interest
debentures or notes (" _Securities_ "), under an Indenture (each Trusts

transacts and proposes to transact and to enter into and perform its
obligations under the Operative Documents.

 



 

(iii) The preferred securities and the common securities issued by each Trust
have been duly authorized by the relevant Trust Agreement, have been validly
issued and represent undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the
Trust. None of the preferred securities or the common securities is subject to
preemptive or other similar rights. All of the outstanding common securities

(except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer or conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to
general equitable principles, including good faith, commercial reasonableness,
forthright negotiation and fair dealing).

 



 

4.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 



 

(a) HRB has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of HRB. The
Board of Directors of HRB has determined in its good faith business judgment
that the Merger (including the Plan of Merger), on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of HRB and its
shareholders and has directed that the Agreement and the Plan of Merger be
submitted to HRBs shareholders for approval at a meeting of such shareholders
and has adopted resolutions to the foregoing effect. Except for the approval
of the Plan of Merger by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of HRB Common Stock (the " _Requisite HRB Vote_ "), the
approval of an amendment to the HRB Articles to change the name of the
Surviving Corporation to "Xenith Bankshares, Inc." by the affirmative vote of

Merger Agreement by the Board of Directors of Bank of Hampton Roads and HRB as
its sole shareholder, and the adoption of resolutions to give effect to the
provisions of Section 6.11 in connection with the Closing, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of HRB are necessary to approve this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by HRB and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Xenith) constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of HRB, enforceable against HRB in accordance with its terms (except in all
cases as such enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions).
The shares of HRB Common Stock to be issued in the Merger have been validly
authorized (subject to the approval of the Merger Agreement by the holders of
HRB Common Stock), when issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and no current or past shareholder of HRB will have any
preemptive right or similar rights in respect thereof.

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by HRB, nor the
consummation by HRB of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by
HRB with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision
of the HRB Articles or the HRB Bylaws, or (ii) assuming that the consents and
approvals referred to in Section 4.4 are duly obtained, (x) violate any
statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or
injunction applicable to HRB, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective

 



      
 

 



 

properties or assets or (y) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any
provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of HRB or
any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement
or other instrument or obligation to which HRB or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound, except (in the case of clause (y) above) for such violations,
conflicts, breaches or defaults that, either individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on HRB.

 



 

4.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (i) the filing of applications,
filings and notices, as applicable, with the NASDAQ, (ii) the filing of
applications, filings and notices, as applicable, with the Federal Reserve
Board under the BHC Act and approval of such applications, filings and

this Agreement and the approval of the listing of such HRB Common Stock on the
NASDAQ, no consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any
Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and
delivery by HRB of this Agreement or (B) the consummation by HRB of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the Bank Merger, the
HRB Bank Payment and the Xenith Bank Payment). As of the date hereof, HRB is
not aware of any reason why the necessary regulatory approvals and consents
will not be received by HRB to permit consummation of the Merger and Bank
Merger on a timely basis.

 



 

4.5 _Reports_. HRB and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports,
registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made
with respect thereto, that they were required to file since January 1, 2012
with any Regulatory Agencies, including, without limitation, any report,
registration or statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws, rules or
regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any
Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on HRB. Except for normal examinations conducted by a
Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of HRB and its
Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding
or, to the knowledge of HRB, investigation into the business or operations of
HRB or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2012. There (i) is no
unresolved material violation, material criticism, or material exception by
any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of HRB or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) has
been no formal or informal material

 



      
 

 



 

inquiry by, or material disagreement or material dispute with, any Regulatory
Agency with respect to the business, operations, policies or procedures of HRB
or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2012.

 



 

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The financial statements of HRB and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the HRB Reports (including the related notes,
where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the
books and records of HRB and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes
in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of HRB and its
Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates
therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end
audit adjustments normal and not material in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of HRB and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Since December 31, 2012, no independent public accounting firm
of HRB has resigned (or informed HRB that it intends to resign) or been
dismissed as independent public accountants of HRB as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with HRB on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

 



 

(b) Neither HRB nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of HRB included in its Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 (including
any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2015, or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in
each case that would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on HRB.

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of HRB and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of HRB or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on HRB. HRB (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to HRB, including its Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of HRB by
others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
HRBs outside auditors and the audit committee of HRBs Board of

 



      
 

 



 

Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect HRBs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in HRBs
internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by management to HRBs auditors and audit committee. There is no
reason to believe that HRBs outside auditors and its chief executive officer
and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2012, (i) neither HRB nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor,
to the knowledge of HRB, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of HRB or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of HRB or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that HRB or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and
(ii) no attorney representing HRB or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by HRB or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by HRB or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the
Board of Directors of HRB or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of HRB,
to any director or officer of HRB.

 



 

4.7 _Broker s Fees_. With the exception of the engagement of Sandler ONeill
+ Partners, L.P., neither HRB nor any HRB Subsidiary nor any of their
respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or
finders fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. HRB has disclosed to Xenith as of the date
hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the engagement by
HRB of Sandler ONeill + Partners, L.P. related to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereunder.

 



 

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 



 

(a) Since December 31, 2014, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on HRB.

 



 

(b) Since December 31, 2014, HRB and its Subsidiaries have carried on their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice.

 



 

4.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 



 

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on HRB, neither HRB nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and
there are

 



      
 

 



 

no pending or, to HRBs knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral
or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against HRB or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their current or former directors or executive officers or challenging the
validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or material regulatory
restriction imposed upon HRB, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of HRB or
any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Each of HRB and its Subsidiaries has duly and
timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in
all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither HRB nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any material Tax Return (other than extensions to
file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). All material Taxes of HRB
and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due
have been fully and timely paid. Each of HRB and its Subsidiaries has withheld
and paid all material taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, shareholder,
independent contractor or other third party. Neither HRB nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period
applicable to any material Tax that remains in effect. The federal income Tax
Returns of HRB and its Subsidiaries for all years to and including 2008 have
been examined by the IRS or are Tax Returns with respect to which the
applicable period for assessment under applicable law, after giving effect to
extensions or waivers, has expired. Neither HRB nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received written notice of assessment or proposed assessment in connection
with any material amount of Taxes, and there are no threatened in writing or
pending disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding
any material Tax of HRB and its Subsidiaries or the assets of HRB and its
Subsidiaries. HRB has made available to Xenith true and complete copies of any
private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain recognition
agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in the last six (6)
years. Neither HRB nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by
any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other
than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among HRB and its
Subsidiaries). Neither HRB nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member
of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other
than a group the common parent of which was HRB) or (B) has any liability for
the Taxes of any person (other than HRB or any of its Subsidiaries) under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.
Neither HRB nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2)
years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)"
within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a
part, a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock
intending to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code.
Neither HRB nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.6011-4(b)(1).
At no time during the past five (5) years has HRB been a United States real
property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code.

 



      
 

 



 

4.11 _Employees_.

 



 

(a) Section 4.11(a) of the HRB Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
correct list of each material HRB Benefit Plan. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _HRB Benefit Plan_ " means each employee benefit plan (as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA, and each bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance or other benefit plan, program or arrangement, and each retention,
bonus, employment, termination, severance plan, program or arrangement or
other contract or agreement (i) to or with respect to which HRB or any
Subsidiary or any trade or business of HRB or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not incorporated, all of which together with HRB would be deemed a "single
employer" within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA (a " _HRB ERISA
Affiliate_ "), is a party or has or, would reasonably be expected to have, any
current or future obligation or (ii) that is maintained, contributed to or
sponsored by HRB or any of its Subsidiaries or any HRB ERISA Affiliate for the
benefit of any current or former employee, officer, director or independent
contractor of HRB or any of its Subsidiaries or any HRB ERISA Affiliate.

 



 

(b) HRB has heretofore made available to Xenith a true and complete copy of
each material HRB Benefit Plan and, with respect to each such HRB Benefit
Plan, the following related documents: (i) all summary plan descriptions,
amendments, modifications or material supplements, (ii) the most recent annual
report (Form 5500), if any, filed with the IRS, (iii) the most recently
received IRS determination letter, if any, and (iv) the most recently prepared
actuarial report (if applicable).

 



 

(c) Each HRB Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all
applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither HRB nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective action or make a filing
under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, Department of Labor or any
other Governmental Entity with respect to any HRB Benefit Plan, and neither
HRB nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect that
would qualify for correction under any such program.

 



 

(d) Section 4.11(d) of the HRB Disclosure Schedule identifies each HRB Benefit
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each,
a " _HRB Qualified Plan_ "). The IRS has issued a favorable determination
letter or opinion letter with respect to each HRB Qualified Plan and the
related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor has revocation been
threatened), and, to the knowledge of HRB, there are no existing circumstances
and no events have occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status
of any HRB Qualified Plan or the related trust or increase the costs relating
thereto. No trust funding any HRB Benefit Plan is intended to meet the
requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 



 

(e) Each HRB Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any award thereunder, in
each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has (i) since January
1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material respects, in good faith
compliance with Section 409A of

 



      
 

 



 

the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1 and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all
material respects, in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A
of the Code.

 



 

(f) None of HRB or any of its Subsidiaries nor any HRB ERISA Affiliate has, at
any time during the last six (6) years, sponsored, maintained or contributed
to or been obligated to contribute to (i) any plan that is subject to Title IV
or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code, (ii) any
Multiemployer Plan or (iii) any Multiple Employer Plan, and none of HRB or any
of its Subsidiaries nor any HRB ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability to
a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or
partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.

 



 

(g) Neither HRB nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or has any
obligation with respect to, any employee benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health or
medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees or
beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of
the Code.

 



 

(h) All contributions required to be made to any HRB Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any HRB
Benefit Plan, for any period through the date hereof, have been timely made or
paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before
the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of HRB.

 



 

(i) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to HRBs knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may
reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the HRB Benefit Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the HRB Benefit Plans or
the assets of any of the trusts under any of the HRB Benefit Plans that could
reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of HRB or any of
its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the Department of Labor, any
Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in a HRB Benefit
Plan, or any other party.

 



 

(j) None of HRB or any of its Subsidiaries nor any HRB ERISA Affiliate nor any
other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA),
which could subject any of the HRB Benefit Plans or their related trusts, HRB,
any of its Subsidiaries, any HRB ERISA Affiliate or any person that HRB or any
of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any material tax or
penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 



 

(k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery
of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to
any employee, officer, director or other service provider of HRB or any of its
Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of HRB or any

 



      
 

 



 

of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
assets from any HRB Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property, or in the form of benefits) by HRB or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a
result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any
other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. Neither HRB nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or
contributes to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle, and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not cause or require HRB or any of its
affiliates to establish or make any contribution to a rabbi trust or similar
funding vehicle.

 



 

(l) No HRB Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes
under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise. HRB has made available
to Xenith true, correct and complete copies of Section 280G calculations

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly (and in the case of the applications,
notices, petitions and filings in respect of the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals, within thirty (30) business days of the date of this Agreement)
prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications,
notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation,
the Merger and the Bank Merger), and which shall also include approval by the
Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Financial Institutions of (i) the
payment, immediately prior to the Closing, of cash from Bank of Hampton Roads
to HRB, whether through dividend, capital reduction or other distribution (the
" _HRB Bank Payment_ ") and (ii) the payment, immediately prior to the
Closing, of cash from Xenith Bank to Xenith, whether through dividend or other
distribution (the " _Xenith Bank Payment_ "), with the aggregate combined
amount of the HRB Bank Payment and the Xenith Bank Payment to be no less than
$20,000,000, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. HRB
and Xenith shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent

applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to Xenith or HRB, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the

 



      
 

 



 

parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The
parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, consider in good faith the
views of the other in connection with any proposed written or material oral
communication with any Governmental Entity related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
herein. The parties hereto agree to furnish to the other a final copy of each
filing made with a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to applicable laws governing the
confidentiality of such information. Each party shall consult with the other
in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its
counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
require HRB or Xenith to take any action, or commit to take any action, or
agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the
foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental
Entities that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to the Merger (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_
").

 



 

(c) HRB and Xenith shall, upon request, furnish each other with all

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) HRB and Xenith shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained, or will be obtained
subject to a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition, or that the receipt
of any such approval will be materially delayed.

 



 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of HRB and
Xenith, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of
the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by
this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and
other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and
records, and each shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute
after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business
operations generally, and, during such period, each of

 



      
 

 



 

HRB and Xenith shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state
banking laws (other than reports or documents which HRB or Xenith, as the case
may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party
may reasonably request. Neither HRB nor Xenith nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of HRBs
or Xeniths, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information
(after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint
defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 



 

(b) Each of HRB and Xenith shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated November 24, 2015, between HRB and Xenith (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



 

6.3 _Shareholders  Approvals_. Each of HRB and Xenith shall call a meeting of
its shareholders (the " _HRB Meeting_ " and the " _Xenith Meeting_ ,"
respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is
declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Xenith Vote and
the Requisite HRB Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger, the Requisite HRB Name Change Vote and, if so desired and mutually
agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of
shareholders to approve a merger agreement, and each shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable
and on the same date. The Board of Directors of each of HRB and Xenith shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of HRB and
Xenith, as the case may be, the Requisite HRB Vote, in the case of HRB, and
the Requisite Xenith Vote, in the case of Xenith, including, except to the
extent otherwise provided herein, by communicating to its respective
shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement) that they approve this Agreement and the Plan of Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby (in the case of Xenith, the " _Xenith
Board Recommendation_ " and in the case of HRB, the " _HRB Board
Recommendation_ "), and shall not fail to make, withdraw, modify or qualify in
a manner adverse to the other party or make any public statement inconsistent
with, the Xenith Board Recommendation, in the case of Xenith, or

 



      
 

 



 

the HRB Board Recommendation, in the case of HRB (a " _Recommendation Change_
"). However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors
of Xenith or HRB, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in its good
faith business judgement that it would more likely than not result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to make
such Xenith Board Recommendation or HRB Board Recommendation, as the case may
be, to its shareholders (and, in the event such determination is made by the
Board of Directors of Xenith in response to a Xenith Acquisition Proposal, the
Xenith Board of Directors has taken into account the expected timing of,
regulatory considerations related to and the form of consideration offered in
such Xenith Acquisition Proposal), such Board of Directors may submit this
Agreement and the Plan of Merger to its shareholders without recommendation
(although the resolutions adopting this Agreement and the Plan of Merger as of
the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of
Directors shall communicate the basis for its Recommendation Change to its
shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent required by law; _provided_ , that the Board
of Directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives
the other party at least five (5) business days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including,
in the event such action is taken by the Board of Directors of Xenith in
response to a Xenith Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and
conditions and the identity of the third party in any such Xenith Acquisition
Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable
detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such notice
period, the Board of Directors takes into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in its good faith business judgment that it
would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law to continue to make the Xenith Board
Recommendation or HRB Board Recommendation, as the case may be. Any material
amendment to any Xenith Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Xenith
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new
notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3; _provided_ that such notice
period shall be three (3) business days. HRB or Xenith may adjourn or postpone
the HRB Meeting or the Xenith Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time
for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares
of HRB Common Stock or Xenith Common Stock, as the case may be, represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting Xenith or HRB, as
applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Xenith Vote or the Requisite HRB
Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the HRB Meeting and
Xenith Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement and the Plan of Merger
shall be submitted to the shareholders of each of HRB and Xenith at the HRB
Meeting and the Xenith Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting on the
approval of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
either HRB or Xenith of such obligation.

 



 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1, each
of HRB and Xenith shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their
reasonable best efforts (a) to

 



      
 

 



 

take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any
other third party that is required to be obtained by Xenith or HRB or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. HRB shall cause the shares of HRB Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject
to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each employee of Xenith and its Subsidiaries as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") shall become employed by HRB (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Surviving Corporation) and its Subsidiaries by operation of law.
During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, HRB shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each
Continuing Employee while employed by HRB and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time, (i) a base salary that is no less favorable than the base
salary provided by Xenith or any such Subsidiary, as applicable, to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual
cash incentive compensation opportunity that is no less favorable than that
provided to similarly situated employees of HRB and its Subsidiaries, and
(iii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
the employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of HRB and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that HRB may satisfy its obligation under Section
6.6(a)(iii) by providing such Continuing Employees with employee benefits that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits
provided by Xenith or its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time until such time as such Continuing
Employees commence participation in the applicable employee benefit plans of
HRB and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Following the Effective Time, HRB shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by
HRB or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in which the Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") to recognize the service of each
Continuing Employee with Xenith and its Subsidiaries (and any successor
thereto) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
level of benefits under such New Plans; _provided_ that such recognition of
service shall not (i) apply for purposes of any New Plan that is a defined
benefit retirement plan or any New Plan that provides retiree welfare
benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Employee with
respect to the same period of service or (iii) apply for purposes of any plan,
program or arrangement (x) under which similarly situated employees of HRB and
its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y) that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation. With respect to any New Plan that provides medical, dental or
vision insurance or benefits, for the plan year in which such Continuing
Employee is first eligible to participate, HRB shall (A)

 



      
 

 



 

cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods
under such plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employee to the
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Xenith
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (B) credit each Continuing Employee for any co-
payments or deductibles incurred by such Continuing Employee in such plan year
for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such New Plan. Such credited expenses shall also count
toward any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar
limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any
right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation,
Xenith, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Xenith, HRB or
any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of
any employee, officer, director or consultant of Xenith or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,
amend, or modify any Xenith Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the
ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any particular Xenith Benefit Plan, New Plan or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after
the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of
Section 9.10, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any person other than the parties hereto, including without
limitation any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of
Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of HRB and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director
and officer of Xenith and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (collectively, the " _Xenith Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the
Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or employee of Xenith or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the same extent as such persons
are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by Xenith pursuant to the
Xenith Articles, Xenith Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of
any Subsidiary of Xenith and any indemnification agreements in existence as of
the date hereof; and HRB and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance
expenses as incurred by such Xenith Indemnified Party to the same extent as
such persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this
Agreement by Xenith pursuant to the Xenith Articles, Xenith Bylaws, the
governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Xenith and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof; _provided_ ,
that the Xenith Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an

 



      
 

 



 

undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Xenith Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Xenith ( _provided_
, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in
excess of 250% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by
Xenith for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the
Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
foregoing, Xenith, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of HRB, may
(and at the request of HRB, Xenith shall use its reasonable best efforts to)
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under
Xeniths existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that
the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed
the Premium Cap.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Xenith Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of
its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar
transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.7.

 



 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of
HRB, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Xenith, on the other) or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by HRB.

 



 

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. HRB and Xenith shall each promptly advise the other
party of any change or event (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that reasonably
could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the
failure of a condition in Article VII; _provided_ , that any failure to give
notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not
be deemed to constitute a violation of this

 



       
 

 



 

Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to
be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party
failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2
or 7.3 to be satisfied; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall not cure any breach of, or
noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

 



 

6.10 _Shareholder Litigation_. Xenith shall give HRB an opportunity to consult
in the defense of any shareholder litigation brought against the Xenith or its
directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and shall give HRB the right to review and comment on all filings
or responses to be made by Xenith in connection with any such litigation, and
the right to consult on the settlement with respect to any such litigation,
and Xenith will in good faith take such comments into account, and no such
settlement shall be agreed without HRBs prior written consent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld).

 



 

6.11 _Post-Merger Organizational Matters_.

 



 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of HRB shall
cause the number of directors that will comprise the full Board of Directors
of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time to be increased to thirteen
(13). Of the members of the initial Board of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation, eight (8) shall be directors of HRB as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time designated by HRB prior to the Closing and five (5) shall
be directors of Xenith as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
designated by Xenith prior to the Closing, each of whom is mutually agreeable
to the parties. The Chairman of the Board of the Surviving Corporation shall
be chosen from among the directors designated by HRB, unless otherwise agreed
by the parties. Each committee of the Board of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time shall include at least one director of
Xenith as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) As of the Effective Time, T. Gaylon Layfield, III, Thomas W. Osgood and
Wellington W. Cottrell, III shall be the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer, respectively, of the Surviving
Corporation and each individual set forth in Section 6.11 of the HRB
Disclosure Schedule shall serve in the respective office set forth beside such
individuals name on such schedule.

 



 

(c) The Surviving Corporation, as the sole shareholder of the Surviving Bank,
shall cause the name of the Surviving Bank to be "Xenith Bank."

 



 

(d) Following the Effective Time, the corporate headquarters for the Surviving
Corporation shall be Xeniths current headquarters.

 



 

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Xenith agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their officers and directors, and will instruct and use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their agents, advisors and representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to any Xenith Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations

 



      
 

 



 

with any person concerning any Xenith Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any
confidential or nonpublic information or data to, have or participate in any
discussions with or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any person in
connection with any Xenith Acquisition Proposal or (iv) unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with its terms, enter into any term sheet,
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with
Section 6.12(b)) relating to any Xenith Acquisition Proposal. Xenith will, and
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other
than HRB regarding any Xenith Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.12(a), prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Xenith Vote, in the event Xenith receives an unsolicited bona fide written
Xenith Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its
and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, provide or cause to be provided
confidential or nonpublic information or data to and engage or participate in
negotiations or discussions with the person making the Xenith Acquisition
Proposal and such persons Representatives if its Board of Directors concludes
in its good faith business judgment (after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel, and with respect to financial matters its financial advisors) that
failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ that prior
to providing any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be
provided pursuant to this Section 6.12(b), Xenith shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to
it in the aggregate than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality
agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate
with Xenith. Xenith will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise HRB
following Xeniths receipt of any such Xenith Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to a Xenith Acquisition
Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms and
conditions of the Xenith Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the person
making such inquiry or Xenith Acquisition Proposal), and will keep HRB
apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a
current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such
inquiry or Xenith Acquisition Proposal. Xenith shall enforce any existing
confidentiality agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
in accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

(c) HRB agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their officers and directors, and will instruct and use reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to any HRB Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any HRB Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to,
have or participate in any discussions with or otherwise cooperate in any way
with, any person in connection with any HRB Acquisition Proposal or (iv)
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, enter
into any term sheet, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in
accordance with Section 6.12(d)) relating to any HRB Acquisition Proposal. HRB
will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to

 



      
 

 



 

cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Xenith regarding any HRB Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding Section 6.12(c), prior to the receipt of the Requisite HRB
Vote, in the event HRB receives an unsolicited bona fide written HRB
Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, provide or cause to be provided confidential
or nonpublic information or data to and engage or participate in negotiations
or discussions with the person making the HRB Acquisition Proposal and such
persons Representatives if its Board of Directors concludes in its good faith
business judgment (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take
such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , that prior to providing
any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to
this Section 6.12(d), HRB shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with such third party on terms no less favorable to it in the aggregate than
the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not
provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with HRB. HRB will
promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Xenith following HRBs receipt
of any such HRB Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be
expected to lead to a HRB Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof
(including the material terms and conditions of the HRB Acquisition Proposal
and the identity of the person making such inquiry or HRB Acquisition
Proposal), and will keep Xenith apprised of any related developments,
discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to
or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or HRB Acquisition Proposal. HRB
shall enforce any existing confidentiality agreements to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

(e) " _Xenith Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or
any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Xenith and
its Subsidiaries or 15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
Xenith or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of Xenith, (ii) any tender
offer (including a self-tender offer), exchange offer or other acquisition of
equity or voting securities that, if consummated, would result in such third
party beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of Xenith or one of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of
Xenith, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving Xenith or one of its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the
consolidated assets of Xenith.

 



 

(f) " _HRB Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or
any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 15% or more of the consolidated assets of HRB and its
Subsidiaries or 15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of HRB
or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of HRB, (ii)
any tender offer (including a self-tender offer), exchange offer or other
acquisition of equity or voting securities that, if consummated, would result
in such third party beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of HRB or one of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of
HRB, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving HRB or one of its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the consolidated
assets of HRB, which in any of the foregoing cases would reasonably be
expected to (x) materially interfere with, adversely affect or delay the
consummation of the Merger or the receipt of the Requisite HRB vote, or (y)
result in a Recommendation Change by the Board of Directors of HRB.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Xenith, HRB or their
respective Boards of Directors or any committee thereof from at any time
taking and disclosing to Xeniths or HRBs shareholders, as applicable, a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a), or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that any such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Recommendation Change by Xenith or HRB, as
applicable, unless the Board of Directors reaffirms the Xenith Board
Recommendation, in the case of Xenith, or the HRB Board Recommendation, in the
case of HRB, in such statement without qualification, and shall have the
consequences provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

6.13 _Public Announcements_. Xenith and HRB shall each use their reasonable
best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to ensure that
all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required by
applicable law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ that this Section 6.13 shall not apply with respect to any
disclosures or communications relating to a Xenith Acquisition Proposal or HRB
Acquisition Proposal, subject to compliance with the terms of Section 6.3 and
Section 6.12 with respect thereto.

 



 

6.14 _Takeover Statutes_. None of Xenith, HRB or their respective Boards of
Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to
become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the members
of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 



      
 

 



 

6.15 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Xenith and HRB agree
that, to most effectively compensate and retain Xenith Insiders (as defined
below), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that
Xenith Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in
connection with the conversion of shares of Xenith Common Stock and Xenith
Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose
agree to the provisions of this Section 6.15. Xenith shall deliver to HRB in a
reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information
regarding those officers and directors of Xenith subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Xenith Insiders_ "),
and the Board of Directors of HRB and of Xenith, or a committee of non-
employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in
any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required
to cause (in the case of Xenith) any dispositions of Xenith Common Stock or
Xenith Equity Awards (including the conversion of Xenith Stock Options into
Xenith Adjusted Options and the conversion of Xenith Warrants into Xenith
Adjusted Warrants) by the Xenith Insiders, and (in the case of HRB) any
acquisitions of HRB Common Stock or HRB Equity Awards by any Xenith Insiders
who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the
Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

 



 

6.16 _Existing Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) Xenith shall deliver all notices and take all other actions (subject to
the Requisite Regulatory Approvals under Section 6.1(b)) to facilitate the
termination at the Closing of all commitments in respect of Credit Agreement,
dated October 28, 2015 among Xenith and Raymond James Bank, N.A., as lender,
as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (the "
_Existing Credit Facility_ ") and the repayment in full on the Closing Date of
all obligations in respect of the indebtedness thereunder; _provided_ , that
Xenith and HRB shall cooperate to provide any funds required to effect all
such repayments at or prior to the Closing. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, Xenith shall use reasonable best efforts to
deliver to HRB at least two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date an
executed payoff letter with respect to the Existing Credit Facility (the "
_Payoff Letter_ ") in form and substance customary for transactions of this
type, which Payoff Letter shall, among other things, include the payoff
amount.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Xenith shall take all actions required by the
documentation governing the 6.75% subordinated notes due 2025, dated as of
June 26, 2015 (the " _Subordinated Notes_ "). Prior to the Closing Date,
Xenith and HRB shall cooperate to prepare any instrument required by the
documentation governing the Subordinated Notes pursuant to which HRB shall
assume the obligations of Xenith with respect to the Subordinated Notes as of
the Closing (the " _Supplemental Instrument_ ") and any related certificates
and other documents required by the documentation governing the Subordinated
Notes. On the Closing Date, HRB and Xenith, as and to the extent required by
the documentation governing the Subordinated Notes, shall execute and deliver
any such Supplemental Instrument and any related certificates and other
documents.

representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date, in which case as

sentence, such representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true and
correct unless the failure or failures of such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct, either individually or in the aggregate, and

than the Xenith Balance Sheet Date.

the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Xenith at or prior
to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date). All other
representations and warranties of HRB set forth in this Agreement (read
without giving effect to any qualification as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or warranties but, in each
case, after giving effect to the lead in to Article IV) shall be true and
correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing
Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent such
representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date, in which case as

correct unless the failure or failures of such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct, either individually or in the aggregate, and
without giving effect to any qualification as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or warranties, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on HRB. Xenith

Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of HRB to the foregoing

as of the Closing Date, to the effect that, on the basis of facts,

368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel may require and rely
upon representations contained in certificates of officers of HRB and Xenith,

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 



 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned
at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of
this Agreement and the Plan of Merger by the shareholders of HRB or Xenith:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) by mutual consent of HRB and Xenith in a written instrument, if the Board
of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of
its entire Board;

 



 

(b) by either the Board of Directors of HRB or the Board of Directors of
Xenith if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory
Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the Bank Merger and such denial
has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the
Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory
Approval shall be due to, or materially contributed to by, the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 



 

(c) by either the Board of Directors of HRB or the Board of Directors of
Xenith if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the one year
anniversary date of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the
failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to, or materially
contributed to by, the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set
forth herein;

 



 

(d) by HRB or Xenith ( _provided_ , that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or
agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such
representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement
on the part of Xenith, in the case of a termination by HRB, or HRB, in the
case of a termination by Xenith, which breach or failure to be true, either
individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or
failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute,
if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by HRB, or Section 7.3, in
the case of a termination by Xenith, and which is not cured within thirty (30)
days following written notice to Xenith, in the case of a termination by HRB,
or HRB, in the case of a termination by Xenith, or by its nature or timing
cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the
Termination Date);

 



 

(e) by Xenith, if the Board of Directors of HRB shall have (i) made a
Recommendation Change or made any public statement inconsistent with the HRB
Board Recommendation, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such
recommendation within four (4) business days after Xenith requests in writing
that such action be taken, (ii) recommended or endorsed a HRB Acquisition
Proposal, or failed to issue a press release announcing its opposition to a
HRB Acquisition Proposal, within ten (10) business days after a HRB
Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or (iii) breached its obligations
under Section 6.3 or Section 6.12 in any material respect;

 



 

(f) by HRB, if the Board of Directors of Xenith shall have (i) made a
Recommendation Change or made any public statement inconsistent with the
Xenith Board Recommendation, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such
recommendation within four

 



       
 

 



 

(4) business days after HRB requests in writing that such action be taken,
(ii) recommended or endorsed a Xenith Acquisition Proposal, or failed to issue
a press release announcing its opposition to a Xenith Acquisition Proposal,
within ten (10) business days after a Xenith Acquisition Proposal is publicly
announced or (iii) breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or Section 6.12
in any material respect; or

 



 

(g) by either HRB or Xenith if (i) the Requisite HRB Vote is not obtained at
the duly convened HRB Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof at
which a vote on the approval of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger is taken
or (ii) the Requisite Xenith Vote is not obtained at the duly convened Xenith
Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the
approval of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger is taken.

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either HRB or Xenith as
provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have
no effect, and none of HRB, Xenith, any of their respective Subsidiaries or
any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of
any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 6.2(b) and this Section 8.2 and
Article IX (other than Section 9.1) shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither HRB nor Xenith shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Xenith Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made known to the Board of Directors or senior management of Xenith
or has been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall
have publicly announced a Xenith Acquisition Proposal with respect to Xenith
and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by HRB pursuant to Section
8.1(g)(ii) or by either HRB or Xenith pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and the
Requisite Xenith Vote has not been obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement
is terminated by HRB pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (C) prior to the date
that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Xenith enters
into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to a
Xenith Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Xenith Acquisition
Proposal as that referred to above), then Xenith shall, on the earlier of the
date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of
such transaction, pay HRB, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to
$4,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of this
Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of Xenith Acquisition
Proposal to "15%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by HRB pursuant to Section
8.1(f) or by Xenith pursuant to Section 8.1(g)(ii), then Xenith shall pay HRB,
by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of
termination.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Xenith pursuant to
Section 8.1(e) or by HRB pursuant to Section 8.1(g)(i), then HRB shall pay
Xenith, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of
termination.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages to the extent permitted
herein, in no event shall either party be required to pay the Termination Fee
more than once.

 



 

(f) Each of HRB and Xenith acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if HRB or Xenith fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment,
the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-
paying party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying
party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if
HRB or Xenith, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant
to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue
amounts at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by
JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which
such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date
that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

 



 

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with Merger by the shareholders of HRB and
Xenith; _provided_ , _however_ , that after approval of this Agreement and the
Plan of Merger by the respective shareholders of HRB or Xenith, there may not
be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this
Agreement that requires further approval under applicable law. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the parties hereto.

 



 

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained herein; _provided_
, _however_ , that after approval of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger by
the respective shareholders of HRB or Xenith, there may not be, without
further approval of such shareholders, any extension or waiver of this
Agreement or any portion thereof that requires further approval under
applicable law. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE
TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO

Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in Section 6.7, this Agreement (including the documents
and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

 



 

9.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be

any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

9.13 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner

 



      
 

 



 

and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or

4. _Manner and Basis of Converting Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any shares of capital stock of Xenith or HRB:

 



 

(a) _HRB Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of HRB (" **HRB Common Stock** ") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

 



 

(b) _Xenith Common Stock_.

 



 

(i) Subject to Section 6(e), each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of Xenith issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " **Xenith Common Stock** "), except for shares of Xenith Common
Stock owned by Xenith or HRB (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency
capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted), shall be converted
into the right to receive 4.4 shares (the " **Exchange Ratio** " and such
shares, the " **Merger Consideration** ") of HRB Common Stock.

 



 

(ii) All of the shares of Xenith Common Stock converted into the right to
receive HRB Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each
certificate (each a " **Certificate** ," which term shall include book entry
account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Xenith Common Stock)
previously representing any such shares of Xenith Common Stock shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive (A) a certificate representing
the number of whole shares of HRB Common Stock that such shares of Xenith
Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive, (B) cash in lieu
of fractional shares that the shares of Xenith Common Stock represented by
such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Section 4(b)(ii) and Section 6(e), without any interest thereon, and (C)
any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 6. Certificates previously representing shares of
Xenith Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole
shares of HRB Common Stock (together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration
therefor) upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section
6, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of HRB Common Stock or Xenith Common Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind
of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,

  (3) If the shareholders of HRB approve the name change amendment, include the
bracketed text.

 



 

(4) If the shareholders of HRB _do not_ approve the name change amendment,
include the bracketed text.

 



      
 

 



 

reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend
or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to
the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Merger
Agreement, at the Effective Time, all shares of Xenith Common Stock that are
owned by Xenith or HRB (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency
capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no stock of HRB or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Xenith Equity Awards_.

 



 

(i) _Xenith Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each compensatory option
granted by Xenith to purchase shares of Xenith Common Stock (a " **Xenith
Stock Option** "), whether or not vested, that is outstanding and unexercised
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an
option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Xenith Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, including
vesting (and any applicable accelerated vesting), a number of shares of HRB
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Xenith Common Stock subject to
such Xenith Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio (rounding any resultant fractional share down to the
nearest whole number of shares) at a price per share of HRB Common Stock equal
to the price per share under such Xenith Stock Option divided by the Exchange
Ratio (rounding any resultant fractional cent up to the nearest whole cent)
(each, as so adjusted, a " **Xenith Adjusted Option** ").

 



 

(ii) _Xenith Restricted Stock Awards_.

 



 

(A) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Xenith Common
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted by
Xenith that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
**Xenith Restricted Stock Award** ") and becomes vested by its terms at the
Effective Time or by reason of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of
each share of Xenith Common Stock underlying such Xenith Restricted Stock
Award and, unless the holder of the Xenith Restricted Stock Award makes a cash
payment to Xenith at or before the Effective Time for applicable tax
withholdings, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of a Xenith
Restricted Stock Award shall be reduced by applicable tax withholdings as
described in Section 4(c)(iv).

 



 

(B) At the Effective Time, each Xenith Restricted Stock Award that does not by
its terms become vested at the Effective Time or by reason of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement shall, automatically
and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a HRB restricted stock award with the same terms and conditions
(including vesting provisions) as were applicable to such Xenith Restricted
Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, relating to the number of
shares of HRB Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the Exchange Ratio,
multiplied by (2) the number of shares of Xenith Common Stock subject to such
Xenith Restricted Stock

 



      
 

 



 

Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounding any resultant
fractional share to the nearest whole number of shares).

 



 

(iii) _Xenith Restricted Stock Unit Awards_.

 



 

(A) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
shares of Xenith Common Stock granted by Xenith that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " **Xenith Restricted Stock Unit
Award** ") and becomes vested and/or payable by its terms at the Effective
Time or by reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Xenith Common
Stock underlying such Xenith Restricted Stock Unit Award and, unless the
holder of the Xenith Restricted Stock Unit Award makes a cash payment to
Xenith at or before the Effective Time for applicable tax withholdings, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of a Xenith Restricted Stock Unit
Award shall be reduced by applicable tax withholdings as described in Section
4(c)(iv).

 



 

(B) At the Effective Time, each Xenith Restricted Stock Unit Award that does
not by its terms become vested at the Effective Time or by reason of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or that
is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time or by reason of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and does
not by its terms become payable at the Effective Time, shall, automatically
and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a HRB restricted stock unit award with the same terms and
conditions (including vesting and payment provisions) as were applicable to
such Xenith Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, relating to the number of shares of HRB Common Stock equal to the
product of (1) the Exchange Ratio, multiplied by (2) the number of shares of
Xenith Common Stock subject to such Xenith Restricted Stock Unit Award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounding any resultant fractional
share to the nearest whole number of shares).

 



 

(iv) _Withholdings_. If the applicable tax withholdings are not paid to Xenith
in cash as provided in Section 4(c)(ii)(A) or Section 4(c)(iii)(A), the number
of shares of HRB Common Stock withheld from the consideration otherwise
deliverable to each holder of a Xenith Restricted Stock Award or Xenith
Restricted Stock Unit Award under Section 4(c)(ii)(A) or Section 4(c)(iii)(A)
for purposes of satisfying applicable tax withholding shall be calculated by
assuming that the value of a share of HRB Common Stock is equal to the HRB
Share Closing Price.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Xenith Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant
exercisable into shares of Xenith Common Stock (" **Xenith Warrant** ") that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted in accordance with its terms into a warrant to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Xenith Warrant, a number of
shares of HRB Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Xenith Common
Stock subject to such Xenith Warrant immediately before the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounding any resultant fractional share down
to the nearest whole share) at a price per share of HRB Common Stock equal to
the price per share under such

 



      
 

 



 

Xenith Warrant divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounding any resultant
fractional cent up to the nearest cent).

 



 

5. _Exchange Agent_ _._ At or prior to the Effective Time, HRB shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent designated by HRB and reasonably acceptable to Xenith (the " **Exchange Agent** "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Section 5 and Section 6, certificates or, at HRBs option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively, referred to herein as " **certificates** "), representing the shares of HRB Common Stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of HRB Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " **Exchange Fund** "), to be issued pursuant to Sections 4(b) and 4(c) and paid pursuant to Section 6(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Xenith Common Stock.

 



 

6. _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, HRB shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of
Xenith Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive HRB Common Stock
pursuant to Section 4, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole shares of HRB
Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of
Xenith Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have
been converted into the right to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement as
well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 6(b).
Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable,
(i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of HRB Common Stock
to which such holder of Xenith Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 and (ii) a check representing the
amount of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 and this Section 6 and (B) any
dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive
pursuant to this Section 6, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration, dividends or distributions or cash in lieu of fractional
shares payable to holders of Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 6, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the
number of whole shares of HRB Common Stock which the shares of Xenith Common
Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to
receive and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends
or distributions as contemplated by this Section 6.

 



 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to HRB Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such
holder

 



      
 

 



 

shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with Section 5 and this Section
6. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with Section 5 and this
Section 6, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of HRB Common
Stock that the shares of Xenith Common Stock represented by such Certificate
have been converted into the right to receive.

 



 

(c) If any certificate representing shares of HRB Common Stock is to be issued
in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered
in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer)
and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing
shares of HRB Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any
other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Xenith of the shares of Xenith Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of HRB Common Stock as provided in Section 5
and this Section 6.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of HRB Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution
with respect to HRB Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of HRB. In lieu
of the issuance of any such fractional share, HRB shall pay to each former
shareholder of Xenith who otherwise would be entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of HRB Common Stock on
the NASDAQ Global Select Market as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for
the five (5) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date
(or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually agreed
upon by Xenith and HRB) (the " **HRB Share Closing Price** ") by (ii) the
fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of HRB Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4(b).

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Xenith for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of Xenith who have
not theretofore complied with this Section 6 shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the shares of HRB Common Stock, cash in
lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
the HRB Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Xenith
Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, in each

 



      
 

 



 

case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
HRB, Xenith, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Xenith Common Stock for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(g) HRB shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent
to deduct and withhold, from any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares of HRB Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to this Section 6 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
the Merger Agreement to any holder of Xenith Common Stock or Xenith Equity
Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by HRB or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate
governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of the Merger Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Xenith Common
Stock or Xenith Equity Awards in respect of which the deduction and
withholding was made by HRB or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by HRB, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as HRB may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of HRB Common Stock
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(i) In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no appraisal rights shall
be available to the holders of Xenith Common Stock in connection with the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 



 

7. _Amendment_. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, this Plan of Merger may be amended by the Boards of Directors of HRB and Xenith at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that any amendment made subsequent to the approval of this Plan of Merger by the shareholders of HRB and Xenith shall not:

interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or eligible
interests, cash or other property to be received under the plan by the

(c) alter or change any term of the articles of incorporation of HRB or
Xenith; except as permitted by Section 13.1-706 of the VSCA.

the manner determined by the Boards of Directors of HRB and Xenith. Written
notice of such abandonment shall be filed with the SCC prior to the Effective
Time.
