  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 1, 2004 (this "
_Agreement_ "), between AIXTRON AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a stock corporation (
_Aktiengesellschaft_ ) organized under the laws of the Federal Republic of
Germany and registered with the Commercial Register under HRB 7002 ("
_Parent_ "), and GENUS, INC., a California corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  

 WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has determined that the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Sub with and into the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders and has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions in accordance with the California General Corporation Law (the " _CGCL_ "), whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, without par value, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), not owned by Parent, Sub or the Company, shall be converted into the right to receive American Depositary Shares of Parent (the " _Parent ADSs_ "), representing no-par value bearer shares ( _auf den Inhaber lautende St uckaktien ohne Nennbetrag_) of Parent (" _Parent Ordinary Shares_ "), with each Parent ADS representing one Parent Ordinary Share pursuant to the terms of the deposit agreement between Parent and the Depositary (the " _Deposit Agreement_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS the executive board ( _Vorstand_ ) of Parent (the " _Parent Executive Board_ "), with the approval of the supervisory board ( _Aufsichtsrat_ ) of Parent (the " _Parent Supervisory Board_ "), has determined that this Agreement is in the best interest of Parent and its shareholders and the Parent Executive Board and the Parent Supervisory Board have approved this Agreement and the Transactions in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany; 

  

 WHEREAS, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes it is intended that the Merger and the Share Exchange qualify as a " _reorganization_ " within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 

_THE MERGER_

  

 SECTION 1.01 _Appointment of Trust Company; Formation of Merger Sub; The Merger_. 

   

 (a) _ Appointment of Trust Company._ As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company or other independent financial institution which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Trust Company_ ") to act as (i) contribution agent in connection with the formation of Sub and the Share Exchange (in such function, the " _Contribution Agent_ "), pursuant to a contribution agreement between Parent and the Contribution Agent which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, (ii) depositary under the Deposit Agreement in connection with the issuance of Parent ADSs evidenced by Parent ADRs (in such function, the " _Depositary_ "), and (iii) exchange agent in connection with the Share Exchange (in such function, the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Parent shall enter into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, which agreement shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and obligations of the Exchange Agent consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Parent may appoint one or more substitute persons reasonably acceptable to the Company to perform any of the functions of the Trust Company described herein. 

  

 (b) _ Formation of Merger Sub._ As promptly as practicable following such appointment, the Contribution Agent shall cause to be incorporated pursuant to the CGCL a corporation which shall be 

        
  

a constituent company in the Merger (" _Sub_ ") and which shall not transact
any business other than participating in the Merger. Solely to accommodate
the transactions described in this Article I and Article II, the Contribution
Agent shall hold all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock,
without par value, of Sub (the " _Sub Common Stock_ ").

  

 (c) _ The Merger._ On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the CGCL, Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the CGCL. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, the Share Issuance, the Share Capital Increase, and the Share Exchange, are referred to in this Agreement collectively as " _Transactions_ ". 

  

 SECTION 1.02 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall take place at the offices of McDermott Will and Emery LLP, 50 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10020 at 10:00 a.m. on the second business day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver by all parties) of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01, or, if on such day any condition set forth in Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof), as soon as practicable (but no later than two business days) after all of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the parties entitled to the benefits thereof), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". 

  

 SECTION 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a copy of the agreement of merger, together with an officer\'s certificate of each constituent corporation (collectively, and substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A, the " _Agreement of Merger_ "), shall be delivered by the Company to the Secretary of State of the State of California for filing, in accordance with Section 1103 of the CGCL, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Agreement of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of California or at such time thereafter as is agreed to between Parent and the Company and provided in the Agreement of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 SECTION 1.04 _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 1107 of the CGCL. 

  

 SECTION 1.05 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. (a) The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein and by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) The Restated Bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein and by applicable Law. 

  

 SECTION 1.06 _Directors_. The directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to have resigned, and the directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified in accordance with the CGCL and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be. 

  

 SECTION 1.07 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with the CGCL and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be. 

        
 

    
ARTICLE II 

_EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; SHARE EXCHANGE_

   

 SECTION 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of Sub Common Stock: 

  

 (a) _ Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of Sub Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value, of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "). 

  

 (b) _ Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Company Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no Parent ADSs or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) _ Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Subject to Sections 2.01(d), 2.01(b) and 2.02(e), each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive 0.51 Parent ADSs (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder (including, for avoidance of doubt, the Company Trust) of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest. The Parent ADSs to be issued upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and cash to be delivered in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs that would otherwise be issued upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.02(e) are referred to collectively as " _Merger Consideration_ ". In no event shall Parent be obligated to issue (but may issue, if Parent so elects) an aggregate number of Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent ADSs in connection with the Transactions in excess of 27,000,000 (the " _Maximum Number_ ") in either case. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including Section 5.01(a)), the Company shall not issue any shares of Company Common Stock, options, equity securities or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for equity securities, to the extent that any such issuance would result (by way of conversion of such securities by the Merger into the right to receive Parent ADSs) in Parent being obligated to issue an aggregate number of Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent ADSs in connection with the Transactions in excess of the Maximum Number in either case, unless and to the extent Parent elects to do so. 

  

 (d) _ Dissenter\'s Rights._ Shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who, subject to and in accordance with Section 1300 et seq. of the CGCL, has duly demanded the Company to purchase such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the CGCL and has complied with all of the provisions of the CGCL concerning the right of such holder to demand the Company to purchase such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into a right to receive Merger Consideration, unless such holder withdraws or otherwise loses the right to demand purchase pursuant to the CGCL of such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock. Instead, such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive such cash consideration as may be determined to be due to such holder as provided in the CGCL. If after the Effective Time such holder withdraws or otherwise loses the right to demand purchase pursuant to the CGCL of such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(c). The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for purchase of 

        
  

shares pursuant to Section 1300 et seq. of the CGCL received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer

 SECTION 2.02 _Share Exchange_. 

   

 (a) _ Share Exchange._ As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and in accordance with Sections 202 _et seq._ (including Sections 185 and 187) of the German Stock Corporation Law ( _Aktiengesetz_ ) (the " _GSCL_ ") and any additional requirements pursuant to Section 6.14, Parent shall: (i) effect the increase of its stated share capital ( _Grundkapital_ ) by (A) using authorized share capital ( _Ausnutzung Genehmigten Kapitals_ ) to issue new Parent Ordinary Shares at nominal value without premium ( _zum geringsten Ausgabebetrag_ ) underlying the Merger Consideration to the Contribution Agent for the benefit of the former holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (the " _Share Issuance_ ") against the contribution by the Contribution Agent to Parent of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock by contribution-in-kind by a resolution ( _Vorstandsbeschluss_ ) of the Parent Executive Board with the approval ( _Zustimmung des Aufsichtsrats_ ) of the Parent Supervisory Board and (B) registering the implementation of such increase of Parent\'s stated capital with the commercial register ( _Handelsregister_ ) of the local court ( _Amtsgericht_ ) Aachen of Parent (the " _Commercial Register_ ") (such registration, the " _Share Capital Increase_ "); and (ii) cause (A) the Contribution Agent to deposit with the Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Parent Ordinary Shares underlying the Merger Consideration, (B) the Depositary to issue to the Exchange Agent the Parent ADSs comprising the Merger Consideration and (C) the Exchange Agent to deliver in accordance with this Article II, the Parent ADSs reflecting the Merger Consideration and evidenced by Parent ADRs to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock (such Parent ADSs, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and any cash in lieu of Parent ADRs representing fractional Parent ADSs (the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) above, collectively, the " _Share Exchange_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Parent ADSs evidenced by American Depositary Receipts issued by the Depository on behalf of Parent (" _Parent ADRs_ ") contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.01 out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with Section 2.02(b). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. At the Effective Time, Parent\'s obligation to effect the Share Exchange shall become unconditional, subject only to the completion of the contribution-in-kind by the Contribution Agent described in this Section 2.02(a). Subject to the approval of the Commercial Register, the transfer ( _dingliche und schuldrechtliche Übertragung_) of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to Parent by the Contribution Agent by contribution-in-kind shall be made subject to the condition subsequent that the implementation of the capital increase ( _Durchf uhrung der Kapitalerhohung_) is registered in the Commercial Register within a reasonable period of time following the filing of the application for registration; _provided_ , that if the Commercial Register refuses such registration because of the condition subsequent, the contribution-in-kind shall be made without such condition subsequent. 

  

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures._ In furtherance of the Share Exchange, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as 

        
  

may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a Parent ADR
representing that number of whole Parent ADSs (together with cash in lieu of
fractional Parent ADSs) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until such time as a Parent ADR representing Parent
ADSs is issued to or at the direction of the holder of a surrendered
Certificate, such Parent ADSs, and the Parent Ordinary Shares underlying such
Parent ADSs, shall be deemed not outstanding and shall not be entitled to vote
on any matter. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a Parent ADR
representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent ADSs may be issued to
a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of Parent ADSs
to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Section 2.02 and any dividends or distributions pursuant
to Section 2.02(c). No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.

  

 (c) _ Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent ADSs, or the Parent Ordinary Shares underlying such Parent ADSs, with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any Certificate formerly representing Company Common Stock with respect to the Parent ADSs issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e), until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of Parent ADRs representing whole Parent ADSs issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional Parent ADS to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent ADSs, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole Parent ADSs. 

  

 (d) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock (including any dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (e) _ No Fractional Shares._ (1) No Parent ADRs representing fractional Parent ADSs shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent ADSs. 

        
  

For purposes of this Section 2.02(e), all fractional shares to which a single
record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be
rounded to three decimal places.

   

 (2) In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to such holder\'s proportionate interest, if any, in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions (which sale transactions shall be made at such times, in such manner and on such terms as the Exchange Agent shall determine in its reasonable discretion) on behalf of all such holders of the aggregate of the fractional Parent ADSs, as applicable, which would otherwise have been issued pursuant to Section 2.01 (the " _Excess Parent ADSs_ "). The sale of the Excess Parent ADSs by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the Nasdaq National Market, at such time as the Parent ADSs are quoted on the Nasdaq National Market, and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of Certificates, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust (the " _Exchange Trust_ ") for the holders of Certificates. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent ADSs, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of Certificates without interest. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds, less all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with this sale of the Excess Parent ADSs, by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of shares of Company Common Stock is entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional interests to which all holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock are entitled. 

  

 (f) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered, subject to applicable Law, to Parent (or, at the election of Parent, the Exchange Agent or the Company Trust), upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent (or the Exchange Agent or the Company Trust, as applicable) for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent ADSs as contemplated by this Article II. 

  

 (g) _ No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent ADSs (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration or any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent ADSs as contemplated by Section 2.02(c)(i) in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity) any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (h) _ Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Trust, on a daily basis, in obligations of the United States of America. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of and shall be paid to Parent. 

  

 (i) _ Reclassification, etc._ If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, all the outstanding Parent Ordinary Shares shall have been changed, or offered the opportunity to change, into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of the occurrence of any reclassification, 

        
  

recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Exchange
Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted, to the extent necessary to reflect such
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.

  

 (j) _ Withholding Rights._ Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, the Surviving Corporation shall be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of the type of consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority. 

   

 (k) _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Parent ADSs and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c), in each case, without any interest thereon. 

   

 SECTION 2.03 _Treatment of Stock Options_. 

  

 (a) Promptly after the date hereof the Company shall establish a trust (which shall not be affiliated with either Parent or the Company), the purpose of which shall be to hold shares of Company Common Stock to be issued to holders of Company Employee Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and for the purposes described in Section 6.13 (the " _Company Trust_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall issue and deliver to the Company Trust such number of shares of Company Common Stock as shall be necessary to satisfy the obligations under all unexercised Company Employee Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Each Company Employee Stock Option granted prior to the Effective Time and which remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into an option to acquire from the Company Trust, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Employee Stock Option (but taking into account any changes thereto, by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions as may be provided for in the Company Stock Plans, in any award agreement or in such option), that number of Parent ADSs determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Employee Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole Parent ADS, at a price per share (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) equal to the per share exercise price specified in such Company Employee Stock Option or Company Stock Plan, as applicable, divided by the Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any Company Employee Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares subject to such Company Employee Stock Option and the terms and conditions related to the exercise of such Company Employee Stock Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; provided, further, that in the case of any Company Employee Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 423 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares subject to such Company Employee Stock Option and the terms and conditions related to the exercise of such Company Employee Stock Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code and the adjustment to the exercise price shall only apply to the 

        
  

determination of the exercise price of the Company Employee Stock Option at
the beginning of such option\'s offering period.

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) cause the plan administrator of each of the Company Stock Plans to determine that the adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.03 are sufficient to not cause any vesting in connection with the Merger as a result of such adjustments, and (ii) deliver to the holders of Company Employee Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders\' rights (including that the Company Trust shall satisfy the obligations under the Company Employee Stock Options) and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Employee Stock Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.03). 

   

 (d) No later than 5 business days following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the Parent ADSs subject to such Company Employee Stock Options and shall use reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements for so long as such Company Employee Stock Options remain outstanding. 

  

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement: 

  

   

" _Company Employee Stock Option_ " means any option to purchase Company
Common Stock under any Company Stock Plan.

   

" _Company Stock Plans_ " means the Company\'s 2000 Incentive Stock Option
Plan and 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

 (f) Except as disclosed in Section 3.11(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof will not (i) entitle any employee, officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to severance pay, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement.

pendency of any suit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation by any
Governmental Entity or any third party in connection with any such violation,

any one instance; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of
costs, liabilities or expenses referred to in the exceptions at the end of

by and in compliance with Section 5.02(b). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to Section
6.01(d) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal
or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Company Board of its approval
or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger.

  

 (b) Neither the Company nor the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company or the Company Board of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to any Company Takeover Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal.

The Company acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification to the price terms, and/or each successive material modification to the terms, of a Company Takeover Proposal that is determined to be a Superior 

        
  

Company Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a new Superior Company
Proposal for purposes of this Section 5.02(b), except that the reference to
"three German business days" in clause (4) of the second sentence of this
Section 5.02(b) shall be deemed to be a reference to "one German business day"
for purposes of this sentence.

   

 (c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Takeover Proposal, the identity of the person or persons making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the material terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry, and use reasonable efforts to orally notify Parent that such written notice has been sent. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status, including any change to the terms, of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company from any third party (other than due diligence information with respect to such third party) in connection with any Company Takeover Proposal or sent or provided by the Company to any third party in connection with any Company Takeover Proposal. 

  

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02(d) shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to the Company\'s shareholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to so disclose would result in a violation of the Company\'s obligations under applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by Section 5.02(b). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.02(d), the Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof may not take, agree or resolve to take any action that would result in the Company\'s shareholders no longer being legally capable under the CGCL of validly approving this Agreement; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, this sentence shall not operate to nullify the provisions of Section 5.02(b), as and to the extent specifically provided therein.

 " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar transaction involving the Company (other than a merger or consolidation of a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Company with another person in connection with which the Company would issue less than 15% of its equity securities, securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for equity securities or Voting Company Debt), (ii) any proposal or offer for the issuance by the Company of over 15% of its equity securities, securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for equity securities or Voting Company Debt as consideration for the assets or securities of another person, (iii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 15% of the equity securities, securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for equity securities or Voting Company Debt or consolidated total assets of the Company or (iv) any proposal or offer to lease, mortgage, pledge or otherwise transfer (including through any arrangement having substantially the same economic effect of a sale of assets) over 15% of the consolidated total assets of the Company, in each case, in a single transaction or a series of transactions, other than the Transactions.

advisor), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal
and this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the
Transactions or this Agreement) and (ii) that is reasonably capable of being

 SECTION 6.03 _Reasonable Efforts; Notification_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of 

        
  

all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from

filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking
of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain a Consent or waiver

Agreement and (ii) if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the

Florio Amendment to the Defense Production Act of 1950 (the " _Exon-
Florio Amendment_ "); _provided, however_ , that Parent shall have made such
request within 60 days after the date hereof.

Parent shall be entitled to control (after good faith consultation with the Company) all contact and negotiations with any Governmental Entity concerning Antitrust and Trade Laws matters relevant to the Transactions. Parent shall also be responsible for determining (after good faith consultation with the Company) all aspects of strategy associated with obtaining any approvals, consents or waivers necessary to consummate the Transactions as required under any Antitrust and Trade Laws. Each of Parent and the Company agrees not to participate in any meeting(s) with any Government Entity in respect of any submission, notification or investigation under any Antitrust and Trade Laws unless such party consults with the other in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives such party or the other party\'s counsel a reasonable opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting(s). 

  

 SECTION 6.04 _Benefit Plans_. Effective as of the Effective Time and until December 31, 2005, Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries and successors to provide, those persons who, at the Effective Time, were employees of the Company (" _Covered Employees_ "), with base salary, bonus opportunity and benefits (excluding equity based compensation) during their continuing employment that are substantially equivalent, in the aggregate, to the base salary, bonus opportunity and benefits (excluding equity based compensation) provided to such employees as of the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any Company Benefit Plan which shall be amended on or prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.03; and _provided, further_ , that nothing herein shall restrict Parent or the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any such employees in accordance with applicable Laws and contractual rights, if any, of such employees, or amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan. Covered Employees shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and future vacation accruals under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent or one of the 

        
  

Parent Subsidiaries for service accrued or deemed accrued with the Company
prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that such crediting
of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit.

   

 SECTION 6.05 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of incorporation or by-laws shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time, and Parent agrees to guarantee (subject to 6.05(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter), from and after the Effective Time, such indemnification obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries provided in their respective articles of incorporation or by-laws and pursuant to agreements in effect as of the date hereof, as and to the extent that the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, cease to be able to satisfy such obligations. 

  

 (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that neither Parent nor the Company shall not be obligated, and Parent shall not be obligated to cause the Company, to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 175% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such 175% amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors\' and officers\' insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. The Company represents to Parent that the Maximum Premium is set forth in Section 6.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

  

 SECTION 6.06 _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

  

 (b) In the event that: (1) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(d) (other than Section 8.01(d)(iii)); or (2) a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced (or, with respect to subclause (x) of this clause (2), a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to the Company) or a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been made directly to the shareholders of the Company generally or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Company Takeover Proposal and such Company Takeover Proposal or intended Company Takeover Proposal shall not have been unconditionally and irrevocably withdrawn by (x) the date that is 30 days prior to the Outside Date and thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) or (y) the date that is 10 business days prior to the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting and thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii); then, in each of clause (1) or clause (2) above, the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than the date of such termination, pay to Parent a fee of $7,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), payable by wire transfer of immediately available day funds; _provided, however_ , that no Termination Fee shall be payable to Parent pursuant to clause (2) of this sentence unless and until within 12 months of such termination the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into any definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates any Company Takeover Proposal, in which event the Termination Fee shall be payable upon the first to occur of such events. For purposes of this Section 6.06(b), the term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 5.02(e) except that references to "15%" shall be deemed references to "35%". The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 6.06(b) are an integral part of the 

        
  

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 6.06(b) as and
when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in
this Section 6.06(b), the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs
and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) as such costs and
expenses are incurred in connection with such suit together with interest on
the amounts set forth in this Section 6.06(b) at the prime rate of Citibank,
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

   

 SECTION 6.07 _Public Announcements_. Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties, the parties shall issue a joint press release announcing this Agreement and the Merger, which joint press release shall be prepared by Parent (and shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company). Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any other press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any securities exchange. 

  

 SECTION 6.08 _Affiliates_. Promptly following the date of execution of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all persons who are expected by the Company to be, at the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each such person to deliver to Parent at least 30 days prior to the Closing Date a written agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B. 

   

 SECTION 6.09 _Nasdaq Quotation_. Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Parent ADSs to be issued in the Merger to be approved for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Parent ADSs to be issued in the Merger to be quoted on the Nasdaq National Market from and after the Effective Time until the date that is 18 months after the Effective Time. 

  

 SECTION 6.10 _Rights Agreement; Consequences if Rights Triggered_. The Company Board shall take all action necessary and appropriate or otherwise requested in writing by Parent in order to render the Company Rights and the Company Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger and the other Transactions. Except as approved in writing in advance by Parent, the Company Board shall not (i) amend, modify or waive any provision of the Company Rights Agreement, (ii) redeem the Company Rights or (iii) take any action with respect to, or make any determination under, the Company Rights Agreement; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company Board may take any action in connection with the Company Rights Agreement that is specifically required by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction. If any Distribution Date, Shares Acquisition Date or Triggering Event occurs under the Company Rights Agreement at any time during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall make such adjustment to the Exchange Ratio as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree so as to preserve the economic benefits that the Company and Parent each reasonably expected on the date of this Agreement to receive as a result of the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions. 

  

 SECTION 6.11 _Tax Treatment_. The parties intend the Merger and the Share Exchange to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Each party and its affiliates shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Merger and the Share Exchange to so qualify and to obtain the opinion of their respective counsel, to the effect that the Merger and the Share Exchange will be treated for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a " _reorganization_ " within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, 

        
  

and that Parent, Sub and the Company will each be a party to that
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code, which opinion
shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit C and Exhibit D (the " _Tax
Opinions_ "). For purposes of the Tax Opinions, each of Parent and the Company
shall provide representation letters substantially in the form of Exhibit E
and Exhibit F, respectively, each dated on or about the date that is two
business days prior to the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
shareholders of the Company and reissued as of the Closing Date. Each of
Parent, the Company and each of their respective affiliates shall not take any
action and shall not fail to take any action or suffer to exist any condition
which action or failure to act or condition would prevent, or would be
reasonably likely to prevent, the Merger and the Share Exchange from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

  

 SECTION 6.12 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity, at its own expense, to participate in the defense and/or settlement of any litigation against or involving the Company, its directors and/or officers relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. 

  

 SECTION 6.13 _Company Convertible Notes; Company Warrants_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, in accordance with the terms of the Company Convertible Notes, to each Holder (as defined therein) no more than 15 days before nor more than 10 days after the Effective Time, the Change of Control Notice (as defined therein). In the event any Holder does not exercise its conversion rights under the Convertible Notes prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall issue and transfer to the Company Trust that number of shares of Company Common Stock (which at the Effective Time shall be converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c) into the right to receive Parent ADSs) as may be required to satisfy such conversion rights and the Company shall, promptly after the Effective Time, execute a supplemental agreement with Holders of the Company Convertible Notes that shall give effect to Section 3(f) of the Company Convertible Notes and permit such Company Convertible Notes to be convertible into the appropriate number of Parent ADSs. 

  

 (b) The Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, in accordance with the terms of the Company Warrants, to each Holder (as defined therein) no less than 20 days prior to the record date set by the Company in connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting, the notice required by Section 9(k) of the Company Warrants. In the event a Holder does not exercise its Company Warrants prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall issue and transfer to the Company Trust that number of shares of Company Common Stock (which at the Effective Time shall be converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c) into the right to receive Parent ADSs) as may be required to satisfy such exercise rights and the Company shall, promptly after the Effective Time, issue a replacement warrant in exchange for each Company Warrant, which shall give effect to Section 10 of the Company Warrants and permit such Company Warrants to be exercisable for the appropriate number of Parent ADSs. 

   

 SECTION 6.14 _Certain Obligations of Parent_. Certain obligations of Parent set forth in this Agreement, including those obligations designed to survive the consummation of the Share Exchange, may require additional corporate actions specified in the GSCL be taken by or with respect to Parent. As required by Law, certain of such obligations of Parent shall be incorporated in agreements in connection with the contribution-in-kind to Parent, which agreements shall be entered into by Parent, the Company and the Contribution Agent in the context of the Share Exchange pursuant to Section 202 _et seq_. of the GSCL. 

  

 SECTION 6.15 _Board Representation_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Parent Supervisory Board appoint William W. R. Elder, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, to the Parent Executive Board.

 SECTION 8.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval; _provided, however_ , that after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company or the shareholders of Parent without the further approval of such shareholders.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by either party without the prior written consent of the other party.

Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 SECTION 9.10 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.

 SECTION 9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.
