conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub
to commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(the " _Company Common Stock_ ") (which shares of the Company Common Stock
are hereinafter referred to as the " _Shares_ "), at a price per Share of

to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law;

 

WHEREAS, following the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing
as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_ "), in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), whereby
each issued and outstanding Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) will be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable net to the
holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required
by applicable Law, such Merger to be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of
the DGCL as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
(i) determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger and (iii) determined to recommend that the Companys stockholders

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has (i) determined that the

Merger; and

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that (i) this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with _Article VII_ , and (ii) all of the conditions set forth in
paragraphs (c)(i) through (c)(vi) of _Annex I_ shall then be satisfied (in the
case of (x) paragraphs (c)(ii) through (c)(v), giving effect only to
representations and warranties made as of dates prior to such time and (y)
paragraph (c)(vi), giving effect only to agreements and covenants that the
Company is required to comply with or to perform prior to such time) or
waived by Parent or Merger Sub, as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within ten Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall
(and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence, within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), the Offer to
purchase all the outstanding Shares at the Offer Price.

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction,
or waiver by Merger Sub, of the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment and
pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer as soon as practicable, but in any event no later than three Business
Days, after the Expiration Date. The Offer Price payable in respect of each
Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall
be paid net to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section
2.2(e)_.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions set forth in _Annex I_. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right
to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes

 



2  in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as previously
approved by the Company in writing, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall
not permit Merger Sub to, (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form
of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of
Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or waive the Minimum
Condition, (v) add any additional conditions to those set forth on _Annex I_
or amend any of the conditions and requirements to the Offer set forth in
_Annex I_ in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares, (vi) extend the
Expiration Date in a manner other than in accordance with this Agreement or
(vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in a
manner adverse to the holders of the Shares. 

(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is 20 Business
Days following the commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_
") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with
this Agreement, the date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial
Expiration Date, or such later date to which the Initial Expiration Date has
been extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "
_Expiration Date_ "). If on any then scheduled Expiration Date, all of the
conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions set forth in _Annex I_) have not been satisfied, or waived by
Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the
Offer for successive periods of up to ten Business Days each, the length of
each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion, in order
to permit the satisfaction of such conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Merger Sub shall not be required to, and shall not without the Companys
prior written consent, extend the Offer beyond August 20, 2015 (the " _Outside
Date_ "). In addition, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period or
periods required by applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations,
interpretations or positions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") or its staff.

 

(e) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VII_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article VII_, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) promptly, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate
the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this
Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Merger
Sub shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) return, and
shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in
accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

(f) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3
under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect
to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits, the "
_Schedule TO_"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary
advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements,
the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and Merger Sub agree to cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information

 



3  provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, and Parent and Merger Sub agree to promptly cause
the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due consideration to
the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the Company
and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company
and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of
any oral comments, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from
time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the
Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or
oral responses. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested by the Company and its counsel. The date and time at which Merger
Sub accepts for payment Shares tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Acceptance Time_."

(g) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares Merger Sub becomes obligated
to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) On the date of the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in a
manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall, subject to the provisions of
_Sections 5.4(d)-(f)_, contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company
shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9, in their entirety, copies of the
Fairness Opinions, together with summaries thereof in accordance with Item
1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (regardless of whether such
item is applicable). The Company consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of a description of the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company further agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree
to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the
Company agrees to promptly cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Except with respect to any
amendments filed after a Change of Board Recommendation (if there shall be
one) or in connection with any disclosures made in compliance with _Section
5.4(h)_: (i) Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and
the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel; (ii)
the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with copies of
any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the
Company or its counsel

 



4  may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or
oral responses; and (iii) Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel.

(b) Promptly after the date of this Agreement and otherwise from time to time
as requested by Merger Sub or its agents, the Company shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to Merger Sub mailing labels, security position listings, non-
objecting beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files
containing the names and addresses of the record or beneficial holders of the
Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish
Merger Sub with such information (including updated lists of holders of the
Shares and their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings
and non-objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as Merger
Sub or its agents may reasonably request in communicating with the record and
beneficial holders of Shares. The foregoing information shall constitute
Evaluation Material under the Confidentiality Agreement, and if this
Agreement shall be terminated, upon request of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or
control pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. In addition,
in connection with the Offer, unless there has been a Change of Board
Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause any third parties to, cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to
disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to any
Company Stock Plan or other Company Benefit Plan, and to permit such holders
of Shares to tender Shares in the Offer.

 

1.3 _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective
Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws shall
be amended and restated to be in the form of (except with respect to the name
of the Company) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of
Merger Sub and as amended shall be the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law, but in all events subject to _Section 5.9_
hereof.

 

(c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving

 



5  Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly elected,
designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall continue as the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

(d) The Merger shall be effected pursuant to, and governed by, Section 251(h)
of the DGCL. The parties agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to
cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer, without a meeting of stockholders of the
Company in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

(e) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds,
bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments
of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any
and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

1.4 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_.

 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place as soon as
practicable following the consummation of the Offer, at a time and date to be
specified by the Parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), such date to be no later
than the Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver
of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Cadwalader, Wickersham
and Taft LLP, One World Financial Center, New York, New York 10281, unless
another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the Parties.

(b) On the Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the Company may
agree to in writing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause an
appropriate certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of

6 ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash, without
interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary, and all Shares owned of record by Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect to such Shares.

 

(c) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(d) If, from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares
by reason of any stock split, division, or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted, but in no event shall the aggregate amount
of Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement be increased or
decreased due to such transaction.

 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as the paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for purposes of effecting the
payment of (i) the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger and (ii)
the Option Payment payable to Non-Employee Holders. At or promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of
Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement and
the aggregate Option Payments payable to Non-Employee Holders. Such funds
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole
discretion, pending payment by the Paying Agent to the holders 

 



7  of the Shares and the Non-Employee Holders. Earnings from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no part of such
earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares. In no event,
however, shall any such investment or any such payment of earnings delay the
receipt by former holders of Shares of the Merger Consideration or the receipt
by Non-Employee Holders of the Option Payment or otherwise impair such
holders rights hereunder. To the extent that there are any losses with
respect to any such investments or the fund diminishes for any reason below
the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the Merger
Consideration and Option Payment to all those entitled thereto, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the
cash in such fund so as to ensure that such fund is at all times maintained at
a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, which
Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at
the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify, and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and
in proper form, with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the
holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without
interest. Each Non-Employee Holder entitled to an Option Payment in accordance
with  _Section 2.4_ shall be entitled to receive such cash amount upon
delivery of a properly completed letter of transmittal, which shall be
provided to the Non-Employee Holders of Company Options at the same time
letters of transmittal are provided to holders of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_.

 



8 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following twelve months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (or Non-Employee
Holders of Company Options), and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to
look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares (or in the case of Non-Employee Holders of Company Options, the Option
Payment) and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with  _Section 2.2(e)_. If, prior to six years after the
Effective Time (or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any
payment would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (or Non-Employee Holders of
Company Options) has not complied with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ to
receive payment of the Merger Consideration (or in the case of Non-Employee
Holders of Company Options, the Option Payment) to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares (or in the case of Non-Employee Holders of Company Options, the
Option Payment) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, neither the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration (or in the case
of Non-Employee Holders of Company Options, the Option Payment) delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the relevant Offer Price, Merger Consideration or Option Payment
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or
Company Options, as applicable, such amounts that it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable state,
local or foreign Law, including with respect to stock transfer Taxes payable
by the holder. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Shares or Company Options, as applicable, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



9 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for
such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall
instead be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any
such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right
to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted,
as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section
2.2(e)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and to control all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demands, waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal in accordance with the DGCL or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

2.4 _Treatment of Company Options; Restricted Stock; Stock Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt
appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate
to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unexpired and
unexercised option to purchase Shares (the " _Company Options_ "), under any
stock plan of the Company, including the Amended and Restated Salix
Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.
2005 Stock Plan, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. 1996 Stock Option Plan or any
other plan, agreement or arrangement (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether
or not then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company
Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash (subject to any
applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_) of an amount equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Shares previously subject to such Company
Option and (ii) the

 



10  excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
Share previously subject to such Company Option (such amounts payable
hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Payments_ "). From and after the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Option Payment.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unvested Share subject to
forfeiture restrictions, repurchase rights or other restrictions under
the Company Stock Plans (" _Company Restricted Stock_ ") shall automatically
become fully vested and then shall be cancelled at the Effective Time, and in
exchange therefor, each former holder of such cancelled Company Restricted
Stock shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of
such Company Restricted Stock and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash
(subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable
Law to be withheld in accordance with _Section 2.2(e))_ equal to the per
share Merger Consideration.

(c) _Payments through Payroll_. Any payment to which a current or former
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company becomes entitled
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ shall be made through the Surviving
Corporations payroll as promptly as practicable, but no later than three
Business Days, following the Effective Time. Parent and Merger Sub shall
ensure that the Surviving Corporation has an amount in cash sufficient to pay
all amounts required by the foregoing sentence. Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay the payments under this _Section 2.4_ payable to holders who
are not current or former employees of the Company or any Subsidiary (" _Non-
Employee Holders_ ") in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_.

 

(d) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. After the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options or
other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder.

reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or prevent or materially delay consummation of

by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
bound or affected, except for any such investigations or charges, the
outcomes of which if determined adversely to the Company or any Company

Deductibility_. To the Companys knowledge (i) there has been no prohibited
transaction (within

 



19  the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and other
than a transaction that is exempt under a statutory or administrative
exemption) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that could result in
material liability to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, (ii) each Company
Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the
Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without liability (other than

termination event or (B) if the Company Benefit Plan is a pension benefit plan
subject to Part 2 of Title I of ERISA, liability for the accrued benefits as

pension plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) (" _Multiemployer Plan_ ")
or other pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate has sponsored or contributed to or been required to
contribute to a Multiemployer Plan or other pension plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA, and (ii) no material liability under Title IV of ERISA has been
incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in
full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate of incurring or being subject (whether primarily, jointly
or secondarily) to a material liability thereunder.

 

(g) _Change in Control_.

 

(i) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in connection with any other
event(s)), by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in

defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or former employee,

20  association under Section 501(a)(9) of the Code. The Company and each ERISA
Affiliate are in material compliance with (i) the requirements of the
applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and the regulations
(including proposed regulations) thereunder, and any similar state law and

Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations (including the
proposed regulations) thereunder. There has been no amendment to, announcement
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to, or change in
employee participation or coverage under, any Company Benefit Plan which
would materially increase the expense of maintaining such plan above the level
of the expense occurred therefor for the most recent plan year.

 

(i) _Section 409A/Deferred Compensation_. Each Company Benefit Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined under Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code) is in all material respects in documentary compliance
with, and has been operated and administered in all material respects in
compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued by the IRS
provided thereunder. No payment or benefit provided pursuant to any Company
Benefit Plan between the Company and any "service provider" (as such term is
defined in Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and IRS
guidance thereunder), including the grant, vesting or exercise of any Company
Option, will or may provide for the deferral of compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code, whether pursuant to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events) or otherwise. The Company is not a party to, or otherwise
obligated under, any Company Benefit Plan that provides for the gross-up,
indemnification or reimbursement of the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B)
of the Code. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either
alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events)
constitute an event under any Company Benefit Plan or Contract that will or
may result in any payment of deferred compensation which will not be in

all material respects in accordance with all applicable requirements and all
applicable Laws, (iii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax
treatment, the Foreign Plans meet all requirements for such treatment, (iv)

and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial
assumptions, (v) no material liability exists or reasonably could be imposed
upon the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary by reason of such
Foreign Plans and (vi) if required to be registered or approved by any
governmental entity or agency, has been so registered and approved.

or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
Company Benefit Plan, or shall limit the right of the Surviving Corporation or
any Company Subsidiary to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company
Benefit Plan following the Closing Date. In the event that (i) a party other
than Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their Subsidiaries

 



21  makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this
Agreement as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan, and (ii) such provision
is deemed to be an amendment to such Company Benefit Plan even though not
explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then such provision shall
lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect.

unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or
obligations for employees (other than routine payments to be made in the
normal course of business and consistent with past practice).

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event, such as termination of employment) will (i) result in any
payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation,
parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any director, employee or consultant
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or affiliate, or to any Governmental
Entity or other Person on behalf of any such director, employee or
consultant, from the Company or any Company Subsidiary or affiliate under any
Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits or
amounts otherwise payable, or result in any other material obligation under

under any Company Benefit Plan, (iv) limit or restrict the right of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or, after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent or any Company Subsidiaries, to
merge, amend, terminate or transfer the assets off any of the Company Benefit
Plans, (v) result in payments under any of the Company Benefit Plans that
would disqualify any amount from being qualified performance-based
compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code or (vi) result
in any material breach or other material violation of or under any employment
agreement, or any other labor-related agreement concerning the employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or to which any of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is party or by which such entity is bound.

(c) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or
instituted against any Company Benefit Plan, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the assets of any of
the trusts thereunder which would reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Department of Treasury, the Department of
Labor or any Multiemployer Plan. 

 



22 (d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise

owned by the Company (and, to the knowledge of the Company, with respect to
any other patents or patent applications included in the Registered
Intellectual Property) have been properly executed and have been or are

(b) _Ownership_. All of the Intellectual Property Rights and Technology
material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries currently owned
by, licensed to or in the control of the Company or a Company Subsidiary are
collectively referred to herein as the " _Material Intellectual Property_."
Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries exclusively owns
(beneficially, and of record where applicable) all right, title and interest
in and to the Material Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by
the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as applicable (the " _Owned Material
Intellectual Property_ "), free and clear of Liens (other than Permitted
Liens), and has a valid and enforceable right or license to use all other
Material Intellectual Property. The Owned Material Intellectual Property
is subsisting, and to the knowledge of the Company, valid and enforceable.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Owned Material Intellectual Property has
been: (i) developed by employees of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as
the case may be, within the scope of their employment who have assigned all
of their respective right, title and interest in and to such Material
Intellectual Property to the Company or a Company Subsidiary pursuant to
valid, enforceable written agreements; (ii) developed by independent
contractors who have assigned all of their respective right, title and
interest in and to such Material Intellectual Property to the Company or a
Company Subsidiary pursuant to valid, enforceable written agreements; or
(iii) otherwise acquired by the Company or a Company Subsidiary from a third
party who assigned all right,

 



26  title and interest in and to such Intellectual Property Rights and
Technology to the Company or such Company Subsidiary pursuant to a valid,
enforceable written agreement. The Material Intellectual Property constitutes
all of the Intellectual Property Rights used in or necessary for (A) the
respective businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as currently
conducted, and (B) the Company Products that are currently in clinical
development or being formulated, manufactured, marketed or sold by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, and, except as provided in the applicable Contracts
identified in _Section 3.4_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, such
Material Intellectual Property will be owned or available for use, following
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on the
same terms as they were owned or available for use by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.

(c) _Absence of Claims; Non-infringement_. No proceedings, claims, or actions
are pending against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, are threatened, that challenge the right of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to the use, validity,
registrability, enforceability or ownership of the Owned Material
Intellectual Property (or, to the knowledge of the Company, any other Material
Intellectual Property). No interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination,
inventorship challenges, nullity proceedings, inter partes reviews, post
grant reviews, covered business method reviews, derivation proceedings, or
other proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
in which the scope, validity, or enforceability of any of the Material
Intellectual Property owned by the Company is being contested or challenged.
To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Companys or any Company
Subsidiarys past nor present use of the Material Intellectual
Property, manufacture, offer for sale, sale, license, import or other
disposition of any Company Product, or other conduct of the business of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, infringes or misappropriates, violates or
otherwise conflicts with, or constitutes any contributory infringement,
inducement to infringement or misappropriation or violation of, the rights of
any other Person anywhere in the world. The Company has not received any
written notice, nor has there been any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation pending, or to the knowledge of the Company threatened
(including "cease and desist" letters and written invitations to take a patent
license), alleging the invalidity of, or limitation on, the Companys or any
Company Subsidiarys right to use, any of the Material Intellectual Property,
or the alleged infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any rights
of others by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries has asserted or threatened a claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (including "cease and desist" letters and
written invitations to take a patent license) against any third
party alleging infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Owned
Material Intellectual Property. No Person has notified the Company in writing
that it is claiming any ownership of or right to use any Owned Material
Intellectual Property, except as to those Intellectual Property Rights
jointly owned with another Person as set forth in _Section 3.17(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or pursuant to any Company Material Contracts
related to any joint venture or partnership agreements. Neither the Owned
Material Intellectual Property nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other
Material Intellectual Property is subject to any outstanding judgment, decree,
order, writ, award, injunction or determination of an arbitrator or court or
other Governmental Entity affecting the rights of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with respect thereto. To the knowledge of the Company, no Person is
currently interfering with, infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise
violating any of the Material Intellectual Property, and neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has made any claim alleging any of the
foregoing.

all maintenance and related fees due through the Closing Date have been paid,
and the Company and each Company Subsidiary has taken all other reasonable
actions required to maintain their validity and effectiveness. The Company and
each Company Subsidiary has taken appropriate and reasonable actions

nondisclosure agreements with officers, directors, subcontractors, employees,
licensees and customers in connection with its assets or the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to safeguard and maintain the secrecy and
confidentiality of Trade Secrets that are material to the business of the

1991) or for any other Company Regulatory Agency to invoke a similar policy.

similar action (including any correspondence questioning data integrity) as a
result of any action by the FDA, any other Company Regulatory Agency, or the

is in good

 



35  standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such

reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,

Agreement (immediately following its execution) by Parent as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub. This Agreement has been validly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub, and assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, examinership, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights

Agreement, or compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the provisions
of this Agreement will (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both): (a)
conflict with or violate any provision of the notice of articles, articles,
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or equivalent organizational or
governing documents of Parent or Merger Sub; (b) assuming that all consents,
approvals, authorizations and permits described in _Section 4.4_ have been
obtained and all filings and notifications described in _Section 4.4_ have
been made and any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired,

other Subsidiary of Parent (each a " _Parent Subsidiary_ " and, collectively,
the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ ") or any of their respective properties or
assets; or (c) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, require any
consent or approval under, violate, conflict with, result in any breach of or
any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a default under, or result in

of the respective properties or assets of Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent
Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract, permit or other instrument or obligation
to which Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or by which
they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected, except, with respect to clauses (b) and (c), for any such consent,
approval, conflict, violation, breach, loss, default, other occurrence or Lien
which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, (g) such filings as may be required under the rules and
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange or Toronto Stock Exchange, and (h)
where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits of, or to make such filings, registrations with or notifications to
any Governmental Entity or any other Person, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

 

4.5 _Litigation_.

(a) There is no suit, claim, action, proceeding, hearing, investigation or
arbitration pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against or
affecting Parent or Merger Sub that, individually or in the aggregate, has had

4.6 _Information in the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9_. The
information supplied by Parent expressly for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule 14D-9 (and any amendment or supplement) will not,
when filed with the SEC, when distributed or disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, and at the Expiration Date, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated or
necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Offer Documents
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and any other applicable federal securities laws and will not,
when filed with the SEC, when distributed or disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, and at the Expiration Date, contain any untrue statement of a

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that Parent
and Merger Sub make no representation or warranty with respect to statements
made in the Offer Documents based on information furnished by the Company in
writing expressly for inclusion therein.

 



37 4.7 _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is,
nor at any time during the last three years has been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than
as contemplated by this Agreement).

 

4.8 _Sufficient Funds_. Parent and Merger Sub (directly or through one or more

(ii) consummate the Merger at the Closing, (iii) otherwise perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement and (iv) pay any fees, expenses
or other amounts payable by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Intended Purposes_ "). Parent and Merger Sub have provided to the Company a
true and complete copy of a fully executed commitment letter, dated as of the
date hereof (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements,
amendments and joinders thereto, collectively, the " _Commitment Letter_ "),
from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") and the
executed fee letter relating thereto (provided that the fee amounts, pricing
caps and other economic terms, and the rates and amounts included in the
"market flex" provisions (but not covenants), may be redacted, none of which
redacted provisions could adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability,
termination or amount of the Debt Financing) (including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes, supplements, amendments and joinders thereto,
collectively, the " _Fee Letter_ "). Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Lenders have committed to
provide Guarantor and Parent with the amounts set forth in the Commitment
Letter (the " _Debt Financing_ ") for purposes of financing the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the
date hereof, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Guarantor and Parent, and to the
knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, the Lenders, enforceable in accordance
with its terms (except that (x) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, examinership, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to
creditors rights generally and (y) equitable remedies of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought). As of the date hereof, other than the
Commitment Letter, none of Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub has entered into
any side letters, Contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which any Person
has the right to amend, restate or otherwise modify the Commitment Letter in a
manner that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability
at the Acceptance Time or the Closing of the Debt Financing. Except as set
forth in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, there are no conditions or
contingencies (including pursuant to any "market flex" provisions in the Fee
Letter) to funding the Debt Financing under the Commitment Letter in an amount
necessary, when taken together with other funds available to Parent and Merger
Sub to fund the Intended Purposes, and the Commitment Letter has not been
amended, restated or otherwise modified in any manner prior to the date hereof
and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have not
been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect prior to the
date hereof. The Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, the engagement letter and
fee credit letter related thereto constitute the entire and complete agreement
between the parties thereto with respect to the Debt Financing. As of the date
hereof, (i) assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Article III_ , no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute (A) a default or breach by Guarantor
or Parent under any term of, or (B) a failure to satisfy any condition by
Guarantor or

 



38  Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, any Lender under, the
Commitment Letter and (ii) assuming the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition
and the satisfaction, or waiver by the Merger Sub, of the other conditions
set forth in _Annex I_ , neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to
believe that (x) any condition or contingency related to the funding of the
full amount of the Debt Financing will not be satisfied at the Acceptance
Time or (y) the full amount of the Debt Financing will not be available to
Guarantor and Parent at the Acceptance Time. Guarantor or Parent has fully
paid, or caused to be paid, any and all commitment or other fees required by
the Commitment Letter on or prior to the date hereof.

4.9 _Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities_.

 

(a) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with its
incorporation or organization and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the Closing Date have
incurred, directly or indirectly, through any Subsidiary or affiliate, any
obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type
or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any
Person.

4.10 _Brokers_. The Company will not be responsible for any brokerage,
finders, financial advisors or other fee or commission payable in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by and on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its
respective controlled affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and to obtain the Debt Financing
on or prior to the Acceptance Time on the terms and conditions described in
the Commitment Letter (including the exercise of any "market flex" provisions
in the Fee Letter) and shall not permit any amendment, supplement,
modification or replacement to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
any of its rights under, the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements
without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), if such amendment, supplement,
modification, replacement or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate cash amount of
proceeds of the Debt Financing to an amount below the amount (that when
combined with the liquidity Parent then contemplates to be, and which is
available to be, applied thereto) required to consummate the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to repay or

expands upon, amends, supplements or otherwise modifies any of the conditions
set forth in the Commitment Letter on the date hereof in a manner that would

Financing less likely to be timely obtained (or the conditions to obtaining
the Debt Financing less likely to be timely satisfied), (iii) prevents,
materially impedes or materially delays the Closing, (iv) adversely impacts
the ability of either Parent or Guarantor to enforce its rights against any
other parties to the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements in any
material respect or (v) materially adversely impacts the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the Offer at the Acceptance Time, the Merger at the
Closing or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub may amend, supplement, modify or
replace the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, in each case as in effect at
the date hereto, or the Definitive Agreements, but only if any such
amendment, supplement, modification or replacement is not inconsistent with
the immediately preceding sentence, (w) to add or replace lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities which had not
executed the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter as of the date hereof, (x)
to increase the amount of indebtedness, (y) to add or replace facilities with
one or more new facilities or (z) otherwise in a manner not less favorable

the term " _Debt Financing_ " shall be deemed to include the Debt Financing,
as amended, modified or replaced pursuant to this  _Section 5.2(a)_ and (2)
the term " _Commitment Letter_ " shall be deemed to include the Commitment
Letter as it may be amended, supplemented, modified or replaced pursuant to

necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and to obtain the Debt Financing
on or prior to the Acceptance Time on the terms and conditions described in
the Commitment Letter (including the exercise of any "market flex" provisions
in the Fee Letter), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with
the terms and conditions of, and maintain in effect, the Commitment Letter
pursuant to its terms (except for amendments, supplements, modifications and
replacements made in compliance with _Section 5.2(a)_), (ii) negotiate and
enter into, at or prior to the Acceptance Time, definitive agreements (such
definitive agreements, the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") with respect to the
Debt Financing (and promptly upon the execution and delivery thereof, provide
true and complete copies of the Definitive Agreements to the Company) on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter (including, if
necessary, the exercise of "market flex" provisions in the Fee Letter) or on
other terms and conditions that would not, if such other terms and conditions
constituted an amendment to the Definitive Agreements, be inconsistent with
_Section 5.2(a)_, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or, if deemed advisable by
Guarantor, seek a waiver on a timely basis of) all conditions and covenants
applicable to Guarantor and Parent to the funding of the Debt Financing set
forth in the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements and (iv) if all
conditions to the Debt Financing are, or upon funding of the Debt Financing
will be, satisfied, cause the Financing Sources to comply with their
obligations under the Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements and to
fund at or prior to the Acceptance Time, the Debt Financing required to
consummate the Offer at the Acceptance Time, the Merger at the Closing and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if
necessary, enforcing its rights under the Commitment Letter and the Definitive
Agreements, provided however, under no circumstances shall Parent or
Guarantor be required to commence or sustain legal proceedings in connection
therewith.

(c) In the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable and such portion is reasonably required to consummate the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
Guarantor and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and
timely obtain substitute financing (on terms and conditions that are not
materially less favorable to Guarantor and Parent, taken as a whole, than the
terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter relating to the Debt
Financing to be replaced, taking into account the "market flex" provisions
thereof) from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Substitute Financing_ ") (and shall promptly upon the
execution and delivery thereof, provide to the Company true and complete
copies of the material, definitive documents related to the Substitute
Financing (provided that, with respect to any fee letters, the fee amounts,
pricing caps and other economic terms, and the rates and amounts included in
the "market flex" provisions (but not covenants), may be redacted). All
references to the term " _Debt Financing_ " shall be deemed to include such
Substitute Financing and all references to the " _Commitment Letter_ ," the "
_Fee Letter_ " and " _Definitive Agreements_ " shall include the applicable
documents for the Substitute Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt
written notice of any (i) material breach by any party to the Commitment
Letter or the Definitive Agreements of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes
aware or (ii) receipt by it of any written notice from any the Lenders or any
other Financing Sources with respect to any actual or threatened withdrawal,
repudiation or termination of the Debt Financing by the Lenders or any other
Financing Sources. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of the efforts of Guarantor and Parent to arrange and obtain the Debt
Financing.

 



44 (d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its directors, officers,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and other
representatives (collectively, " _Company Representatives_ ") to, provide to
Parent and Merger Sub such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by
Parent that is reasonably necessary or customary, proper or advisable in

Financing (the " _Bond Financing_ ", and together with the Debt Financing,
the " _Financing_ "), including (i) causing the Company Representatives to

connection with the Financing, (viii) cooperating reasonably with the
Financing Sources due diligence, to the extent reasonable and customary, (ix)

45  the Closing of the Companys 6.00% Senior Notes due 2021, and the release of
related liens); _provided_ that the effectiveness of any definitive
documentation executed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
subject to the consummation of the Merger, (x) taking all actions reasonably
necessary to permit the prospective Persons involved in the Financing to
evaluate the Company, including the Companys current assets, cash management

purposes of establishing collateral arrangements, in each case, upon
reasonable advance notice and at times and locations to be agreed, (xi)
using reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers, consents, estoppels and

documentation and other information required by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money

amended, that has been reasonably requested not less than ten days prior to
the Closing Date and (xvi) using its reasonable best efforts to take all
actions necessary to permit the consummation of the Financing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.2(d)_ shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would (A) require the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or
expenses, or make any payment in connection with the Financing, prior to the
occurrence of the Closing (except to the extent Parent promptly reimburses
(in the case of ordinary course out-of-pocket costs and expenses) or provides
the funding (in all other cases) to the Company or such Company Subsidiary
therefor), or incur any liability in connection with the Financing that is
effective prior to the occurrence of the Closing, or (B) require the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any instrument or Contract,
or agree to any change or modification to any instrument or Contract, that
is effective prior to the Closing or that would be effective if the Closing
does not occur. The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to periodically update any
Required Information in order to ensure that the Required Information does
not, when furnished and taken as a whole, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact, in each case with respect to
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, necessary in order to make the
Required Information, in light of the circumstances under which the statements
contained in the Required Information are made, not misleading. The Company
consents to the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection
with the Financing in a manner customary for such financing transactions;
_provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries.

(e) Parent shall promptly (i) upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out of pocket costs (including reasonable outside
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
Company Representatives in connection with the cooperation of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives contemplated by this
_Section 5.2_ and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless

 



46  the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives from
and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with any claims asserted by the Lenders or any of the other
Financing Sources in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (other
than to the extent such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties arise from the willful
misconduct or breach of this _Section 5.2_ by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any Company Representative) and any information used in
connection therewith (other than (x) arising from fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, misstatements or omissions on the part of the Company or
its affiliates or (y) written historical information of the type prepared by
the Company or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business that is
provided by the Company or any of its affiliates). All non-public or other
confidential information provided by the Company to Parent, Parent
Representatives or its Financing Sources pursuant to this _Section 5.2_
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
each of Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parents
and Merger Subs obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon
Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the Financing, any Substitute Financing or any
other financing. The failure, for any reason, of Parent or Merger Sub to have
sufficient cash available at the Acceptance Time to pay the consideration in
the Offer in accordance with the Offer and this Agreement or at the Closing
to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement or the
failure to so pay the consideration in the Offer at the Acceptance Time in
accordance with the Offer and this Agreement or the Merger Consideration at
the Closing in accordance with this Agreement, in each case, shall constitute
a breach of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub.

(g) Prior to or at the Closing, the Company shall deliver an executed payoff
letter (the " _Debt Payoff Letter_ ") in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent for the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 2, 2014,
by and among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto from time to
time and Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent,
and the other agents party thereto (the " _Credit Agreement_ "). The Debt
Payoff Letter shall (A) confirm the full outstanding amount then outstanding,
along with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the
Company accrued under the Credit Agreement, (B) contain payment instructions
and (C) evidence the satisfaction, release and discharge of the debt and
liabilities under the Credit Agreement and the agreement by such lenders to
release all Liens upon the payment of such amount in accordance with the
payment instructions. Prior to or at the Closing, the Company shall have
obtained documents, including an authorization to file UCC termination
statements upon such payment, executed terminations and releases of
outstanding mortgages, as are reasonably necessary to release such Liens. The
Company shall cooperate with Parent, upon Parents reasonable request, so that
the Companys 6.00% Senior Notes due 2021 may be satisfied and discharged at
Closing, it being understood that (i) Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited (including by means of the Company at Closing) the funds needed to
satisfy and discharge such Notes, (ii) the Company shall not be required to
deliver any notice of redemption to the Trustee or holders of such Notes
prior to the Closing, and (iii) the Company shall not be required to take any
action, to the extent it determines, after consultation with outside counsel,
that such action would reasonably be likely to violate the terms of any
Contract (including without limitation, the Companys outstanding
indebtedness).

 



47 5.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time and subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
and each of their respective Company Representatives to: (i) provide to Parent
and Merger Sub and their respective officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and other
representatives (collectively, the " _Parent Representatives_ ") access at
reasonable times upon prior reasonable notice to the officers, employees,
agents, properties, offices and other facilities of such party and its
Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof (including Tax Returns) and
(ii) furnish promptly such information concerning the business, properties,
contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of such Party and
its Subsidiaries as Parent or the Parent Representatives may reasonably
request; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to provide any
information relating to the negotiation or prosecution of this Agreement. None
of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative shall be
required to provide access to or disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall inform Parent of
the general nature of the information being withheld and the Parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of this sentence apply.

(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_
or otherwise under this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall comply with,
and shall cause the Parent Representatives to comply with, all of their
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, dated January 20, 2015, by
and between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which shall remain in full force and effect and is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(c) The Company shall provide Parent with a draft of its proposed Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and as reasonably far
in advance of (and in any event at least five Business Days prior to) the
filing thereof with the SEC. The Company shall give Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review any material changes thereto before it is
filed with the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable comments provided by Parent.

 

5.4 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.4(b)_, from and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VII_, the Company shall not, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of
providing information) or facilitate the submission of any inquiries,
proposals or offers or any other efforts or attempts that constitute, or would
reasonably be

 



48  expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions
or negotiations or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in or
facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions or
negotiations, (ii) furnish to any Person any nonpublic information in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or
propose publicly to withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (v) enter
into any merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share
purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or enter
into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach
its obligations hereunder, or (vi) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing (any action or failure to act set forth in the foregoing clauses
(iii) or (iv), a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ "). The Company shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussion or
negotiation with any Persons conducted theretofore by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any Company Representatives with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and request to be returned or destroyed all confidential information
provided by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to such
Person.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(a)_,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Acceptance Time (i) the Company has received an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal from a third party, (ii)(A) such Acquisition Proposal
(or any precursor thereto) did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.4_
and the Company has complied with the terms of this _Section 5.4_ in all
respects with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (and any precursor
thereto) and (B) the Company has not breached this _Section 5.4_ in any
material respect, (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation
(which Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge includes the Company Financial
Advisors) and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (iv) after
consultation with its outside counsel, the Company Board determines in good
faith that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law,
then the Company and the Company Representatives may (A) furnish information
with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that the Company (x) will not, and will not allow the
Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to, disclose
any nonpublic information to such Person without first entering into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) will promptly (and in no event
later than 24 hours after providing such information) provide to Parent any
information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided to
such other Person not previously provided to Parent.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent in the event that the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company
Representative receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal or indication by any
Person that it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
request for non-public information relating to the Company or any

 



49  Company Subsidiary other than requests for information unrelated to an
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify
Parent promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) of the identity of such
Person and provide Parent a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, indication,
inquiry or request (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably
detailed description of such Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or
request), including any modifications thereto. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event at Parents request
and otherwise no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any changes,
developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any Acquisition
Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (including the terms and conditions
thereof and of any modification thereto), and any material developments,
discussions and negotiations. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in
writing if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in
discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
_Section 5.4(b)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(a)_,
but subject to _Section 5.4(f)_, if the Company receives an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, after giving effect to all of the adjustments
to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent (including
pursuant to clause (ii) of  _Section 5.4(f)_ below), and so long as (A) such
Acquisition Proposal (and any precursor thereto) did not result from a breach
of this _Section 5.4_ and the Company has complied with the terms of this
_Section 5.4_ in all respects with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (and
any precursor thereto) and (B) the Company has not breached this _Section
5.4_ in any material respect, the Company Board may at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, if it determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law,
(x) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior
Proposal and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y)
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently
with such termination the Company pays or causes to be paid to Parent the
Termination Fee and otherwise complies with the provisions of _Section
7.1(e)_ and _Section 7.2_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(a)_,
but subject to _Section 5.4(f)_, the Company Board may, at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time, effect a Change of Board Recommendation for a reason
unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of
material facts, events or circumstances that have arisen or occurred after the
date of this Agreement that were not known by or reasonably foreseeable to the
Company or the Company Board prior to the date hereof, other than (i)
changes in the market price or trading volume of the Shares (however, the
underlying reasons for such changes may constitute an Intervening Event), (ii)
the timing of any consents, registrations, approvals, permits, clearances or
authorizations required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time by the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions

 



50  contemplated hereby, (iii) an Acquisition Proposal, or an inquiry, proposal
or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
or the consequences thereof, (iv) the fact that, in and of itself, the
Company exceeds any internal or published industry analyst projections or
forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings (however, the underlying
reasons for such events may constitute an Intervening Event) or (v) events
set forth on _Section 5.4(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (an "
_Intervening Event_ "), failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

(f) The Company Board may not withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant to clause (x) of
_Section 5.4(d)_ or _Section 5.4(e)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
clause (y) of _Section 5.4(d)_ unless (A) in the case of actions taken in
relation to a Superior Proposal, (1) such Superior Proposal (and any
precursor thereto) did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.4_ and the
Company has complied with the terms of this _Section 5.4_ in all respects
with respect to such Superior Proposal (and any precursor thereto) and (2)
the Company has not breached this _Section 5.4_ in any material respect, and
(B) whether or not such action relates to a Superior Proposal:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to
take such action, which notice shall specify (A) if such action is to be taken
in relation to a Superior Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal
and other material documents, including the definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (B)
if such action is to be taken in relation to an Intervening Event, a
reasonably detailed description of the underlying facts giving rise to,
and the reasons for taking, such action; and

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that (A) if such action is to be
taken in relation to a Superior Proposal, the Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal or (B) if such action is to be taken in
relation to an Intervening Event, the need for making a Change of Board
Recommendation is obviated.

In the event of any revisions to the Superior Proposal or material
developments in an Intervening Event, the Company shall be required to deliver
a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 5.4(f)_ with respect to such new written notice; _provided_ that
the Notice Period shall be two Business Days in respect of such revisions.

(g) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 5.4_ by any of the Company Representatives shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Agreement (including this _Section 5.4_) by the Company.

 



51 (h) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company Board from disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 

(i) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from responding to any unsolicited proposal or
inquiry solely by (i) advising the Person making such proposal or inquiry of
the terms of this _Section 5.4_ or (ii) seeking to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof.

 

5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of the
Company Representatives (in the case of the Company) and each of the Parent
Representatives (in the case of Parent and Merger Sub) to, (i) take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and cooperate with
the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Offer, the
Merger and each of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, (ii) take, or cause
to be taken, all actions consistent with this _Section 5.5(a)_ necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the
HSR Act (including any extensions thereof) as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, (iii) cause each of the conditions to the Offer set
forth in _Annex I_ and each of the conditions to the Merger set forth in
_Section 6.1_ to be satisfied as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, (iv) obtain, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, from any Governmental Entities, and maintain, any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to
be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
or to avoid or resolve any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity
(including those in connection with the HSR Act or any other antitrust or
competition Law), in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, (v) as promptly as

under the HSR Act, and (vi) as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, make all necessary filings (and thereafter make any other required
submissions and supply any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested by any Governmental Entity), and pay any fees due in
connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger
required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state
securities Laws, and (B) any other applicable Law, including any other
antitrust or competition Law; _provided_ , that each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the other Parties in connection with (x)
preparing and filing the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and any Other
Filings, (y) determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is required, in connection with the consummation
of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (z) seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers or making any such filings. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly furnish to each other all information required for any application
or other filing under the rules and regulations of any applicable Law in
connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



52 (b) At Parents request, the Company shall give (or shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause the
Company Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to obtain any third
party consents, approvals or waivers required to be obtained under Company
Material Contracts or other Contracts in connection with consummation of the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall coordinate and cooperate with Parent in
determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required
to be obtained from parties to any Company Material Contracts in connection
with consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiaries shall pay any consideration or make any
agreements or commitments in connection with any such consents, approvals or
waivers without the prior written consent of Parent.

(c) Parent shall, on behalf of the Parties, control and lead all
communications with any Governmental Entity relating to antitrust or other
competition Laws, and determine and direct the strategy and process by which
the Parties will seek required approvals relating to antitrust and other
competition Laws, subject to good faith consultations with the Company and
its compliance with this _Section 5.5_. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, Parent shall consult with the Company and consider in good
faith the views of the Company prior to proposing, negotiating, or entering
into any agreement, undertaking or understanding (whether oral or written)
with any Governmental Entity relating to any antitrust or other competition
Laws, provided that the final determination as to the appropriate course of
action shall be made by Parent. In the event that the Parties do not agree
with respect to any matter in connection with seeking required approvals
relating to antitrust or other competition Laws, subject to and without
limiting in any respect the Parties obligations in this _Section 5.5_,
Parents decision will control.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party shall:
(i) give the other Parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) keep the other Parties
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or legal proceeding and (iii) promptly inform the other Parties of
any communication to or from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of
Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Offer, the Merger or

appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may
be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each Party
will permit authorized representatives of the other Parties to be present at
each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or legal proceeding.

 



53 (e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, take any and all steps necessary to avoid
and eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust or competition Law
that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any other Person so as to
enable the Parties to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement (but in any event not later than the Outside Date),
including proposing, negotiating, effecting and agreeing to, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any sale, divestiture, license,
holding separate or other similar arrangement with respect to, or
other disposition of or restriction on, any or all of Parents or the
Companys respective businesses, product lines, divisions or assets or
interests therein, and taking such action or actions that would in the
aggregate have a similar effect, including agreeing to change or modify, and
changing or modifying, any course of conduct regarding their respective future
operations or otherwise taking actions that would limit their respective
freedom of action with respect to, or ability to retain, one or more of their
respective businesses, product lines, divisions or assets or interests
therein. Parent shall take any and all actions necessary in order to ensure
that (x) no requirement for non-action, a waiver, consent or approval of the
United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice, any State Attorney General or other Governmental
Entity, (y) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or
any other order in any suit or proceeding, and (z) no other matter relating to
any antitrust or competition Law, would preclude satisfaction of the Offer
conditions by the Outside Date. The Company shall agree if, but solely if,
requested by Parent so as to permit the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or the receipt of any other
approval or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period
under any other antitrust or competition Law, in each case as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in any event not later than
necessary to satisfy the HSR Condition in _Annex I_ at least three Business
Days prior to the Expiration Date), to effect and agree to any sale,
divestiture, license, holding separate or other similar arrangement with
respect to, or other disposition of or restriction on, any of its businesses,
product lines, divisions or assets or interests therein, and take such action
or actions that would in the aggregate have a similar effect; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such sale, divestiture, license, holding separate or
other similar arrangement, disposition, restriction or action or actions is
conditioned on the occurrence of, and shall become effective only from and
after, the Effective Time.

(f) Parent shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, acquire, purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire,
purchase, lease or license), by merging with or into or consolidating with, or
by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division or part thereof, or any securities or
collection of assets, if doing so would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose
any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of
not obtaining, any consent, approval or exemption of any Governmental Entity
necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under applicable Law; (ii) materially increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity entering any judgment, decree, injunction or
other order prohibiting the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) materially increase the
risk of not being able to remove any such judgment, decree, injunction or
other order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) restrict, prevent, prohibit,
impede or delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



54 (g) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
any litigation or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
commenced, threatened or is reasonably foreseeable that seeks, or would
reasonably be expected to seek, to restrict, prevent, prohibit, impede or
delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to take all actions, and do all things
necessary, proper or advisable, and cooperate with each other, to contest and
resist any such litigation, action or proceeding, including through litigation
on the merits and appeal, and to, as applicable, avoid the entry of, or have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that restricts, prevents, prohibits, impedes or would have the effect of
delaying the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in any case as promptly as
practicable and in any event no later than necessary to satisfy the HSR
Condition in _Annex I_ at least three Business Days prior to the
Outside Date. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the
event that any such litigation, action or proceeding is commenced against
Parent or the Company (or any of their respective directors or Subsidiaries),
or any such litigation, action or proceeding is, to the knowledge of Parent
or the Company, as the case may be, threatened or reasonably foreseeable,
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other
Party thereof in writing and shall provide the other Party with such updates
and such information as the other Party shall reasonably request with respect
to such litigation, action or proceeding, and the status thereof, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to disclose
any information if such disclosure would, in the opinion of its outside
counsel, jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege; _provided_
_further_ that the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to enable such
information to be furnished or made available to the other Party without
jeopardizing privilege, including by entering into a customary joint defense
agreement or common interest agreement.

 

(h) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall provide such information and execute such
further instruments and written assurances as may be reasonably requested by
the other Parties and assist and cooperate with the other Parties, in each
case in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, in order to carry
into effect the intents and purposes of, and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement.

 

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the
other Party of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would
be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any Party to effect the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not
to be satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
Party to effect the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction

 



55  contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not cure
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to the Party receiving such notice. The failure to deliver any
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not affect any of the conditions
to the Offer or the Merger or give rise to any right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_.

 

5.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the
press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall
be a joint release of, and shall not be issued prior to the approval of each
of, the Company and Parent. All formal written communications to the officers
or employees of the Company and any Company Subsidiaries pertaining
to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to Parents prior consent (not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Company shall provide Parent with
a copy of the intended communication, and Parent shall have a reasonable
period of time to review and comment on each such communication (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any group oral presentations with respect
to the above shall be materially consistent with such formal written
communications.

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.8_, (i) the term " _Company Employees_ "
shall mean employees who are actively employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries at the Effective Time and who remain employed by Parent or a
Subsidiary thereof following the Closing Date, and (ii) the term "
_Continuation Period_ " shall mean the period beginning at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time. For the
Continuation Period, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, to each Company Employee, compensation and benefits
that are no less favorable in the aggregate to either those compensation and
benefits that are generally made available by the Company to such Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time or to similarly situated
employees of Parent, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion. Except
as expressly provided herein, nothing herein is intended to limit the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to (i) terminate the employment of any
Company Employee at any time, (ii) change or modify any incentive
compensation or employee benefit plan or arrangement at any time and in any
manner, or (iii) change or modify the terms or conditions of employment for
any of their employees.

 

(b) With respect to any compensation or benefit plans sponsored by Parent or
its affiliates (each a " _Parent Benefit Plan_ ") in which any Company
Employee who remains employed by Parent or a Subsidiary thereof will
participate effective as of or after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to (i)
waive all preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to any Company Employee
under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare plan to the extent they were
inapplicable to, or satisfied under, the Company Benefit Plans in which any
such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cause
the eligible expenses incurred by each Company Employee under any Company
Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year ending on the Closing Date
to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements under the

 



56  corresponding Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare plan, to the extent that
such employee would have received credit for such co-payment or deductible
under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which the applicable employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) recognize the
service of each Company Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit
accruals) under each Parent Benefit Plan in which Company Employees are
eligible to participate after the Effective Time to the same extent such
service was credited under the Company Benefit Plans (except to the extent
such service credit will result in the duplication of benefits).

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Company Employee
who terminates employment during the period beginning on the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary thereof shall be entitled to severance pay
and benefits no less favorable in the aggregate than the severance pay and
benefits such Company Employee would have been entitled to pursuant to the
severance plans and arrangements set forth on _Section 5.8(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule had such termination of employment occurred immediately
prior to the Effective Time. 

(d) With respect to each Company Employee with an employment agreement
identified on _Section 3.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent
agrees to honor or cause to be honored the terms of each such employment
agreement through the expiration, modification or termination of such
agreements in conformity with applicable Law.

 

(e) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this _Section 5.8_ with respect to employees are
included for the sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and
shall not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any other Person,
including any Company Employees, former employees, any participant in any
Company Benefit Plan or any beneficiary or dependent thereof. The Company,
Parent and Merger Sub further acknowledge and agree that no provisions of this
Agreement (including the provisions contained in this _Section 5.8)_ shall
(i) be construed to (x) establish, amend, or modify a Company Benefit Plan or
any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement (including any
Parent Benefit Plan), (y) require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
continue or amend any Company Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or any other
particular benefit plan after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (z) prevent or limit Parent from terminating
or modifying any Parent Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan or other employee
benefit plan that Parent may establish or maintain (in accordance with its
respective terms) or (ii) require Parent to continue or maintain the
employment of any Company Employee following the Closing Date.

5.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights to
advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of any Person who is or prior
to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of
the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors as provided
in the Company Certificate, the

 



57  Company Bylaws, the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or
any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof (i) shall
survive the Merger, (ii) shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms with respect to any claims against any such Person arising
out of such acts or omissions and (iii) shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Person. Parent shall ensure that the Surviving
Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.

 

(b) Without limiting _Section 5.9(a)_ or any rights of any individual who is
a member of the Company Board or an officer of the Company as of the date
hereof, or who becomes a member of the Company Board or an officer of the
Company prior to the Effective Time (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), pursuant to
any indemnification agreement, from and after the acceptance for payment of,
and payment by Merger Sub for, any Shares pursuant to the Offer, in the event
of any threatened or actual action, suit, claim, proceeding, investigation, or
arbitration (each an " _Indemnified Proceeding_ "), whether civil, criminal
or administrative, by reason of (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with
respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors, or is or was
serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another Person or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each such
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any Indemnified Proceeding to each Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law upon receipt of any
undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or actual Indemnified
Proceeding. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this  _Section 5.9_, upon learning of any such Indemnified Proceeding, shall
promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified
Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
indemnifying party. In the event of any such Indemnified Proceeding (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for
any legal expenses of other counsel subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor
are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only
one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the
use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel
with a conflict of interest, _provided_ that the fewest number of counsels
necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter at Parents or the
Surviving Corporations expense;

 



58  and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and nonappealable, that the indemnification of such Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.
Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this _Section
5.9(b)_ shall continue in full force and effect for the period beginning upon
the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any Shares
pursuant to the Offer and ending six years from the Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
Indemnified Proceeding asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the final disposition of such Indemnified Proceeding.

 

(c) For the period beginning upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment
by Merger Sub for, any Shares pursuant to the Offer and ending six years
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain for the benefit of each
Indemnified Party an insurance and indemnification policy that provides
coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO
Insurance_") that contains terms (including with respect to coverage and
amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions)
that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any
Indemnified Party than those of the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policies in effect on the date of this Agreement or, if
such insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required
to pay a premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ ");
_provided_ _further_ that if the amount of annual premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such six-year
period the most advantageous policy available for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall
be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by
the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors
and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the
Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect and comply
with all obligations thereunder.

(d) The obligations under this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without
the written consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 5.9_).

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves or liquidates the Surviving
Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision
to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 



59 5.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition", "fair price",
"business combination" or other anti-takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the Offer, or the Merger,
including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company Board
shall take all action necessary to render such Law inapplicable to the
foregoing.

 

5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition
by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered Person of the
Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Shares or Company Options
pursuant to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

 

5.12 _Rule 14d10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
(acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) will take
all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries on or
after the date of this Agreement with any of its officers, directors
or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer,
director or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance
or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d10(d)(1)
under the Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive
safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d10(d) under the Exchange Act. Promptly upon
Parent or any of its affiliates entering into any such arrangement with any
current or future director, officer or employee of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, Parent will provide to the Company any and all
information concerning such arrangements as may be needed by the Company to
comply with this  _Section 5.12_.

5.13 _Company Convertible Debt_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action
to enter into one or more supplemental indentures, executed and delivered to
the Trustee at or prior to the Effective Time and satisfactory in form and
substance to the Trustee (as defined in each of the indentures under which
each series of notes of Company Convertible Debt (each, a " _Convertible
Senior Note_ ") was issued (the " _Indentures_ ")), to each Indenture to
provide for the conversion and settlement of the Convertible Senior Notes
following the Effective Time, as set forth in the respective Indentures
governing the conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes issued thereunder
(including any applicable increase in the "Conversion Rate" thereunder in
connection with the Offer and the Merger) and changes to the consideration
deliverable to holders upon conversion thereof, if, with respect to either
Indenture, any Convertible Senior Notes issued thereunder will remain
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as
may be required in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of the
applicable Indenture or under applicable Law, including, without limitation,
the giving of any notices that may be

 



60  required in connection with the Offer and the Merger and any repurchases or
conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes occurring as a result of or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constituting
a "Fundamental Change" and/or "Make-Whole Fundamental Change" as such terms
are defined in the respective Indentures, and the delivery of any supplemental
indentures, legal opinions, officers certificates or other documents or
instruments required in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the
consummation thereof.

 

(c) The Company shall deliver drafts of all notices, certificates, press
releases, supplemental indentures, legal opinions, officers certificates or
other documents or instruments deliverable pursuant to or in connection with
the Indentures or under applicable Law to Parent prior to the delivery,
issuance or filing thereof by or on behalf of the Company, and shall cooperate
in good faith with Parent to reflect any comments by Parent and to respond to
any questions by Parent with respect thereto. The Company shall not amend,
supplement , modify or waive the terms of the Indentures without the prior
written consent of Parent.

5.14 _Company Hedging Transactions and Warrants._ The Company shall cooperate
with Parent at Parents request in connection with any discussions,
negotiations or agreements with the counterparties to the Company Hedging
Transactions or the Warrants, any of their respective affiliates or any other
Person with respect to any determination or computation in connection with
the Company Hedging Transactions or the Warrants, including, without
limitation, with respect to any cash amounts or shares of Company Common Stock
that may be receivable, issuable, deliverable or payable by the Company
pursuant to the Company Hedging Transactions or the Warrants (including upon
termination thereof). The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company
Representatives not to, enter into any discussions, negotiations or agreements
with respect to the foregoing without Parents prior written consent, and
shall keep Parent fully informed of all such discussions and negotiations and
give Parent the option to participate in any such discussions and
negotiations. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such
actions as may be required in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of
the applicable letter agreements governing the Company Hedging Transactions
and the Warrants, including the giving of any notices that may be required in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and any conversions of the applicable
Convertible Senior Notes or any adjustment to the respective Conversion Rate
(as such term is defined in the applicable Indentures) occurring as a result

of this Agreement.

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision (or part thereof) of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions (or parts thereof)
of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision (or part thereof) is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall modify this
Agreement, including restructuring the transactions contemplated hereby, so as
to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible (but in no
event limiting the consideration to the Companys stockholders) in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Company Disclosure
Schedule (which is an integral part of this Agreement and is incorporated
herein by reference) and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the Parties
and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,
among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended
to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 



80 8.9 _Assignment_. The Agreement shall not be assigned by any Party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, _provided_ that Merger Sub may assign any of its rights and
obligations to Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, but no
such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder.

8.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) Subject to the following sentences in this _Section 8.10_, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party and their
respective successors and assigns. Except (i) pursuant to _Section 5.9_, (ii)
for the right of the Company on behalf of its stockholders to pursue damages
(including, to the extent proven, damages based on loss of the economic
benefit of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the Companys
stockholders) and other relief (including equitable relief) in the event of
Parents or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement (whether or not this
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ ), which right is
hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub, and (iii)
with respect to the Financing Sources and their respective current, former
or future directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
members, managers, controlling persons, affiliates, employees or
representatives who shall be third party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to rely on,  _Section 7.3_, _Section 8.12_ and this _Section
8.10_ and shall have the right to consent to any modification of _Section
7.3_, _Section 8.12_ and this _Section 8.10_ to the extent
such modification adversely affects their interests, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement. The third party beneficiary rights referenced in
clause (ii) of the preceding sentence may be exercised only by the Company (on
behalf of its stockholders as their agent) through actions expressly approved
by the Company Board, and no stockholder of the Company whether purporting to
act in its capacity as a stockholder or purporting to assert any right
(derivative or otherwise) on behalf of the Company, shall have any right or
ability to exercise or cause the exercise of such right. The representations
and warranties set forth in _Articles III_ and _IV_ and, except for _Section
5.9_, the covenants set forth in _Article V_ have been made solely for the
benefit of the Parties and (i) are intended not as statements of fact, but
rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the Parties if those
statements prove to be inaccurate, (ii) have been qualified by reference to
the Company Disclosure Schedule, which contains certain disclosures that are
not reflected in the text of this Agreement and (iii) may apply standards of
materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by
stockholders of, or other investors in, the Company or Parent.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Financing
Source shall have any liability for any claims or damages to the Company or
any of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives in connection with this Agreement, the Financing, the
Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The
provisions of this  _Section 8.10(b)_ shall inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, each Financing Source and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, each of which is hereby intended to be an express third
party beneficiary of this  _Section 8.10(b)_.

intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and
Schedules to this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to "$" are

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be applicable

jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law, exclusive
jurisdiction over such matters is vested in the Federal courts, any Federal
court located in the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any

of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Court of Chancery

or proceeding in any such court and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, (x) any claim that such Party is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of any such court, (y) any claim that such Party and such
Partys property is immune from any legal process issued by any such court
and (z) the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action
or proceeding in any such court. Each of the Parties agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 8.3_. Nothing in
this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each of the Parties agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources and their respective current, former
or future directors, officers, general or

 



82  limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, controlling persons,
affiliates, employees or representatives in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
Bond Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than any federal
or state court located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION INVOLVING THE FINANCING
SOURCES) IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission or
by e-mail of a .pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
or threatened to be breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall
be entitled (without proof of actual damages or otherwise or posting or
securing any bond) to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, these being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. The right to specific performance shall include
the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated
on the terms and subject to the conditions and obligations (including those in
_Section 5.5_) set forth in this Agreement. The Parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide adequate remedy. Each of the Parties
acknowledges and agrees that the right to specific performance and the other
relief contemplated herein is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without such right, none of the Parties
would have entered into this Agreement.

 



83 8.15 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

hereby. Except in the case of fraud, neither the Company nor any other Person
will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the distribution to
Parent or Merger Sub, or Parents or Merger Subs use of, any such
information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or
other material made available to Parent or Merger Sub in certain "data rooms"
or management presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, unless and then only to the extent that any such information is
expressly included in a representation or warranty contained in _Article
III_.

(b) The Company acknowledges that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in  _Article IV_, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

due and punctual performance of the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
hereunder (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ ") subject to the conditions
hereunder. If, for any reason whatsoever, Parent or Merger Sub shall fail to

Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantor will forthwith pay and cause to be paid in
lawful currency of the United States, with respect to payment obligations, or
perform or cause to be performed, with respect to performance obligations, the
Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment,
demand of payment, filing objections with a court, any right to require
proceeding first against Parent or Merger Sub, any right to require the prior
disposition of the assets of Parent or Merger Sub to meet their respective
obligations, notice, protest and all demands whatsoever. The guarantee
contained in this _Section 8.16_ shall apply regardless of any waivers or
extensions to this Agreement whether or not Guarantor receives notice of the
same and Guarantor waives all need for notice of the same. This is a guarantee
of payment and performance and not of collectibility.

standing under the Laws of the Province of British Columbia. Guarantor has

remedies, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar
Laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to the
effect of general principles of equity.

 



84  Guarantor hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.3_ and _Section 4.4_ with respect to itself. Guarantor owns 100%
of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Parent. Guarantor shall not
transfer or assign, in whole or in part, any of its obligations under this

foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate, amend and/or modify the
Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The
failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.
