(collectively, the "Merger Consideration"); provided, however, that all shares
of Company Common Stock held by Company as treasury stock shall not be
converted into a right to receive a pro rata portion of the Merger
Consideration, but instead shall be canceled as a result of the Merger;
provided further that such Merger Consideration is subject to adjustment
pursuant to Section 3.1(d) and Section 11.1(f).

(c) After the Effective Time, no holder of Company Common Stock that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will have any rights
in respect of such Company Common Stock except to receive a pro rata portion

or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,

and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration to

surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock; no dividend or
distribution of Acquiror shall relate to any fractional share interest; and

to any rights of a shareholder of Acquiror. Instead, each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock having a fractional interest in shares of Acquiror Common
Stock arising upon the conversion of such shares of Company Common Stock shall
be paid by the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without interest
thereon, determined by multiplying such fractional share of Acquiror Common
Stock by $23.87.

issued in a name other than that in which the certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall
pay to the Surviving Corporation any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Acquiror Common
Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or otherwise required, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

Section 3.3 Tax Free Reorganization.

(a) The parties to this Agreement intend for the Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related sections of
the Code. None of Company, any Company Subsidiary, Acquiror or any Acquiror
Subsidiary shall take (or omit to take) any action, whether before or after
the Effective Time, which action (or omission) would disqualify the Merger as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and none
of the parties shall file any Tax Return or take any position inconsistent
therewith, except may be as required pursuant to any Legal Requirement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to preserve
the status of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) and related sections of the Code, if the aggregate value of the shares
of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger (excluding
the value of fractional shares for which cash is to be paid pursuant to
Section 3.2(a)) based upon the closing price of the Acquiror Common Stock as
reported on the NASDAQ on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the "Total Stock Consideration") would be less than forty percent (40%)
of the sum of the Total Cash Consideration and the Total Stock Consideration,
then the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be included in the
Merger Consideration will be increased by such amount, with a corresponding
decrease to the value of the Total Cash Consideration, so that the Total Stock
Consideration is equal to 40% of the sum of the Total Cash Consideration and
the Total Stock Consideration without changing the value of the aggregate
Merger Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Total Cash
Consideration" shall mean the sum of: (i) the aggregate cash consideration to
be paid in exchange for all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock; (ii)
the aggregate cash consideration to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of
Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.2(a); and (iii) the aggregate
amount of any other cash payments to Company or its shareholders that
McGladrey LLP may reasonably require to be included in Total Cash
Consideration in conjunction with the issuance of its opinions contemplated by
Sections 9.11 and 10.9 of this Agreement.

Person. The provisions of this Section 4.9 are not applicable to the "other

Section 4.11 Loans; Loan Loss Reserve.

(a) Each Company Loan reflected as an asset on any of the Company Financial

documentation that is customary and legally sufficient in all material
respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of Company, the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance
with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or
equitable principles or doctrines.

(b) All Company Loans originated or purchased by Company Bank were made or
purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of directors of Company
Bank and in the ordinary course of business of Company Bank. Company Bank's

occurred on the property serving as collateral for such Company Loan or by any
obligor of such Company Loan. (d) Company Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the
Company Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on
the basis of Company Bank's continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio
of Company Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was
established in a manner consistent with Company Bank's internal policies, and,
in the reasonable judgment of Company Bank, was adequate in all material
respects under the requirements of GAAP and all Legal Requirements to provide
for possible or specific losses, net of recoveries relating to Company Loans
previously charged-off, on outstanding Company Loans.

(e) To the Knowledge of Company: (i) none of the Company Loans is subject to

respect to any such fiduciary account, and the accountings for each such
fiduciary account are true and correct in all respects and accurately reflect
the assets of such fiduciary account.

Section 4.23 Indemnification Claims. To the Knowledge of Company, no action or
failure to take action by any director, officer, employee or agent of Company

Company Subsidiary under any agreement with, or the corporate indemnification
provisions of, Company or any Company Subsidiary, or under any Legal
Requirements.

of their respective filing dates and effective dates, as the case may be, with
all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The Acquiror SEC Reports were
prepared in accordance with the requirements of applicable Legal Requirements.
As of their respective filing dates, none of the Acquiror SEC Reports
contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the
date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

(b) Acquiror has previously made available to Company true, correct and
complete copies of all (i) Acquiror SEC Reports filed on or after January 1,
2011; and (ii) Call Reports for Acquiror Bank as of the close of business on
December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and June 30, 2014:

(c) The financial statements presented in the Acquiror SEC Reports referred to

in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. The reports
described in clause (b)(ii) above have been prepared on a basis consistent
with past accounting practices and as required by applicable Legal
Requirements and fairly present the consolidated financial condition and
results of operations at the dates and for the periods presented. Taken
together, the financial statements presented in the Acquiror SEC Reports
referred to in clause (b)(i) above and described in clause (b)(ii) above
(collectively, the "Acquiror Financial Statements") are complete and correct
in all respects and fairly and accurately present the respective financial
position, assets, liabilities and results of operations of Acquiror and the
Acquiror Subsidiaries at the respective dates of and for the periods referred
to in the Acquiror Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments in the case of unaudited Acquiror Financial Statements.

(d) Acquiror has complied in all material respects with: (i) the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended; and (ii) the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

(e) Acquiror and each Acquiror Subsidiary have filed all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed with the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the Iowa
Division and any other applicable federal or state securities or banking
authorities. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form with
the requirements of applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at the
time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed prior
to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but
before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an
earlier date. Section 5.8 Loans; Loan Loss Reserve.

(a) Each Acquiror Loan reflected as an asset on any of the Acquiror Financial
Statements or reports filed with the Regulatory Authorities is evidenced by
documentation that is customary and legally sufficient in all material
respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance
with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or
equitable principles or doctrines.

(b) All Acquiror Loans originated or purchased by Acquiror Bank were made or
purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of directors of
Acquiror Bank and in the ordinary course of business of Acquiror Bank.
Acquiror Bank's interest in all Acquiror Loans is free and clear of any
security interest, lien, encumbrance or other charge, and Acquiror Bank has
complied in all material respects with all Legal Requirements relating to such
Acquiror Loans.

(c) Except as set forth on Acquiror Schedule 5.8(c), Acquiror Bank is not a
party to any Acquiror Loan: (i) under the terms of which the obligor is more
than ninety (90) days delinquent in payment of principal or interest or in
default of any other material provision as of the dates shown thereon or for
which Acquiror Bank has discontinued the accrual of interest; (ii) that has
been classified as "substandard," "doubtful," "loss," "other loans especially
mentioned" or any comparable classifications by Acquiror Bank; (iii) that has
been listed on any "watch list" or similar internal report of Acquiror Bank;
(iv) that has been the subject of any notice from any obligor of adverse
environmental conditions potentially affecting the value of any collateral for
such Acquiror Loan; or (v) with respect to which Acquiror Bank is aware of
potential violations of any Environmental Laws that may have occurred on the
property serving as collateral for such Acquiror Loan or by any obligor of
such Acquiror Loan.

(d) Acquiror Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the
Acquiror Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on
the basis of Acquiror Bank's continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio
of Acquiror Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was
established in a manner consistent with Acquiror Bank's internal policies,
and, in the reasonable judgment of Acquiror Bank, was adequate in all material
respects under the requirements of GAAP and all Legal Requirements to provide
for possible or specific losses, net of recoveries relating to Acquiror Loans
previously charged-off, on outstanding Acquiror Loans.

(e) To the Knowledge of Acquiror: (i) none of the Acquiror Loans is subject to
any material offset or claim of offset; and (ii) the aggregate loan balances
in excess of Acquiror Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses are, based on
past loan loss experience, collectible in accordance with their terms (except
as limited above) and all uncollectible loans have been charged off.

Section 5.9 Compliance with Legal Requirements. Acquiror and each Acquiror
Subsidiary holds all licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and rights
from all appropriate Regulatory Authorities necessary for the conduct of its
respective business. Except as disclosed in an Acquiror SEC Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as set
forth on Acquiror Schedule 5.9, Acquiror and each Acquiror Subsidiary is, and
at all times since January 1, 2011, has been, in compliance with each Legal
Requirement that is or was applicable to it or to the conduct or operation of
its respective businesses or the ownership or use of any of its respective
assets. Except as disclosed in an Acquiror SEC Report filed prior to the date
of this Agreement or as set forth on Acquiror Schedule 5.9, neither Acquiror
nor any Acquiror Subsidiary has received, at any time since January 1, 2011,
any notice or other communication (whether oral or written) from any
Regulatory Authority or any other Person, nor does Acquiror have any
Knowledge, regarding: (i) any actual, alleged, possible or potential violation
of, or failure to comply with, any Legal Requirement; or (ii) any actual,
alleged, possible, or potential obligation on the part of Acquiror or any
Acquiror Subsidiary to undertake, or to bear all or any portion of the cost
of, any remedial action of any nature in connection with a failure to comply
with any Legal Requirement.

Section 5.10 Legal Proceedings; Orders.

(a) Except as disclosed in an Acquiror SEC Report filed prior to the date of
this Agreement or as set forth on Acquiror Schedule 5.10, since January 1,
2011, there have been, and currently are, no Proceedings or Orders pending,
entered into or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, Threatened against, affecting
or involving Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary or any of their respective
assets or businesses, or the Contemplated Transactions that have not been
fully satisfied or terminated and that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror on a consolidated basis, and there is no
fact to Acquiror's Knowledge that would provide a basis for any such
Proceeding or Order. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, no officer, director, agent
or employee of Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary is subject to any Order
that prohibits such officer, director, agent or employee from engaging in or
continuing any conduct, activity or practice relating to the businesses of
Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary as currently conducted.

(b) Neither Acquiror nor any Acquiror Subsidiary: (i) is subject to any cease
and desist or other Order or enforcement action issued by, or (ii) is a party
to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding
with, or (iii) is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to,
or (iv) is subject to any order or directive by, or (v) is subject to any
supervisory letter from, or (vi) has been ordered to pay any civil money
penalty, which has not been paid, by, or (vii) has adopted any policies,
procedures or board resolutions at the request of any Regulatory Authority
that currently (w) restricts in any respect the conduct of its business, or
(x) that in any manner relates to its capital adequacy, or (y) restricts its
ability to pay dividends, or (z) limits in any manner its credit or risk
management policies, its management or its business; nor has Acquiror or any
Acquiror Subsidiary been advised by any Regulatory Authority that it is
considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any of the foregoing.

Section 5.11 Absence of Certain Changes and Events. Since December 31, 2013,
(a) Acquiror and each Acquiror Subsidiary has conducted its business only in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and (b) no
event or events have occurred that have had or would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquiror. Section 5.12 Brokerage Commissions. Except as set forth on Acquiror Schedule
5.12, none of Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary or any of their respective
Representatives has incurred any obligation or liability, contingent or
otherwise, for brokerage or finders' fees or agents' commissions or other
similar payment in connection with this Agreement.

Section 5.13 Approval Delays. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there is no reason
why the granting of any of the regulatory approvals referred to in Section 8.1
would be denied or unduly delayed. Acquiror Bank's most recent CRA rating is
"satisfactory" or better. Additionally, neither Acquiror nor Acquiror Bank is
aware of, based on internal compliance procedures, nor has been advised of,
and has no reason to believe that, any facts or circumstances exist, which
would cause Acquiror Bank to be deemed to be operating in violation in any
respect of the Financial Recordkeeping and Reporting of Currency and Foreign
Transactions Act of 1970, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001,
any order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department
of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-
money laundering statute, rule or regulation.

Section 5.14 Undisclosed Liabilities; Adverse Changes. Except as set forth on
Acquiror Schedule 5.14, neither Acquiror nor any Acquiror Subsidiary has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations reflected or
reserved against in the Acquiror Financial Statements and current liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since the respective dates thereof. Since the date of the latest Acquiror
Financial Statement, there has not been any change in the business,
operations, properties, prospects, assets or condition of Acquiror or any
Acquiror Subsidiary, and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquiror on a consolidated basis.

Section 5.15 Disclosure. Neither any representation nor warranty of Acquiror
in, nor any Acquiror Schedule to, this Agreement by Acquiror contains any
untrue statement of a material fact, or omits to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No notice given
pursuant to Section 7.4 will contain any untrue statement or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, or in this Agreement,
in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

Section 5.16 Tax Treatment. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of
Acquiror, there is no reason why the Merger will fail to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. ARTICLE 6 
COMPANY'S COVENANTS

Section 6.1 Access and Investigation.

(a) Acquiror and its Representatives shall, at all times during normal
business hours and with reasonable advance notice prior to the Closing Date,
have full and continuing access to the facilities, operations, records and
properties of Company and each Company Subsidiary in accordance with the
provisions of this Section. Acquiror and its Representatives may, prior to the
Closing Date, make or cause to be made such reasonable investigation of the
operations, records and properties of Company and each Company Subsidiary and
of their respective financial and legal conditions as Acquiror shall deem
necessary or advisable to familiarize itself with such records, properties and
other matters; provided, however, that such access or investigation shall not
interfere materially with the normal operations of Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Upon request, Company and each Company Subsidiary will furnish
Acquiror or its Representatives attorneys' responses to auditors' requests for
information regarding Company or such Company Subsidiary, as the case may be,
and such financial and operating data and other information reasonably
requested by Acquiror (provided, with respect to attorneys, such disclosure
would not result in the waiver by Company or any Company Subsidiary of any
claim of attorney-client privilege), and will permit Acquiror and its
Representatives to discuss such information directly with any individual or
firm performing auditing or accounting functions for Company or such Company
Subsidiary, and such auditors and accountants shall be directed to furnish
copies of any reports or financial information as developed to Acquiror or its
Representatives. No investigation by Acquiror or any of its Representatives
shall affect the representations and warranties made by Company. This Section
shall not require the disclosure of any information the disclosure of which to
Acquiror would be prohibited by any Legal Requirement.

(b) Company shall allow a representative of Acquiror reasonably acceptable to
Company to attend as an observer: (i) all meetings of the board of directors
of Company and each Company Subsidiary; and (ii) all meetings of the
committees thereof, except, in each case, if Company is advised by any
applicable Regulatory Authority that the participation of such observer is
impermissiable or if Company is advised by its counsel that the participation
by such observer would result in a waiver of Company's attorney-client
privilege. Company shall give reasonable notice to Acquiror of any such
meeting and, if known, the agenda for or business to be discussed at such
meeting. Company shall provide to Acquiror all information provided to the
directors on all such boards and committees in connection with all such
meetings or otherwise provided to the directors, except to the extent that
such information relates to any amendment to this Agreement, or Company is
advised by its counsel that the receipt of such information by such observer
would result in a waiver of Company's attorney-client privilege. It is
understood by the parties that Acquiror's Representative will not have any
voting rights with respect to matters discussed at these meetings and that
Acquiror is not managing the business or affairs of Company. All information
obtained by Acquiror at these meetings shall be treated in confidence as
provided in the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.2 Operation of Company and Company Subsidiaries. Except with the
prior written consent of Acquiror, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Company will, and will cause
each Company Subsidiary to:

(a) conduct its business only in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice;

(b) use its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its current
business organization, keep available the services of its current officers,
employees and agents, and maintain the relations and goodwill with its
suppliers, customers, landlords, creditors, employees, agents and others
having business relationships with it;

(c) confer with Acquiror concerning material issues affecting Company's
operations;

(d) enter into loan and deposit transactions only in accordance with its
formal loan policy and, in that connection, from the date hereof to the
Closing Date, shall not enter into any new credit or new lending relationship
in excess of $5,000,000 with any Person and any director or officer of, or any
owner of a ten percent (10%) or greater equity interest in, such Person;

(e) consistent with past practice, maintain an allowance for loan and lease
losses which is, in the reasonable judgment of Company Bank, adequate in all
material respects under the requirements of GAAP and all Legal Requirements to
provide for possible losses, net of recoveries relating to loans previously
charged off, on loans outstanding;

(f) maintain all of its assets necessary for the conduct of its business in
the same operating condition and repair as they are now in, reasonable wear
and tear and damage by fire or unavoidable casualty excepted, and maintain
policies of insurance upon its assets and with respect to the conduct of its
business in amounts and kinds comparable to that in effect on the date hereof
and pay all premiums on such policies when due;

(g) not buy or sell any security held, or intended to be held, for investment;
provided, however, that such restriction shall not affect the buying and
selling by Company Bank of Federal Funds or the reinvestment of dividends paid
on any securities owned by Company Bank as of the date of this Agreement;

(h) file in a timely manner all required filings with all Regulatory
Authorities and cause such filings to be true and correct in all material
respects; and

(i) maintain its books, accounts and records in the usual, regular and
ordinary manner, on a basis consistent with prior years, and comply with all
Legal Requirements.

Section 6.3 Negative Covenant. Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this
Agreement, or as contemplated by Company Schedule 4.17, between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date, Company will not, and will cause each
Company Subsidiary not to, without the prior written consent of Acquiror,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, take any
affirmative action, or fail to take any reasonable action within its control,
as a result of which any of the changes or events listed in Section 4.17 is
likely to occur. Section 6.4 Subsequent Company Financial Statements. As soon as available
after the date hereof, Company will furnish Acquiror copies of the quarterly
unaudited consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income,
consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated statements of
shareholders' equity of Company prepared for its internal use, and Company
Bank's Call Reports for each quarterly period completed after June 30, 2014,
and all other financial reports or statements submitted after the date hereof
by Company or Company Bank to Regulatory Authorities, to the extent permitted
by law (collectively, the "Subsequent Company Financial Statements"). Except
as may be required by changes in GAAP effective after the date hereof, the
Subsequent Company Financial Statements shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with past accounting practices and shall fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial condition and results of
operations for the dates and periods presented.

Section 6.5 Advice of Changes. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Company will promptly notify Acquiror in writing if Company or
any Company Subsidiary becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or
constitutes a breach of any of Company's representations and warranties as of
the date of this Agreement, or if Company or any Company Subsidiary becomes
aware of the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact or
condition that would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement)
cause or constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty had such
representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery
of such fact or condition. If any such fact or condition would require any
change in the Company Schedules if such Company Schedules were dated the date
of the occurrence or discovery of any such fact or condition, Company will
promptly deliver to Acquiror a supplement to the Company Schedules specifying
such change. During the same period, Company will promptly notify Acquiror of
the occurrence of any breach of any covenant of Company in this Article or of
the occurrence of any event that might reasonably be expected to make the
satisfaction of the conditions in Article 9 impossible or unlikely.

Section 6.6 Company Shareholder Approval. Subject to its fiduciary duties,
Company and its board of directors shall recommend to Company's shareholders
the approval of this Agreement, and beginning on the date of this Agreement,
shall take all lawful action to obtain the unanimous approval of its
shareholders by written consent (the "Written Consent"). Promptly following
receipt of the Written Consent, Company shall cause its corporate secretary to
deliver a copy of the Written Consent to Acquiror, together with a certificate
executed on behalf of Company by its corporate secretary certifying that such
Written Consent reflects the unanimous approval of this Agreement by the
Company's shareholders. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge
that: (a) the failure of Company to make the recommendations required by or to
withdraw, modify or change such recommendation as provided in the provisions
of this Section 6.6; or (b) the failure of Company's shareholders to provide
the Written Consent; or (c) the withdrawal or modification of the Written
Consent by the Company's shareholders, shall each be deemed to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company on a consolidated basis and on Acquiror's rights
under this Agreement.

Section 6.7 Information Provided to Acquiror. Company agrees that the
information concerning Company or any Company Subsidiary that is provided or
to be provided by Company to Acquiror for inclusion or that is included in the
Acquiror Proxy Statement and any documents to be filed with any Regulatory
Authority in connection with the Contemplated Transactions will, at the
respective times such documents are filed and, with respect to the Acquiror
Proxy Statement, when mailed, will not be false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading or, in the case of the Acquiror Proxy
Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, at the time of the
meeting of Acquiror's shareholders referred to above, be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect
to the solicitation of any proxy for the meeting in connection with which the
Proxy Statement shall be mailed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company shall
have no responsibility for the truth or accuracy of any information with
respect to Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates
contained in the Acquiror Proxy Statement or in any document submitted to, or
other communication with, any Regulatory Authority.

Section 6.8 Accounting and Other Adjustments. Company agrees that it shall,
and shall cause each Company Subsidiary, to: (a) make any accounting
adjustments or entries to its books of account and other financial records;

sell or transfer any investment securities held by it; (d) charge-off any loan
or lease; (e) create any new reserve account or make additional provisions to
any other existing reserve account; (f) make changes in any accounting method;
(g) accelerate, defer or accrue any anticipated obligation, expense or income
item; and (h) make any other adjustments that would affect the financial
reporting of Acquiror, on a consolidated basis after the Effective Time, in
any case as Acquiror shall reasonably request; provided, however, that neither
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be obligated to take any such
requested action (i) if such requested action is inconsistent with GAAP, as
modified by applicable regulatory accounting principles, or (ii) until
immediately prior to the Closing and at such time as Acquiror shall confirm in
writing that it has satisfied all of the conditions listed in Article 10
(except for the completion of actions to be taken at the Closing), unless the
satisfaction of any such conditions shall have been waived by Company, and
that, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, there are no facts or circumstances which
would prevent Acquiror from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.9 Capital Stock. Except as otherwise permitted in or contemplated by
this Agreement and without the prior written consent of Acquiror, from the
date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement, Company shall not, and shall not enter into any agreement
to, issue, sell or otherwise permit to become outstanding any additional
shares of Company Common Stock or any other capital stock of Company, or any
stock appreciation rights, or any option, warrant, conversion or other right
to acquire any such stock, or any security convertible into any such stock.

Section 6.10 Employee Agreements. Within fifteen (15) Business Days of the
date hereof, Company shall cause to be delivered to Acquiror: (a) an
employment agreement; (b) a change in control agreement; (c) a restrictive
covenant agreement to be effective upon the Effective Time; and (d) a
restrictive covenant agreement to be effective immediately upon execution;
each in the form reasonably acceptable to the parties thereto, which such
parties are indicated on Acquiror Schedule 6.10.

Section 6.11 Shareholder Agreement. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Company shall cause to be delivered to Acquiror an
executed shareholder agreement in the form of Exhibit G from the John M. Morrison Revocable Trust #4 (the
"Shareholder Agreement").

Section 6.12 Dividends. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Company
may declare and pay to its shareholders, aggregate cash dividends and tax
distributions in an amount set forth in Company Schedule 6.12; provided,
however, if Company's full-year 2014 net income is less than $12,000,000,
Company and Acquiror shall adjust in good faith the permitted dividends and
tax distribution amounts in Company Schedule 6.12; and (ii) if the Effective
Time occurs after January 31, 2015, Company may declare and pay tax
distributions equal to forty percent (40%) of Company's net income earned
between January 31, 2015 and the Effective Time. Company shall not declare,
pay or make any other dividend or other distribution or payment in respect of,
or redemption of, shares of Company Common Stock.

Section 6.13 Title to Real Estate. As soon as practical after the date hereof,
but in any event no later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof, Company
shall obtain and deliver to Acquiror, with respect to all interests in real
property owned by Company and its Subsidiaries, an owner's preliminary report
of title covering a date subsequent to the date hereof, issued by a title
insurance company that is reasonably acceptable to Acquiror, showing fee
simple title to such real property in Company or its Subsidiary and setting
forth all requirements for coverage over all standard exceptions. If the
preliminary reports show any exceptions to title other than Permitted
Exceptions, and Company does not cause such exception to be removed within
forty-five (45) days after written notice thereof is given to Company by
Acquiror, Acquiror may, at its sole option, terminate this Agreement. The cost
of obtaining any preliminary report of title discussed in this Section 6.13
shall be borne by Company. The provisions of this Section 6.13 are not
applicable to the OREO of Company or any Company Subsidiary, and are
applicable only to properties used in the business operations of Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

Section 6.14 Surveys. Acquiror may, in its discretion, within forty-five (45)
days after the date hereof, require Company to provide, at Acquiror's expense
and as soon as practicable prior to the Closing, a current American Land Title
Association survey of any or all parcels of real property owned by Company and
its Subsidiaries, other than property carried as OREO. If the surveys show any
matters affecting the use or value of the properties other than Permitted
Exceptions, and Company does not cause such matter to be corrected within
forty-five (45) days after written notice thereof is given to Company by
Acquiror, Acquiror may, at its sole option, terminate this Agreement. The
provisions of this Section 6.14 are not applicable to the OREO of Company or
any Company Subsidiary, and are applicable only to properties used in the
business operations of Company or any Company Subsidiary.

Section 6.15 Environmental Investigation.

(a) Acquiror may, in its discretion, require Company to order, at Acquiror's
expense, a Phase I environmental site assessment complying with the ASTM
E1527-13 standard to be delivered only to Acquiror within forty-five (45) days
after the date of this Agreement for each parcel of real property in which
Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds an interest (each a "Phase I
Report"), conducted by an independent professional consultant reasonably
acceptable to Acquiror to determine if any real property in which Company or any of its Subsidiaries
holds any interest contains or gives evidence of any adverse environmental
condition or any violations of Environmental Laws on any such property. If a
Phase I Report discloses any violations, adverse environmental conditions, or
recognized environmental conditions as defined by the applicable ASTM E1527-13
standard or reports a reasonable suspicion thereof, or associated "business
environmental risk" under the applicable ASTM E1527-13 standard, then Acquiror
may promptly obtain, at Company's expense, a Phase II environmental report
with respect to any affected property which report shall contain an estimate
of the cost of any remediation or other follow-up work that may be necessary
to address those violations or conditions in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements (each a "Phase II Report," and collectively referred to with the
associated Phase I Report, an "Environmental Report"). Acquiror shall have no
duty to act upon any information produced by an Environmental Report for the
benefit of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person, but shall
provide such information to Company upon Company's request.

(b) Upon receipt of the estimate of the costs of all follow-up work to an
Environmental Report, Acquiror and Company shall attempt to agree upon a
course of action for remediation of any adverse environmental condition or
violation suspected, found to exist, or that would tend to be indicated by an
Environmental Report. The estimated total cost for completing all necessary
work plans or removal or remediation actions is referred to collectively as
the "Remediation Cost." If the aggregate Remediation Cost for the total
parcels of property in which Company or its Subsidiaries holds an interest
exceeds $1,000,000, either Acquiror or Company may, at its sole option,
terminate this Agreement.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.15 are not applicable to the OREO of
Company or any Company Subsidiary, and are applicable only to properties used
in the business operations of Company and each Company Subsidiary.

Section 6.16 Necessary Consents. As soon as practical after the date hereof,
Company shall use its best efforts to give any notice and obtain any consent
or approval set forth on Company Schedule 4.4.

ARTICLE 7 
ACQUIROR'S COVENANTS

Section 7.1 Access and Investigation. Company and its Representatives shall,
at all times during normal business hours and with reasonable advance notice
prior to the Closing Date, have full and continuing access to the facilities,
operations, records and properties of Acquiror and each Acquiror Subsidiary in
accordance with the provisions of this Section. Company and its
Representatives may, prior to the Closing Date, make or cause to be made such
reasonable investigation of the operations, records and properties of Acquiror
and each Acquiror Subsidiary and of their respective financial and legal
conditions as Company shall deem necessary or advisable to familiarize itself
with such records, properties and other matters; provided, however, that such
access or investigation shall not interfere materially with the normal
operations of Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary. Upon request, Acquiror and
each Acquiror Subsidiary will furnish Company or its Representatives
attorneys' responses to auditors' requests for information regarding Acquiror
or such Acquiror Subsidiary, as the case may be, and such financial and
operating data and other information reasonably requested by Company (provided, with respect to
attorneys, such disclosure would not result in the waiver by Acquiror or
Acquiror Bank of any claim of attorney-client privilege), and will permit
Company and its Representatives to discuss such information directly with any
individual or firm performing auditing or accounting functions for Acquiror or
such Acquiror Subsidiary, and such auditors and accountants shall be directed
to furnish copies of any reports or financial information as developed to

earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
its terms, Acquiror shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to: (i)
conduct its business in the ordinary course of business in all material
respects; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve
intact its business organization and advantageous business relationships; and

its covenants and agreements under this Agreement or to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions.

(b) Except as expressly contemplated by or permitted by this Agreement, as
required by any applicable Legal Requirement, or with the prior written
consent of Company, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
its terms, Acquiror will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries not to:

(i) (A) except as permitted pursuant to Section 7.10, make, declare, pay or
set aside for payment any dividend on or in respect of, or declare or make any
distribution on any shares of Acquiror Common Stock (other than dividends from

Subsidiaries); or (B) directly or indirectly adjust, split, combine, redeem,
reclassify, purchase or otherwise acquire, any shares of Acquiror Common
Stock;

(ii) amend Acquiror's articles of incorporation or bylaws, or similar

methods, other than as may be required by GAAP or applicable regulatory
accounting requirements;

(iv) agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any resolutions of
Acquiror's board of directors in support of, any of the actions prohibited by
this Section 7.2. Section 7.3 Subsequent Acquiror Financial Statements; Subsequent Acquiror SEC
Reports. As soon as available after the date hereof, Acquiror will deliver to
Company complete copies of any reports filed with the SEC after June 30, 2014
(the "Subsequent Acquiror SEC Reports") and Acquiror Bank's Call Reports for
each quarterly period completed after June 30, 2014, and all other financial
reports or statements submitted after the date hereof by Acquiror or Acquiror
Bank to Regulatory Authorities, to the extent permitted by law (collectively,
the "Subsequent Acquiror Financial Statements"), with the filing or submitting
of such Subsequent Acquiror Financial Statements with the SEC or applicable
Regulatory Authorities being deemed, for the purposes of this Section 7.3, to
constitute such delivery required to Company. Except as may be required by
changes in GAAP effective after the date hereof, the Subsequent Acquiror
Financial Statements shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past
accounting practices and shall fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the dates and
periods presented. The Subsequent Acquiror SEC Reports will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein not misleading.

Section 7.4 Advice of Changes. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Acquiror will promptly notify Company in writing if Acquiror or
any Acquiror Subsidiary becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or
constitutes a breach of any of Acquiror's representations and warranties as of
the date of this Agreement, or if Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary becomes
aware of the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact or
condition that would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement)
cause or constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty had such
representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery
of such fact or condition. If any such fact or condition would require any
change in the Acquiror Schedules if such Acquiror Schedules were dated the
date of the occurrence or discovery of any such fact or condition, Acquiror
will promptly deliver to Company a supplement to the Acquiror Schedules
specifying such change. During the same period, Acquiror will promptly notify
Company of the occurrence of any breach of any covenant of Acquiror in this
Article or of the occurrence of any event that might reasonably be expected to
make the satisfaction of the conditions in Article 10 impossible or unlikely.

Section 7.5 Shareholders' Meeting. Acquiror shall cause a meeting of its
shareholders for the purpose of acting upon this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the issuance of shares of Acquiror
Common Stock in satisfaction of a portion of the Merger Consideration, and any
and all other matters that Acquiror determines in good faith to be necessary
or desirable in conjunction therewith, to be held as soon as practicable.
Acquiror shall mail to its shareholders, at least twenty (20) Business Days
prior to such meeting, notice of such meeting together with the Acquiror Proxy
Statement, which shall include a copy of this Agreement. Subject to its
fiduciary duties, Acquiror and its board of directors shall recommend to
shareholders the approval of this Agreement and shall solicit proxies voting
only in favor thereof from the shareholders of Acquiror. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties acknowledge that the failure of Acquiror to cause a meeting
of its shareholders to be held for the purposes set forth in the Agreement or
otherwise to make the recommendations required by or to withdraw, modify or
change such recommendation as provided in the provisions of this Section 7.5
shall be deemed to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror on a consolidated basis and on Company's and its
shareholders' rights under this Agreement.

Section 7.6 Information Provided to Company. Acquiror agrees that none of the
information concerning Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary that is provided or
to be provided by Acquiror to Company for inclusion or that is included in any
documents to be filed with any Regulatory Authority in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions will, at the respective times such documents are
filed be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror shall have no
responsibility for the truth or accuracy of any information with respect to
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates contained in the
Acquiror Proxy Statement or in any document submitted to, or other
communication with, any Regulatory Authority.

Section 7.7 Indemnification. Except as may be limited by applicable Legal
Requirements, Acquiror shall honor any of Company's obligations in respect of
indemnification and advancement of expenses currently provided by Company in
its articles of incorporation or bylaws in favor of the current and former
directors and officers of Company and Company Bank for not less than three (3)
years from the Effective Time with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 7.2, Acquiror shall
acquire and maintain for a period of three (3) years extended insurance
coverage of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to those persons who are currently covered by Company's director and
officer liability policies of insurance on terms with respect to such coverage
and amount substantially similar to the terms and conditions of Company's
director and officer liability policies of insurance in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that Acquiror shall not be
obligated to make annual premium payments (or the annualized equivalent in
premium payments for whatever period may be covered) pursuant to this Section
7.7 for such insurance coverage to the extent such premiums exceed 150% of the
annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by Company for its current premiums
for such insurance (the "Insurance Expense Cap"). If Acquiror is unable to
obtain an insurance policy with the coverage required hereby within the
Insurance Expense Cap, then Acquiror shall use the full amount of the
Insurance Expense Cap to obtain one or more alternate insurance policies,
which, in its good faith determination, provide as much coverage as is
commercially obtainable.

Section 7.8 Nasdaq Listing. Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to
list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to official notice of
issuance, all shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued in connection with
the Merger.

that the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation will consist of the
Acquiror Directors and the Company Directors.

contrary, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Acquiror
may declare and pay to its shareholders, a quarterly cash dividend not to
exceed $0.16 per share of Acquiror Common Stock. Section 7.11 Shareholder Agreement. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Acquiror shall cause the executed Shareholder
Agreement to be delivered to each shareholder of Company party to such
agreement.

Section 7.12 Necessary Consents. As soon as practical after the date hereof,
Acquiror shall use its best efforts to give any notice and obtain any consent
or approval set forth on Acquiror Schedule 5.4.

provided, however, that Acquiror may, without the prior consent of Company,

announcement to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements or by the
listing rules of NASDAQ.

Section 8.5 Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation. Each of Acquiror and Company
agrees to exercise good faith and use its reasonable best efforts to satisfy
the various covenants and conditions to Closing in this Agreement, and to

Acquiror, as the surviving entity, will make severance payments to certain
current or former employees of either Acquiror or Company, pursuant to the
general severance plan to be established as provided in Acquiror Schedule 8.6.

Section 8.7 Employee Benefits.

(a) All individuals employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Closing ("Covered Employees") shall automatically become
employees of Acquiror as of the Closing for the purposes of the Acquiror
Benefit Plans. Following the Closing, Acquiror shall, or shall cause an
Acquiror Subsidiary to, maintain employee benefit plans and compensation
opportunities for the benefit of Covered Employees that provide employee
benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the aggregate, are
substantially similar to the employee benefits and compensation opportunities
that are made available to similarly-situated employees of Acquiror under the
Acquiror Benefit Plans; provided, however, that: (i) in no event shall any
Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen Acquiror
Benefit Plan; and (ii) until such time as Acquiror shall cause Covered
Employees to participate in the Acquiror Benefit Plans, a Covered Employee's
continued participation in the Company Benefit Plans shall be deemed to
satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that
participation in the Acquiror Benefit Plans may commence at different times
with respect to each Acquiror Benefit Plan). For purposes of this Agreement,
"Acquiror Benefit Plan" means each "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA), employment, compensation, pension, retirement,
supplemental retirement, profit sharing, deferred compensation, savings, stock
option, stock purchase, stock ownership, stock appreciation right, phantom
stock, equity compensation, consulting, bonus, incentive, medical, dental,
vision, disability, flexible spending, workers' compensation, vacation, paid time off, group insurance, severance and other
similar plan, program, policy, agreement and arrangement, and each trust
agreement related thereto, for which Acquiror or an Acquiror Subsidiary has or
may have any liabilities, including by reason of Acquiror and any Person being
treated as a single employer within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or
(o) of the Code.

(b) For all purposes (other than purposes of benefit accruals) under the
Acquiror Benefit Plans providing benefits to the Covered Employees (the "New
Plans"), each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors to
the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled to credit for such
service under any applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Closing Date; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service.

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of
the Closing Date, Acquiror shall, or shall cause an Acquiror Subsidiary to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that: (i) each Covered Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is similar in
type to an applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was
participating immediately prior to the Closing Date (such Company Benefit
Plans prior to the Closing Date collectively, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or
similar benefits to any Covered Employee, all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan shall be waived
for such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan in which such Covered
Employee, as applicable, participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (iii) any eligible expenses
incurred by such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the Closing Date shall be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this Section 8.7 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 8.7 is intended to, or shall,
constitute the establishing or adoption of or an amendment to any employee
benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current or former
employee of Company or any Company Subsidiary or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement or shall have the right to enforce any of the provisions hereof,
including in respect of continued employment.

Section 8.8 Trust Preferred Securities. Upon the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants
to be performed by Company pursuant to the junior subordinated debentures (the
"Trust Debentures") issued by Company to each of Barron Investment Capital
Trust I, Central Bancshares Capital Trust II, Central Bancshares Capital Trust
II, and CBI Capital Trust III, each a Delaware statutory trust, relating to
the trust preferred securities issued by each such trust, and the due and punctual
payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on such trust
preferred securities. In connection therewith, Acquiror and Company shall
execute and deliver any supplemental indentures or other documents, and the
parties hereto shall provide any opinion of counsel to the trustee thereof,
required to make such assumption effective.

Section 8.9 Foundation Donation. Company agrees to make a donation of
$950,000.00 to the MidWestOne Foundation, which will be payable at or prior to
the Closing. Acquiror shall, at or after the Effective Time, cause: (a) the
number of directors of the MidWestOne Foundation to be set at six (6),
consisting of three (3) Company Directors and three (3) Acquiror Directors;
and (b) the articles of incorporation of the MidWestOne Foundation to be
amended such that the purpose of the MidWestOne Foundation is to provide a
pool of funds to be used to enhance community and cultural well-being within
the trade areas in which the Surviving Corporation operates.

Section 8.10 Company Benefit Plans.

(a) Subject to Section 8.7(a), the parties acknowledge that they will use
reasonable best efforts to determine, in collaboration with one another, prior
to Closing those Company Benefit Plans, if any, that will continue in effect
following the Closing. To the extent the parties determine that any Company
Benefit Plan should be terminated prior to Closing, Company shall take, or
shall cause a Company Subsidiary to take, all action necessary and appropriate
(including the adoption of written board resolutions in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror) to: (i) terminate each such Company
Benefit Plan and (ii) timely provide any required notice to participants,
beneficiaries, third party service providers or governmental authorities in
connection with such Company Benefit Plan.

(b) Following the review under Section 8.10(a), if the parties do not come to
agreement with respect to any particular Company Benefit Plan, to the extent
requested by Acquiror, effective no later than immediately prior to the
Closing, Company shall take, or shall cause a Company Subsidiary to take, all
action necessary and appropriate (including the adoption of written board
resolutions in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror) to: (i)
terminate such Company Benefit Plan and (ii) timely provide any required
notice to participants, beneficiaries, third party service providers or
governmental authorities in connection with such Company Benefit Plan.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 8.10(a), Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that (i)
all Company and Company Bank supplemental retirement plans set forth in
Company Schedule 8.10 will be assumed by Acquiror as of the Closing Date and
(ii) Acquiror will not terminate or amend such supplemental retirement plans
prior to January 1, 2016.

Section 8.11 Tax Returns.

(a) Company's shareholders shall prepare (or cause to be prepared for Company
and Company Bank) all Tax Returns due for Company and Company Bank for the
period up to and including the day prior to the Closing Date (which may be a
short period return) and for all periods ending at and including, or before,
the day prior to the Closing Date (collectively, "Effective Time Tax Returns"). Company's shareholders shall timely pay (or cause to be paid)
all taxes relating to Effective Time Tax Returns.

(b) Acquiror shall timely prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed)
all Tax Returns required by law for all taxes arising in the operation of the
business of Company and Company Bank for periods beginning on or after the
Closing Date ("Post Effective Time Tax Returns"). Buyer shall timely pay (or
cause to be paid) all taxes relating to Post Effective Time Tax Returns.

(c) After the Closing Date, Acquiror and Company's shareholders shall
cooperate in the preparation of all Tax Returns and shall provide, or cause to
be provided, to the requesting party any records or other information
requested by such party in connection therewith as well as access to, and the
cooperation of, the auditors of Acquiror. Company's shareholders, on the one
hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand, shall give prompt notice to each other
as provided in this Agreement of any proposed adjustment to taxes for periods
ending at and including, or before, the day prior to the Closing Date (or
beginning at and ending after the Closing Date). Promptly upon receipt by
either party of any notification or indication (whether written or oral) from
the Internal Revenue Service that it intends to investigate or audit any
Effective Time Tax Return, the party receiving such information shall notify
the other party and convey such information to the other party in writing.
Each party shall cooperate with the other in connection with any tax
investigation, audit, or other proceeding. A party shall be reimbursed for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in taking any action requested by

evidenced by appropriate written resolutions;

(b) by Acquiror if: (i) any of the conditions in Article 9 has not been

of the Contemplated Transactions and such denial has become final and
nonappealable; or (ii) any application, filing or notice for a regulatory
approval has been withdrawn at the request or recommendation of the applicable
Regulatory Authority; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 11.1(e) shall not be available to a party whose
failure (or the failure of any of its Affiliates) to fulfill any of its
obligations (excluding warranties and representations) under this Agreement or
the Shareholder Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the occurrence
of any event described in clauses (i) and (ii) above; and

appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 11.1(f).

11:59 p.m. on the Termination Date; provided, however, that: (i) the
Termination Date may be extended one or more times, but not to a date later
than June 30, 2015, by either party on or before the then‑current Termination

10 that has not been satisfied as of the tenth (10th) day prior to the
then‑current Termination Date (other than any condition which by its nature
can only be satisfied at the Closing) is the receipt of any approval or
consent of any of the Federal Reserve, the Iowa Division, the Minnesota
Department or any other Regulatory Authority which is required for
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, or the expiration of the
applicable waiting periods relating thereto, and no such approval or consent
has been denied or, if it has been denied, such denial has not become final
and nonappealable, and none of the Federal Reserve, the Iowa Division, the
Minnesota Department or any other Regulatory Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the Contemplated
Transactions; and (y) the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
11.1(g) shall not be available to a party whose failure (or the failure of any
of its Affiliates) to fulfill any of its obligations (excluding warranties and
representations) under this Agreement or the Shareholder Agreement has been
the cause of or resulted in the failure to obtain any approval or consent of
any Regulatory Authority required for consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, or the expiration of the applicable waiting periods relating
thereto, prior to the then‑current Termination Date.

timely satisfaction of conditions precedent to the obligations of a party to
the extent that such failure of timely satisfaction is attributable to the
actions or inactions of such party. ARTICLE 12

 Exhibit A-1

AMENDMENT TO THE BYLAWS

OF

MIDWESTONE FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

Adopted by the Board of Directors on __________ ___, 2014.

RESOLVED, that the Bylaws of MidWestOne Financial Group, Inc. (the "Company")
be amended as of the effective time of the merger of Central Bancshares, Inc.
with and into the Company pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of
Merger between the Company and Central Bancshares, Inc., dated November 20,
2014 (the "Effective Time"), to delete Section 3.2 in its entirety and replace
it with the following:

"Section 3.2. Number, Tenure, Qualifications. In accordance with Section 2.6
of the Agreement and Plan of Merger between the corporation and Central
Bancshares, Inc. ("Central"), dated November 20, 2014 (the "Agreement"), the
following provisions shall govern directors to the exclusion of any provision
in these bylaws to the contrary. Terms capitalized but not otherwise defined
in these bylaws shall have the meaning given to them in the Agreement. At the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the corporation, as the Surviving
Corporation, shall consist of thirteen directors who shall consist of: (i)
eight persons serving as directors of the corporation (each, a
"Company‑Related Director") and (ii) five persons serving as directors of
Central (each, a "Central‑Related Director"), in each case serving in such
capacity immediately prior to the Effective Time.

The directors shall be divided into three classes. Immediately following the
Effective Time, the Class I directors shall consist of three Company‑Related
Directors and two Central‑Related Directors, one of whom shall be John M.
Morrison. The initial Class I directors shall hold office for an initial term
expiring at the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders and Class I directors
shall thereafter be elected to three-year terms. At the 2017 annual meeting of
shareholders, Mr. Morrison, if then still serving as a director, shall not
stand for reelection, and, provided that Mr. Morrison has served for the
entirety of his initial term, the Board of Directors shall nominate for
election to Mr. Morrison's seat on the Board of Directors an individual
recommended by Mr. Morrison, provided further that such nomination is
reasonably agreeable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in
accordance with the good faith execution of its duties. If, prior to the 2017
annual meeting of shareholders, Mr. Morrison shall have resigned or been
removed in accordance with these bylaws, the Board of Directors may fill the
resultant vacancy in accordance with Section 3.8 hereof or elect to reduce the
total number of Central‑Related Directors entitled to serve on the Board of
Directors by one, with a corresponding reduction in the total number of
directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. If, prior to the 2017
annual meeting of shareholders, Mr. Morrison shall cease to serve as a director for any reason other than those
set forth in the preceding sentence, the Board of Directors shall fill the
resultant vacancy with an individual selected by the Central‑Related Directors
in good faith in a manner intended to preserve the principles of
representation in these bylaws, provided that such individual is reasonably
agreeable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance
with the good faith execution of its duties, and upon the expiration of such
individual's initial term at the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, shall
nominate such individual, provided again that such nomination is reasonably
agreeable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance
with the good faith execution of its duties, for an additional term to expire
at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders. Upon the expiration of his or her
initial term, the Class I Central‑Related Director other than Mr. Morrison
(the "Remaining Class I Central‑Related Director") shall be nominated by the
Board of Directors, provided that such nomination is reasonably agreeable to
the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the good
faith execution of its duties, for an additional term to expire at the 2020
annual meeting of shareholders. If, prior to the 2020 annual meeting of
shareholders, the Remaining Class I Central‑Related Director shall for any
reason cease to serve as a director or shall not stand for reelection as a
director, the resultant vacancy shall be filled by the Board of Directors with
an individual selected by the Central‑Related Directors in good faith in a
manner intended to preserve the principles of representation in these bylaws,
provided that such individual is reasonably agreeable to the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the good faith execution of
its duties, which such individual, if appointed to the Board of Directors
prior to the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, will be nominated by the
Board of Directors for reelection at such annual meeting, provided again that
such nomination is reasonably agreeable to the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee in accordance with the good faith execution of its
duties, for an additional term to expire at the 2020 annual meeting of
shareholders.

Immediately following the Effective Time, the Class II directors shall consist
of two Company‑Related Directors and two Central‑Related Directors. The
initial Class II directors shall hold office for an initial term expiring at
the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders and Class II directors shall
thereafter be elected to three‑year terms. Upon the expiration of their
initial terms, the initial Class II Central-Related Directors shall be
nominated by the Board of Directors, provided that such nominations are
reasonably agreeable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in
accordance with the good faith execution of its duties, for an additional term
to expire at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, and, upon the expiration
of such subsequent term, to an additional term to expire at the 2021 annual
meeting of shareholders. If, prior to the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders,
either Class II Central‑Related Director shall for any reason cease to serve
as a director or shall not stand for reelection as a director, the resultant
vacancy shall be filled by the Board of Directors with an individual selected
by the Central‑Related Directors in good faith in a manner intended to
preserve the principles of representation in these bylaws, provided that such individual is reasonably agreeable to the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the good faith execution of
its duties, which such individual, if appointed to the Board of Directors
prior to the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, will be nominated for
reelection by the Board of Directors, provided again that such nomination is
reasonably agreeable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in
accordance with the good faith execution of its duties, for any additional
terms expiring at or before the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders.

Immediately following the Effective Time, the Class III directors shall
consist of three Company‑Related Directors and one Central‑Related Director,
who shall be Larry Albert. The initial Class III directors shall hold office
for an initial term expiring at the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders and
Class III directors shall thereafter be elected to three‑year terms. At the
2016 annual meeting of shareholders, the Class III Central-Related Director
shall not stand for reelection, upon which time the total number of
Central‑Related Directors entitled to serve on the Board of Directors shall be
reduced by one, with a corresponding reduction in the total number of
directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. If, prior to the 2016
annual meeting of shareholders, the Class III Central-Related Director shall
for any reason cease to serve as a director, the reduction in the number of
Central‑Related Directors entitled to serve on the Board of Directors and
corresponding reduction in the total number of directors constituting the
entire Board of Directors shall be accelerated to the date on which such Class
III Central-Related Director ceases to serve.

If, prior to the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, any Company‑Related
Director shall for any reason cease to serve as a director or shall not stand
for reelection as a director, he or she shall be replaced by the Board of
Directors with an individual selected by the Company‑Related Directors in good
faith in a manner intended to preserve the principles of representation in
these bylaws, provided that such individual is reasonably agreeable to the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the good
faith execution of its duties.

Following, the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, the number of directors
constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be not less than eleven nor
more than fifteen, as fixed from time to time by resolution of not less than a
majority of the number of directors that, immediately prior to such proposed
change, had been fixed in the manner prescribed by this Section 3.2; provided,
however, that the number of directors shall not be reduced so as to shorten
the term of any director at the time in office. Directors need not be
shareholders of the corporation.

The Board of Directors may appoint individuals to serve as honorary directors
or as directors emeritus. An individual so appointed shall not vote at any
meeting of the Board of Directors, shall not be counted in determining a
quorum, and shall not be charged with any responsibilities or be subject to
any liabilities imposed upon directors. Provided that Mr. Morrison serves for
the entirety of his initial term on the Board of Directors, he shall serve as
a director emeritus from the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders until the 180th day following the fourth anniversary
of the Effective Time."

RESOLVED, that the Bylaws of the Company be amended as of the Effective Time
to delete Section 3.7 in its entirety and replace it with the following:

"Section 3.7. Manner of Acting; Actions Requiring Supermajority Approval.

(a) Except as provided below or as otherwise provided in these bylaws, the act
of the majority of the Board of Directors present at a meeting at which a
quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.

Time, the following actions may not be taken without the approval of a

of the corporation; or

(v) the issuance of securities requiring the approval of the corporation's
shareholders pursuant to NASDAQ Rule 5635(a) or (b), or similar rules of any
other national securities exchange upon which the corporation's securities are
listed; or

(vi) the amendment of Sections 3.2, 3.7, 3.8, 3.14, 4.2, and 4.3 and Article
XIII of these bylaws.

(c) For purposes of this Section 3.7, a "supermajority" of the full Board of
Directors shall consist of: (i) sixty-seven percent of the full Board of
Directors at any time five Central-Related Directors are entitled to serve;
and (ii) seventy‑five percent of the full Board of Directors at any time there
are fewer than five Central-Related Directors entitled to serve." RESOLVED, that the Bylaws of the Company be amended as of the Effective Time
to delete Section 3.8 in its entirety and replace it with the following:

"Section 3.8. Vacancies. Subject to Section 3.2, in case one or more vacancies
shall occur on the Board of Directors by reason of death, resignation, an
increase in the number of directors or otherwise, the vacancy may be filled by
the Board of Directors, or, if the directors remaining in office constitute
fewer than a quorum of the Board of Directors, by the affirmative vote of a
majority of all such directors remaining in office."

RESOLVED, that the Bylaws of the Company be amended as of the Effective Time
to delete the first paragraph of Section 3.14 in its entirety and replace it

candidates for election as directors at any meeting of shareholders may be
made: (i) by, or at the direction of, a majority of the Board of Directors or
a designated committee thereof; or (ii) by any shareholder of record entitled
to vote at such meeting; provided that only persons nominated in accordance
with procedures set forth in this Section shall be eligible for election as
directors; provided further that no person, other than John M. Morrison (who
shall be eligible to serve through the annual meeting of shareholders held in
2017 regardless of his age) shall be eligible for election to the Board of
Directors if such person has attained the age of seventy-two years prior to
the date of the meeting of shareholders at which such person would be
elected."

RESOLVED, that the Bylaws of the Company be amended as of the Effective Time
to delete Section 4.2 in its entirety and replace it with the following:

"Section 4.2. Election and Term of Office. The officers of the corporation to
be elected by the Board of Directors shall be elected annually by the Board of
Directors at the first meeting of the Board of Directors held after each
annual meeting of the shareholders. If the election of officers shall not be

SHAREHOLDERS

Section 2.1. Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of the shareholders shall be
held in the month of April (or such other month as determined by the Board of
Directors) in each year on such day and at such time as shall be designated by
the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of such meeting for the
purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business
as may properly come before the meeting. If the election of directors shall
not be held on the day designated herein for any annual meeting of the
shareholders, or at any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors shall
cause the election to be held at a special meeting of the shareholders as soon
thereafter as conveniently may be.

Business to be considered by the shareholders shall be brought before an
annual meeting: (i) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting; (ii) by
or at the direction of the Board of Directors; or (iii) by any shareholder of
the corporation who (A) was a shareholder of record at the time of giving of
notice provided for in this Section, (B) is entitled to vote with respect
thereto and (C) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this
Section. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a
shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing
to the Secretary of the corporation and such proposed business must otherwise
be a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's
notice must be delivered to or mailed to and received by the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of
business on the 60th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 90th
day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting.
Such shareholder's notice to the Secretary of the corporation shall set forth:
(i) as to any business the shareholder proposed to bring before the annual
meeting, (A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before
the annual meeting, (B) the reasons for conducting such business at the annual
meeting, (C) any material interest in such business of such shareholder and
(D) the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and
(ii) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any,
on whose behalf the proposed business is to be brought, (A) the name and
address of such shareholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and
the name and address of such beneficial owner, and (B) the class and number of
shares of the corporation's capital stock that are owned beneficially and of
record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner.

Section 2.2. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be
called for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prohibited by the Iowa
Business Corporation Act, other relevant law, the articles of incorporation or
these bylaws. The Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer or President
may call a special meeting of shareholders. In addition, a special meeting
shall be called in the circumstances described in Section 490.702 of the Iowa
Business Corporation Act.

Section 2.3. Place of Meeting. The Board of Directors may designate any place,
either within or without the State of Iowa, as the place of meeting for any
annual meeting or for any special meeting of the shareholders called pursuant
to Section 2.2. A waiver of notice signed by all shareholders entitled to vote
at a meeting may designate any place, either within or without the State of
Iowa, as the place for the holding of such meeting. If no designation is made,
or if a special meeting be otherwise called, the place of meeting shall be the
registered office of the corporation in the State of Iowa, except as otherwise
provided in Section 2.12 of these bylaws.

Section 2.4. Notice of Meeting. Written or printed notice stating the place,
day and hour of the meeting of shareholders and, in case of a special meeting,
the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered
within the time period prescribed by Section 490.705 of the Iowa Business
Corporation Act, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the
Board of Directors, or, in the absence of such direction, the Chairman of the
Board, Chief Executive Officer or President, or, in the absence of either such
direction, by the Secretary, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at
such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when
deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his or
her address as it then appears on the stock transfer books of the corporation,
with postage thereon prepaid.

Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively
to shareholders, any notice to shareholders given by the corporation under any
provision of the Iowa Business Corporation Act, the articles of incorporation
or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic
transmission consented to by the shareholder to whom notice is given and shall
be deemed delivered immediately upon electronic transmission of such notice.
Any such consent shall be revocable by the shareholder by written notice to
the corporation or as otherwise provided by law. Section 2.5. Fixing of Record Date. For the purpose of determining
shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders
or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any
dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other
proper purpose, the Board of Directors of the corporation may fix in advance a
date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders, such date
in any case to be not more than the number of days set forth in Section
490.707 of the Iowa Business Corporation Act prior to the date on which the
particular action requiring such determination of shareholders is to be taken
and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten days before the
date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed for the determination of
shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or
shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which
notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the
Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be,
shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders. When a
determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders
has been made as provided in this Section, such determination shall apply to
any adjournment thereof.

Section 2.6. Voting Lists. The officer or agent having charge of the stock
transfer books for shares of the corporation shall make a complete list of the
shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof,
arranged, in alphabetical order, by voting group and then by class or series,
with the address of and the number of shares held by each shareholder. The
list shall be available for inspection upon written demand by any shareholder
at any time during usual business hours, at such shareholder's expense,
beginning two business days after the notice of the meeting is given for which
the list was prepared, and continuing through the meeting, at the
corporation's principal address or at a place identified in the meeting notice
in the city where the meeting will be held. Such lists shall also be produced
and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the
inspection of any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting.

Section 2.7. Quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation
entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum
at a meeting of shareholders. If less than a majority of the outstanding
shares are represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented
may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. At such
adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as
originally notified. The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may
continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the
withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.

Section 2.8. Proxies. At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote
by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his or her duly
authorized attorney in fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of
the corporation before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be valid
after eleven months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided
in the proxy. Section 2.9. Voting of Shares. Subject to the articles of incorporation, each
outstanding share entitled to vote shall be entitled to one vote upon each
matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders.

Section 2.10. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders.

(a) Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by such
officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or,
in the absence of such provision, as the Board of Directors of such
corporation may determine.

(b) Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator may be
voted by him or her, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such
shares into his or her name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be
voted by him or her, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be
entitled to vote shares held by him or her without a transfer of such shares
into his or her name.

(c) Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver,
and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such
receiver without the transfer thereof into his or her name if authority so to
do be contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver
was appointed.

(d) A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such
shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee,
and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so
transferred.

(e) Neither treasury shares nor shares held by another corporation if a
majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such
other corporation is held by the corporation, shall be voted at any meeting or
counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given
time.

Section 2.11. Informal Action by Shareholders. Unless otherwise provided by
the articles of incorporation, any action required to be taken at a meeting of
the shareholders, or any other action which may be taken at a meeting of the
shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if one or more written consents
describing the action taken are signed by the holders of outstanding shares
having not less than ninety percent of the votes entitled to be cast at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the action were present and
voted, and are delivered to the corporation for including in the minutes or
filing with the corporate records and the other requirements in Section
490.704 of the Iowa Business Corporation Act are followed.

Section 2.12. Meeting of all Shareholders. If all of the shareholders shall
meet at any time and place, either within or without the State of Iowa, and
consent to the holding of a meeting at such time and place, such meeting shall
be valid without call or notice, and at such meeting any corporate action may
be taken. Section 2.13. Voting by Ballot. Voting on any question or in any election may
be by voice unless the presiding officer shall order or any shareholder shall
demand that voting be by ballot.

ARTICLE III.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Section 3.1. General Powers. The business and affairs of the corporation shall
be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors.

Section 3.2. Number, Tenure, Qualifications. In accordance with Section 2.6 of
the Agreement and Plan of Merger between the corporation and Central
Bancshares, Inc. ("Central"), dated November 20, 2014 (the "Agreement"), the
following provisions shall govern directors to the exclusion of any provision
in these bylaws to the contrary. Terms capitalized but not otherwise defined
in these bylaws shall have the meaning given to them in the Agreement. At the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the corporation, as the Surviving
Corporation, shall consist of thirteen directors who shall consist of: (i)
eight persons serving as directors of the corporation (each, a
"Company‑Related Director") and (ii) five persons serving as directors of
Central (each, a "Central‑Related Director"), in each case serving in such
capacity immediately prior to the Effective Time.

The directors shall be divided into three classes. Immediately following the
Effective Time, the Class I directors shall consist of three Company‑Related
Directors and two Central‑Related Directors, one of whom shall be John M.
Morrison. The initial Class I directors shall hold office for an initial term
expiring at the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders and Class I directors
shall thereafter be elected to three-year terms. At the 2017 annual meeting of
shareholders, Mr. Morrison, if then still serving as a director, shall not
stand for reelection, and, provided that Mr. Morrison has served for the
entirety of his initial term, the Board of Directors shall nominate for
election to Mr. Morrison's seat on the Board of Directors an individual
recommended by Mr. Morrison, provided further that such nomination is
reasonably agreeable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in
accordance with the good faith execution of its duties. If, prior to the 2017
annual meeting of shareholders, Mr. Morrison shall have resigned or been
removed in accordance with these bylaws, the Board of Directors may fill the
resultant vacancy in accordance with Section 3.8 hereof or elect to reduce the
total number of Central‑Related Directors entitled to serve on the Board of
Directors by one, with a corresponding reduction in the total number of
directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. If, prior to the 2017
annual meeting of shareholders, Mr. Morrison shall cease to serve as a
director for any reason other than those set forth in the preceding sentence,
the Board of Directors shall fill the resultant vacancy with an individual
selected by the Central‑Related Directors in good faith in a manner intended
to preserve the principles of representation in these bylaws, provided that
such individual is reasonably agreeable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the good
faith execution of its duties, and upon the expiration of such individual's
initial term at the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, shall nominate such
individual, provided again that such nomination is reasonably agreeable to the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the good
faith execution of its duties, for an additional term to expire at the 2020
annual meeting of shareholders. Upon the expiration of his or her initial
term, the Class I Central‑Related Director other than Mr. Morrison (the
"Remaining Class I Central‑Related Director") shall be nominated by the Board
of Directors, provided that such nomination is reasonably agreeable to the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the good
faith execution of its duties, for an additional term to expire at the 2020
annual meeting of shareholders. If, prior to the 2020 annual meeting of
shareholders, the Remaining Class I Central‑Related Director shall for any
reason cease to serve as a director or shall not stand for reelection as a
director, the resultant vacancy shall be filled by the Board of Directors with
an individual selected by the Central‑Related Directors in good faith in a
manner intended to preserve the principles of representation in these bylaws,
provided that such individual is reasonably agreeable to the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the good faith execution of
its duties, which such individual, if appointed to the Board of Directors
prior to the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, will be nominated by the
Board of Directors for reelection at such annual meeting, provided again that
such nomination is reasonably agreeable to the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee in accordance with the good faith execution of its
duties, for an additional term to expire at the 2020 annual meeting of
shareholders.

Immediately following the Effective Time, the Class II directors shall consist
of two Company‑Related Directors and two Central‑Related Directors. The
initial Class II directors shall hold office for an initial term expiring at
the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders and Class II directors shall
thereafter be elected to three‑year terms. Upon the expiration of their
initial terms, the initial Class II Central‑Related Directors shall be
nominated by the Board of Directors, provided that such nominations are
reasonably agreeable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in
accordance with the good faith execution of its duties, for an additional term
to expire at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, and, upon the expiration
of such subsequent term, to an additional term to expire at the 2021 annual
meeting of shareholders. If, prior to the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders,
either Class II Central‑Related Director shall for any reason cease to serve
as a director or shall not stand for reelection as a director, the resultant
vacancy shall be filled by the Board of Directors with an individual selected
by the Central‑Related Directors in good faith in a manner intended to
preserve the principles of representation in these bylaws, provided that such
individual is reasonably agreeable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee in accordance with the good faith execution of its duties, which
such individual, if appointed to the Board of Directors prior to the 2018
annual meeting of shareholders, will be nominated for reelection by the Board
of Directors, provided again that such nomination is reasonably agreeable to
the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the good
faith execution of its duties, for any additional terms expiring at or before
the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders. Immediately following the Effective Time, the Class III directors shall
consist of three Company‑Related Directors and one Central‑Related Director,
who shall be Larry Albert. The initial Class III directors shall hold office
for an initial term expiring at the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders and
Class III directors shall thereafter be elected to three‑year terms. At the
2016 annual meeting of shareholders, the Class III Central‑Related Director
shall not stand for reelection, upon which time the total number of
Central‑Related Directors entitled to serve on the Board of Directors shall be
reduced by one, with a corresponding reduction in the total number of
directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. If, prior to the 2016
annual meeting of shareholders, the Class III Central‑Related Director shall
for any reason cease to serve as a director, the reduction in the number of
Central‑Related Directors entitled to serve on the Board of Directors and
corresponding reduction in the total number of directors constituting the
entire Board of Directors shall be accelerated to the date on which such Class
III Central‑Related Director ceases to serve.

If, prior to the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, any Company‑Related
Director shall for any reason cease to serve as a director or shall not stand
for reelection as a director, he or she shall be replaced by the Board of
Directors with an individual selected by the Company‑Related Directors in good
faith in a manner intended to preserve the principles of representation in
these bylaws, provided that such individual is reasonably agreeable to the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the good
faith execution of its duties.

Following, the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, the number of directors
constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be not less than eleven nor
more than fifteen, as fixed from time to time by resolution of not less than a
majority of the number of directors that, immediately prior to such proposed
change, had been fixed in the manner prescribed by this Section 3.2; provided,
however, that the number of directors shall not be reduced so as to shorten
the term of any director at the time in office. Directors need not be
shareholders of the corporation.

The Board of Directors may appoint individuals to serve as honorary directors
or as directors emeritus. An individual so appointed shall not vote at any
meeting of the Board of Directors, shall not be counted in determining a
quorum, and shall not be charged with any responsibilities or be subject to
any liabilities imposed upon directors. Provided that Mr. Morrison serves for
the entirety of his initial term on the Board of Directors, he shall serve as
a director emeritus from the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders until the
180th day following the fourth anniversary of the Effective Time.

Section 3.3. Regular Meetings. A regular meeting of the Board of Directors
shall be held without notice (other than this Section of these bylaws)
immediately after the annual meeting of shareholders. The Board of Directors
may provide, by resolution, the time and place, either within or without the
State of Iowa, for the holding of additional regular meetings without other
notice than such resolution.

Section 3.4. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may
be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer or President; special meetings shall be called by the Chairman, Chief
Executive Officer, President or Secretary in like manner and on like notices
upon the written request of a majority of the directors. The person or persons
authorized to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix any
place, either within or without the State of Iowa, as the place for holding any special meeting of
the Board of Directors called by them.

Section 3.5. Notice. Notice of any special meeting of the Board of Directors
shall be given at least twenty-four hours in advance by written notice
delivered personally or mailed to each director at his or her business
address, or by telephone, facsimile or other means of electronic transmission
to the directors. If mailed, such notice shall be deposited in the U.S. mail,
postage prepaid, at least four business days prior to the meeting. Any
director may waive notice of any meeting. The attendance of a director at a
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when a
director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the
notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.

Section 3.6. Quorum. A majority of the number of directors designated by the
Board of Directors as constituting the full Board shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors, but
if less than such majority is present at a meeting, a majority of the
directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further
notice.

Section 3.7. Manner of Acting; Actions Requiring Supermajority Approval.

(a) Except as provided below or as otherwise provided in these bylaws, the act
of the majority of the Board of Directors present at a meeting at which a

City, Iowa to another city;

(iii) the removal of any member of the Board of Directors;

(iv) the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of the corporation to an unaffiliated entity, or a merger,
combination or other similar transaction pursuant to which an unaffiliated
party will own or control twenty-five percent or more of the outstanding stock
of the corporation; or (v) the issuance of securities requiring the approval of the corporation's
shareholders pursuant to NASDAQ Rule 5635(a) or (b), or similar rules of any
other national securities exchange upon which the corporation's securities are
listed; or

(vi) the amendment of Sections 3.2, 3.7, 3.8, 3.14, 4.2, and 4.3 and Article
XIII of these bylaws.

Directors shall consist of: (i) sixty-seven percent of the full Board of
Directors at any time five Central‑Related Directors are entitled to serve;
and (ii) seventy‑five percent of the full Board of Directors at any time there
are fewer than five Central‑Related Directors entitled to serve.

Section 3.8. Vacancies. Subject to Section 3.2, in case one or more vacancies
shall occur on the Board of Directors by reason of death, resignation, an
increase in the number of directors or otherwise, the vacancy may be filled by
the Board of Directors, or, if the directors remaining in office constitute
fewer than a quorum of the Board of Directors, by the affirmative vote of a
majority of all such directors remaining in office.

Section 3.9. Compensation. By resolution of the Board of Directors, the
directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of
the Board of Directors, and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each
meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated salary as director. No such
payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other
capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

Section 3.10. Presumption of Assent. A director of the corporation who is
present at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which action on any
corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action
taken unless his or her dissent shall be entered into the minutes of the
meeting or unless he or she shall file his or her written dissent to such
action with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the
adjournment thereof or shall forward such dissent by registered mail to the
Secretary of the corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting.
Such right to dissent shall not apply to a director who voted in favor of such
action.

Section 3.11. Informal Action by Directors. Any action required to be taken at
a meeting of the directors, or any other action which may be taken at a
meeting of the directors, may be taken without a meeting if a consent in

directors entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof.

Section 3.12. Appointment of Certain Board Committees. The Board of Directors
may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board, designate one or
more committees, each committee to consist of one or more directors of the
corporation. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of
the Board of Directors and permitted by the Iowa Business Corporation Act,

attendance and presence in person at the meeting of the person or persons so
participating.

Section 3.14. Director Nominations. Subject to Section 3.2, nominations of
candidates for election as directors at any meeting of shareholders may be
made: (i) by, or at the direction of, a majority of the Board of Directors or
a designated committee thereof; or (ii) by any shareholder of record entitled
to vote at such meeting; provided that only persons nominated in accordance
with procedures set forth in this Section shall be eligible for election as
directors; provided further that no person, other than John M. Morrison (who
shall be eligible to serve through the annual meeting of shareholders held in
2017 regardless of his age) shall be eligible for election to the Board of
Directors if such person has attained the age of seventy-two years prior to
the date of the meeting of shareholders at which such person would be elected.

Nominations, other than those made by, or at the direction of, the Board of

To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to, or mailed and

less than sixty days nor more than ninety days in advance of the first
anniversary date (month and day) of the previous year's annual meeting; and
(ii) for a special meeting, not less than sixty days nor more than ninety days
in advance of the date (month and day) of the special meeting, regardless of

14A under the Exchange Act, in connection with the solicitation of proxies
with respect to nominees for election as directors; and (ii) as to the
shareholder giving the notice, (A) the name and address, as they appear on the
corporation's books, of such shareholder and the name and principal business
or residential address of any other beneficial shareholders known by such
shareholder to support such nominees, and (B) the class and number of shares
of the corporation's stock which are beneficially owned by such shareholder on
the date of such shareholder notice and the number of shares owned
beneficially by any other record or beneficial shareholders known by such
shareholder to be supporting such nominees on the date of such shareholder
notice. At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by, or
at the request of, the Board of Directors for election as a director shall
furnish to the Secretary of the corporation that information required to be
set forth in a shareholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the
nominee. The Board of Directors may reject any nomination by a shareholder not timely
made in accordance with the requirements of this Section. If the Board of
Directors, or a committee designated by the Board of Directors, determines
that the information provided in a shareholder's notice does not satisfy the
informational requirements of this Section in any material respect, the
Secretary of the corporation shall promptly notify such shareholder of the
deficiency in the notice. The shareholder may cure the deficiency by providing
additional information to the Secretary within such period of time, not less
than five days from the date such deficiency notice is given to the
shareholder, as the Board of Directors or such committee shall determine. If
the deficiency is not cured within such period, or if the Board of Directors
or a designated committee determines that the additional information provided
by the shareholder, together with information previously provided, does not
satisfy the requirements of this Section in any material respect, then the
Board of Directors may reject such shareholder's notice and the proposed
nominations shall not be accepted if presented at the shareholder meeting to
which the notice relates.

ARTICLE XII.

INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

Section 12.1. Indemnification of Officers and Directors. The corporation shall
indemnify and advance expenses to any person who was or is a party or witness,
or is threatened to be made a party or witness, to any threatened, pending or
completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, including grand jury proceedings, by reason
of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
corporation or, while a director or officer of the corporation is, or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a member, director, trustee,
officer, partner, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic
corporation, or of a partnership, company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against
reasonable costs, charges, expenses, attorney's fees, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts reasonably paid in settlement to the extent actually
incurred by such person in connection with such claim, action, suit or
proceeding, or in connection with an appeal thereof, to the full extent of and
in a manner consistent with and limited by federal or state banking law and
regulation or the Iowa Business Corporation Act, as the same now exists or may
hereafter be amended or changed, or any successor or substitute law. No
amendment to or repeal of this Article XII shall apply to or have any effect
on the rights of any individual referred to in this Article XII for or with
respect to acts or omissions of such individual occurring prior to such
amendment or repeal.

Entitlement to indemnification under this Section 12.1 shall be conditional
upon the corporation being afforded the opportunity to participate directly on
behalf of such person in such claim, action, suit or proceeding or any
settlement discussions relating thereto. The rights to indemnification
hereunder shall be construed to be a contract between the corporation and each
person who is now serving or who shall hereafter serve as a director or
officer of the corporation. Each person who is now serving or who shall
hereafter serve as a director or officer of the corporation shall be deemed to
be serving in reliance upon the rights to identification provided hereunder,
and such rights to indemnification shall continue as to any person who has
ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs
and personal representative of such person.

Section 12.2. Other Rights. The indemnification provided hereunder shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the persons indemnified may
be entitled under any agreement, vote of disinterested directors or otherwise,
both as to activity in such person's official capacity and as to activity in
another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person
who has ceased to be a director of officer. Section 12.3. Insurance. The corporation, at its expense, shall have the power
to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of the corporation and on behalf
of its directors and officers against any liability asserted against such
persons in their capacities as directors and officers or arising out of their
status as directors and officers, whether or not the corporation would have
the power to indemnify the director or officer against such liability
hereunder or under the Iowa Business Corporation Act. The corporation's
obligation to indemnify hereunder shall be in excess of any insurance purchase
and maintained by the corporation, but such insurance shall be the primary
source of satisfaction of such obligation of the corporation. To the extent
that indemnification is paid to or on behalf of a director or officer by such
insurance, such payments shall be deemed to be in satisfaction of the
corporation's obligation to indemnify such director or officer.

Section 12.4. Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Board of Directors
of the corporation by resolution may provide indemnification by the
corporation to any employee or agent of the corporation, other than a director
and officer, to the extent provided hereunder for directors and officers of
the corporation.

 Exhibit D-2

AMENDED AND RESTATED

BYLAWS



OF



MIDWESTONE BANK

(Iowa City, Iowa)







The board of directors of the MidWestOne Bank has duly adopted the following
as and for the bylaws of said bank:



ARTICLE I



SHAREHOLDER(S)



1.1 Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of the shareholder(s) shall be held in
the month of April in each year on such day and at such time as shall be
designated by the board of directors and stated in the notice of such meeting
(if any) for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such
other business as may come before such meeting. If the election of the
directors shall not be accomplished on the day designated in accordance
herewith for any annual meeting of the shareholder(s), or at any adjournment
thereof, the board of directors shall cause the election by the shareholder(s)
to be accomplished at a special meeting of the shareholder(s) to be held as
soon thereafter as conveniently may be.



1.2 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholder(s) for any purpose
or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute, may be called by the
chairman of the board, the president, the board of directors or the holder(s)
of not less than one-tenth of all the shares entitled to vote at the meeting.



1.3 Place of Meetings. All annual and special meetings of the shareholder(s)
shall be held at the principal place of business of the bank unless the board
of directors designates a different place within Iowa for any such meeting,
but any meeting may be adjourned to recommence at any place within Iowa.



1.4 Notice of Meetings. Written or printed notice stating the place, day and
hour of the meeting, and in the case of any special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the special meeting is called shall be delivered not less
than ten days (unless a longer period is required by any statute) nor more
than sixty days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by
ordinary mail by or at the direction of the president, or the officer or
persons calling the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the U.S. mail
addressed to the shareholder at his or her address as appears on the stock
transfer records of the bank with postage thereon prepaid. A written waiver of
notice signed by the shareholder before or after the time of the meeting shall
be deemed equivalent to the timely giving of such notice.



Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively
to the shareholder(s), any notice to the shareholder(s) given by the bank
under any provision of the Iowa Banking Act, the articles of incorporation or
these bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission
consented to by the shareholder to whom notice is given and shall be deemed
delivered immediately upon electronic transmission of such notice. Any such
consent shall be revocable by the shareholder by written notice to the bank or
as otherwise provided by law.

1.5 Fixing of Record Date. The board of directors shall fix in advance a date
as the record date for the determination of who is a shareholder for any
purpose. Such date in any case shall be not more than seventy days and, in the
case of a meeting of the shareholder(s), not less than ten days prior to the
meeting date.



1.6 Voting Lists. The officer having charge of the stock transfer books for
shares of the bank shall make, at least ten days before each meeting of the
shareholder(s), a list of the shareholder(s) entitled to vote at such meeting,
arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares
held, which list, for a period of ten days prior to such meeting, shall be
kept on file at the principal office of the bank and shall be subject to
inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual business hours. The
shareholder list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of
the meeting and is subject to the inspection of a shareholder, or a
shareholder's agent or attorney, during the whole time of the meeting. Failure
to comply with the requirements of this section shall not affect the validity
of any action taken at such meeting.



1.7 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, a majority of the shares
entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum
at a meeting of the shareholder(s) and a majority of the shares represented at
the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the
shareholder(s). Though less than a quorum of the outstanding shares are
represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn
the meeting from time to time without further notice. At such adjourned
meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be
transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
notified.



1.8 Voting. Subject to the provisions of Section 538 of the Iowa Banking Act,
each outstanding share entitled to vote shall be entitled to one vote upon
each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of the shareholder(s). At each
election for directors each shareholder entitled to vote at such election
shall have the right to vote, in person or by proxy, the number of shares
owned for as many persons as there are directors to be elected. Nothing herein
shall prevent the shareholder(s) from voting for directors by casting of a
unanimous vote of all stock represented in favor of the persons nominated for
directors where not more than the number of persons to be elected as directors
has been nominated.

 1.9 Participation by Means of Electronic Equipment. The shareholder(s) may
participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through
the use of, any means of communication by which all shareholders participating
may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. A shareholder
participating in a meeting as provided herein is deemed to be present in
person at the meeting.



1.10 Action by Written Consent in Lieu of Special Meeting. Any action required
or permitted to be taken at a special meeting of the shareholder(s) may be
taken without a meeting if the action is consented to by all shareholder(s).
The action must be evidenced by a written consent describing the action taken,
signed by each shareholder, and included in the minutes or filed with the
corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under this section
is effective when the last shareholder signs the consent, unless the consent
specifies a different effective date. A written consent signed under this
section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any
document.





ARTICLE II



BOARD OF DIRECTORS





2.1 General Powers. The business and affairs of this bank shall be managed by
a board of five or more qualified directors who shall have the duties and
responsibilities set forth in the Iowa Banking Act.



2.2 Number, Tenure and Qualifications. In accordance with Section 2.9 of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger between MidWestOne Financial Group, Inc. and
Central Bancshares, Inc., dated November 20, 2014 (the "Agreement"), the
following provisions shall govern directors to the exclusion of any provision
in these bylaws to the contrary. Terms capitalized but not otherwise defined
in this Section shall have the meaning given to them in the Agreement. The
number of directors in excess of five shall be determined from time to time by
resolution adopted by the holder(s) of a majority of the outstanding shares of
the bank's common stock, provided that, at the Effective Time, three of the
directors shall be persons serving as directors of Central Bank immediately
prior to the Effective Time.



Each director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the
shareholder(s) and until his or her successor shall have been elected and
shall qualify, or until his or her death or until he or she shall resign or
shall have been removed from office in a manner provided by Section 606 of the
Iowa Banking Act. A director may resign by filing his or her written
resignation with the chairman of the board of directors and president. Each
director shall be over eighteen and under seventy-two years of age at the time
of election, a citizen of the United States, and a majority of the directors
shall be citizens of the State of Iowa. The age restrictions otherwise
applicable to a particular director may be waived each year by majority vote
of the directors other than the director so affected.

 The board of directors may appoint individuals to serve as honorary directors
or as directors emeritus pursuant to the provisions of Section 614 of the Iowa
Banking Act. An individual so appointed shall not vote at any meeting of the
board of directors, shall not be counted in determining a quorum, and shall
not be charged with any responsibilities or be subject to any liabilities
imposed upon directors.



2.3 Regular Meetings. A regular meeting of the board of directors shall be
held without other notice than this bylaw at least once in each calendar month
at a time and place to be fixed from time to time by resolution of the board
of directors.



2.4 Special Meetings. A special meeting of the board of directors may be
called by the chairman of the board, by the president, or by any director.



2.5 Notice of Meetings. Notice of any special meeting shall be given to each
director either personally, by telephone, mail, facsimile or other means of
electronic transmission, at least two days in advance of such meeting. If
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the U.S.
mail with postage thereon prepaid. Whenever any notice is required to be given
to any director under the articles of incorporation or bylaws or any provision
of law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed at any time, whether before or
after the time of meeting, by the director entitled to such notice, shall be
deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. The attendance of a director
at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where
a director attends a meeting and objects thereat to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the
business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special
meeting of the board need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of
such meeting.



2.6 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the articles of
incorporation or by these bylaws, a majority of the number of directors fixed
by Section 2.2 hereof shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business at any meeting of the board, but a majority of the directors present
(though less than such quorum) may adjourn the meeting from time to time
without further notice.



2.7 Manner of Acting. The act of the majority of the directors present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board, unless the
act of a greater number is required by law or by the articles or by these
bylaws.



2.8 Director Vacancies. Any single vacancy occurring in the board, including a
single vacancy created by an increase in the number of directors, may be
filled until the next succeeding annual meeting of the shareholder(s) by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, provided that
if at any time there is a simultaneous vacancy of two or more directors, such
multiple vacancies shall be filled by vote of the shareholder(s) at a special
meeting of the shareholder(s) to be called for such purpose to be held at the
earliest possible date following the occurrence of such multiple vacancies. Any director so elected shall hold office until the
next annual meeting of the shareholder(s), and until his or her successor is
elected and shall qualify.



2.9 Fees. The shareholder(s) shall fix the reasonable compensation of
directors for their services as members of the board of directors. The

Directors may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in the
performance of their duties.



2.10 Presumption of Assent. A director of the bank who is present at a meeting
of the board or a committee thereof at which action on any bank matter is
taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless he or she
shall file his or her written dissent to such action with the person acting as
the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall forward
such dissent by certified mail to the secretary of the board immediately after
the adjournment of the meeting. In the alternative, a negative vote may be
recorded by a director so requesting at the time the vote is taken. Such right
to dissent shall not apply to a director who voted in favor of such action at
the meeting.



2.11 Board Committees. Subject to the provisions of Section 609 of the Iowa
Banking Act, the board of directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of
the full board of directors, may designate from its members one or more board
committees. Each board committee shall perform the duties specified and
provided in such resolution of the board.



2.12 Participation by Means of Electronic Equipment. The board of directors
may permit directors to participate in meetings through the use of any means
of communication by which all directors participating may simultaneously hear
each other during the meeting. A director participating in a meeting by this
means is deemed to be present at the meeting.



2.13 Action by Written Consent. Any action required or permitted to be taken
under this chapter at a board of directors' meeting may be taken without a
meeting if the action is consented to by all members of the board. The action
must be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken,
signed by each director, and included in the minutes or filed with the
corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under this section
is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the consent

stand on the stock records of the bank shall be deemed the owner thereof for
all purposes as regards the bank.





ARTICLE V



INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,

EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS



5.1. Indemnification of Officers and Directors. The corporation shall
indemnify and advance expenses to any person who was or is a party or witness,
or is threatened to be made a party or witness, to any threatened, pending or
completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, including grand jury proceedings, by reason
of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the bank or,
while a director or officer of the bank is, or was serving at the request of the bank as a member, director, trustee,
officer, partner, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic
corporation, or of a partnership, company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against
reasonable costs, charges, expenses, attorney's fees, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts reasonably paid in settlement to the extent actually
incurred by such person in connection with such claim, action, suit or
proceeding, or in connection with an appeal thereof, to the full extent of and
in a manner consistent with and limited by federal or state banking law and
regulation or the Iowa Banking Act, as the same now exists or may hereafter be
amended or changed, or any successor or substitute law. No amendment to or
repeal of this Article V shall apply to or have any effect on the rights of
any individual referred to in this Article V for or with respect to acts or
omissions of such individual occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

Entitlement to indemnification under this Section 5.1 shall be conditional
upon the bank being afforded the opportunity to participate directly on behalf
of such person in such claim, action, suit or proceeding or any settlement
discussions relating thereto. The rights to indemnification hereunder shall be
construed to be a contract between the bank and each person who is now serving
or who shall hereafter serve as a director or officer of the bank. Each person
who is now serving or who shall hereafter serve as a director or officer of
the bank shall be deemed to be serving in reliance upon the rights to
identification provided hereunder, and such rights to indemnification shall
continue as to any person who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs and personal representative of such person.

5.2. Other Rights. The indemnification provided hereunder shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which the persons indemnified may be entitled
under any bylaw, agreement, vote of disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to activity in such person's official capacity and as to activity in
another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person
who has ceased to be a director of officer.

5.3. Insurance. The bank, at its expense, shall have the power to purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of the bank and on behalf of its directors and
officers against any liability asserted against such persons in their
capacities as directors and officers or arising out of their status as
directors and officers, whether or not the bank would have the power to
indemnify the director or officer against such liability hereunder or under
the Iowa Banking Act. The bank's obligation to indemnify hereunder shall be in
excess of any insurance purchase and maintained by the bank, but such
insurance shall be the primary source of satisfaction of such obligation of
the bank. To the extent that indemnification is paid to or on behalf of a
director or officer by such insurance, such payments shall be deemed to be in
satisfaction of the bank's obligation to indemnify such director or officer.

5.4. Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The board of directors of the
bank by resolution may provide indemnification by the bank to any employee or
agent of the bank, other than directors and officers, to the extent provided
hereunder for directors and officers of the bank.



 ARTICLE VI

BYLAWS



OF



CENTRAL BANK,

A MINNESOTA BANKING CORPORATION OF

GOLDEN VALLEY, MINNESOTA







The board of directors of Central Bank has duly adopted the following as and
for the bylaws of said bank:





ARTICLE I



SHAREHOLDER(S)



1.1 Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of the shareholder(s) shall be held on
the third Thursday succeeding the first Monday of January of each year between
the hours of 9:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M., or such other date set in accordance
with applicable laws, for the purpose of electing directors and for the
transaction of such other business as may come before such meeting; provided
that, if an annual meeting has not been held during the immediately preceding
fifteen (15) months, a shareholder or shareholders holding three percent (3%)
or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote may demand an
annual meeting of shareholders by written notice of demand given to the chief
executive officer or treasurer of the bank. If the election of the directors
shall not be accomplished on the day designated in accordance herewith for any
annual meeting of the shareholder(s), or at any adjournment thereof, the board
of directors shall cause the election by the shareholder(s) to be accomplished
at a special meeting of the shareholder(s) to be held as soon thereafter as
conveniently may be. Three (3) judges, who shall be appointed by the board of
directors, shall hold and conduct every election of directors. The judges of
election shall hold and conduct the election at which they are appointed to
serve. After the election, they shall file with the secretary a certificate
signed by them, certifying the result thereof and the names of the directors
elected. The judges of election, at the request of the chairperson of the
board, shall act as tellers of any other vote by ballot taken at such meeting,
and shall certify the result thereof.



1.2 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholder(s) for any purpose
or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute, may be called by the
chief executive officer, treasurer, chairman of the board, the president, two
(2) or more directors or the holder(s) of not less than ten percent (10%) of
all the shares entitled to vote at the meeting who shall demand such special meeting by giving written notice of demand to the chief executive officer or
the treasurer specifying the purposes of the meeting.



1.3 Meetings Held Upon Shareholder Demand. Within thirty (30) days after
receipt by the chief executive officer or the treasurer of a demand from any
shareholder(s) entitled to call an annual or special meeting of shareholders,
the board of directors shall cause such meeting to be called and held on
notice no later than ninety (90) days after receipt of such demand. If the
board of directors fails to cause such a meeting to be called and held, the
shareholder(s) making the demand may call the meeting by giving notice as
provided in Section 1.5 hereof at the expense of the bank.



1.4 Place of Meetings. All annual and special meetings of the shareholder(s)
shall be held at the principal place of business of the bank unless the board
of directors designates a different place, within or without the State of
Minnesota, for any such meeting, except that an annual or special meeting
called by or at the demand of a shareholder shall be held in the county where
the principal place of business of the bank is located.



1.5 Notice of Meetings. Written or printed notice stating the place, day and
hour of the meeting, and in the case of any special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the special meeting is called shall be delivered not less
than ten (10) days (unless a longer period is required by any statute) nor
more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, either personally or
by ordinary mail by or at the direction of the president, or the officer or
persons calling the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be
delivered when deposited in the U.S. mail addressed to the shareholder at his
or her address as appears on the stock transfer records of the bank with
postage thereon prepaid. A shareholder may waive notice of any meeting before,
at or after the meeting, in writing, orally or by attendance. Attendance at a
meeting by a shareholder is a waiver of notice of that meeting unless the
shareholder objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or objects
before a vote on an item of business because the item may not be lawfully
considered at such meeting and does not participate in the consideration of
the item at such meeting.



Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively
to the shareholder(s), any notice to the shareholder(s) given by the bank
under any provision of the Minnesota Statutes, the certificate of
incorporation or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of
electronic transmission consented to by the shareholder to whom notice is
given and shall be deemed delivered immediately upon electronic transmission
of such notice. Any such consent shall be revocable by the shareholder by
written notice to the bank or as otherwise provided by law.

1.6 Fixing of Record Date. The board of directors shall fix in advance a date
as the record date for the determination of who is a shareholder for any
purpose. Such date in any case shall be not more than sixty (60) days and, in
the case of a meeting of the shareholder(s), not less than ten (10) days prior
to the meeting date.



1.7 Voting Lists. The officer having charge of the stock transfer books for
shares of the bank shall make, at least ten (10) days before each meeting of
the shareholder(s), a list of the shareholder(s) entitled to vote at such
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held, which list, for a period of ten (10) days prior
to such meeting, shall be kept on file at the principal office of the bank and
shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual
business hours. The shareholder list shall also be produced and kept open at
the time and place of the meeting and is subject to the inspection of a
shareholder, or a shareholder's agent or attorney, during the whole time of
the meeting. Failure to comply with the requirements of this section shall not
affect the validity of any action taken at such meeting.



1.8 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, a majority of the shares
entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum
at a meeting of the shareholder(s) and a majority of the shares represented at
the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the
shareholder(s), except that all elections for directors shall be decided by a
plurality of the voting power of the shares present and entitled to vote on
the election of directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present, unless
otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is present
when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the shareholder(s) present may
continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of
a number of shares originally present leaves less than the proportion or
number otherwise required for a quorum. Though less than a quorum of the
outstanding shares are represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so
represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.
At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented,
any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting
as originally notified.



1.9 Voting. Each outstanding share entitled to vote shall be entitled to one
(1) vote upon each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of the
shareholder(s). At each election for directors each shareholder entitled to
vote at such election shall have the right to vote, in person or by proxy, the
number of shares owned for as many persons as there are directors to be
elected. Nothing herein shall prevent the shareholder(s) from voting for
directors by casting of a unanimous vote of all stock represented in favor of
the persons nominated for directors where not more than the number of persons
to be elected as directors has been nominated.



1.10 Participation by Means of Electronic Equipment. The shareholder(s) may
participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through
the use of, any means of communication by which all shareholders participating
may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. The bank shall
implement reasonable measures to verify that each shareholder deemed present
by means of remote communication and entitled to vote at the shareholder
meeting is a shareholder and to provide each shareholder participating by
means of remote communication with a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the shareholders. A
shareholder participating in a meeting as provided herein is deemed to be
present in person at the meeting.



1.11 Action by Written Consent in Lieu of Special Meeting. Any action required
or permitted to be taken at a special meeting of the shareholder(s) may be
taken without a meeting if the action is consented to by all shareholders. The
action must be evidenced by a written consent describing the action taken,
signed by each shareholder, and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under this
section is effective when the last shareholder signs the consent, unless the
consent specifies a different effective date. A written consent signed under
this section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in
any document.



1.12 Increase of Capital. Whenever an increase of stock shall be determined
upon, in accordance with law, it shall be the duty of the board of directors
to notify the shareholder(s) of the same, and cause a subscription list to be
opened for such increase of capital. Upon such increase each shareholder shall
have the privilege of subscribing for new stock in proportion to the amount of
stock then owned by him, her or it. If any shareholder should fail, within the
time specified by the board of directors, to subscribe for the amount of stock
to which he, she or it may be entitled, the board of directors may determine
what disposition shall be made of the privilege of subscribing for the
unsubscribed stock.





ARTICLE II



BOARD OF DIRECTORS



2.1 General Powers. The business and affairs of this bank shall be managed by
a board of not fewer than five (5) nor more than ten (10) directors who shall
have the duties and responsibilities set forth in the Minnesota Statutes.



2.2 Number, Tenure and Qualifications. In accordance with Section 2.9 of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger between Kundla and Central, dated November 20,
2014 (the "Agreement"), the following provisions shall govern directors to the
exclusion of any provision in these bylaws to the contrary. Terms capitalized
but not otherwise defined in this section shall have the meaning given to them
in the Agreement. The number of directors in excess of five (5) shall be
determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the holder(s) of a
majority of the outstanding shares of the bank's common stock, provided that,
at the Effective Time, there shall be a total of ten (10) directors, three (3)
of whom shall be persons serving as directors or officers of Kundla or Kundla
Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time.



Each director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the
shareholder(s) and until his or her successor shall have been elected and
shall qualify, or until his or her death or until he or she shall resign or
shall have been removed from office in a manner provided by Section 2.9
hereof. A director may resign by filing his or her written resignation with
the chairman of the board of directors and president. Each director shall be
over eighteen (18) and under seventy-two (72) years of age at the time of
election and a citizen of the United States. The age restrictions otherwise
applicable to a particular director may be waived each year by majority vote
of the directors other than the director so affected.



The board of directors may appoint individuals to serve as honorary directors
or as directors emeritus. An individual so appointed shall not vote at any
meeting of the board of directors, shall not be counted in determining a quorum, and shall not be charged with any
responsibilities or be subject to any liabilities imposed upon directors.



2.3 Regular Meetings. A regular meeting of the board of directors shall be
held without other notice than this bylaw at least once in each calendar month
at a time and place to be fixed from time to time by resolution of the board
of directors.

and place of the meeting, shall be given to each director either personally,
by telephone, mail, facsimile or other means of electronic transmission, at
least two (2) days in advance of such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be
deemed to be delivered when deposited in the U.S. mail with postage thereon
prepaid. Whenever any notice is required to be given to any director under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any provision of law, a director may
waive notice of any meeting before, at or after the meeting, in writing,
orally or by attendance. Attendance at a meeting by a director is a waiver of
notice of that meeting unless the director objects at the beginning of the
meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened and does not participate thereafter in the meeting. Neither
the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special
meeting of the board need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of
such meeting.



2.6 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the certificate of
incorporation or by these bylaws, a majority of the number of directors fixed
pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business at any meeting of the board, but a majority of the directors
present (though less than such quorum) may adjourn the meeting from time to
time without further notice.



2.7 Manner of Acting. The act of the majority of the directors present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board, unless the
act of a greater number is required by law or by the certificate of
incorporation or by these bylaws.



2.8 Director Vacancies. Any vacancy occurring in the board, including a
vacancy created by an increase in the number of directors, may be filled until
the next succeeding annual meeting of the shareholder(s) by vote of the
shareholder(s) at a special meeting of the shareholder(s) to be called for
such purpose to be held at the earliest possible date following the occurrence
of such vacancy. Any director so elected shall hold office until the next
annual meeting of the shareholder(s), and until his or her successor is
elected and shall qualify.



2.9 Removal of Directors. A director may be removed with or without cause, as
determined by the affirmative vote of the holder(s) of at least a majority of
the shares then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
(considered for this purpose as one class) cast at an annual meeting of the
shareholder(s) or at a special meeting of the shareholder(s) called expressly for that purpose. The successor or successors to any director or directors so
removed may be elected by the shareholder(s) at the meeting at which removal
was effectuated.



2.10 Fees. The shareholder(s) shall fix the reasonable compensation of
directors for their services as members of the board of directors. The
shareholder(s) may adopt a pension or profit‑sharing plan, or both, or other
plan of deferred compensation for directors, to which the bank may contribute.
Directors may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in the
performance of their duties.



2.11 Presumption of Assent. A director of the bank who is present at a meeting
of the board or a committee thereof at which action on any bank matter is
taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless he or she
shall file his or her written dissent to such action with the person acting as
the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall forward
such dissent by certified mail to the secretary of the board immediately after
the adjournment of the meeting. In the alternative, a negative vote may be

the meeting.

2.13 Participation by Means of Electronic Equipment. The board of directors
may permit directors to participate in meetings through the use of any means
of communication by which all directors participating may simultaneously hear
each other during the meeting. A director participating in a meeting by this
means is deemed to be present at the meeting.



2.14 Action by Written Consent. Any action required or permitted to be taken
under this chapter at a board of directors' meeting may be taken without a
meeting if the action is consented to by all members of the board. The action
must be evidenced by one (1) or more written consents describing the action
taken, signed by each director, and included in the minutes or filed with the
corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under this section
is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the consent
specifies a different effective date. A written consent signed under this
section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any
document.

audit, and also to show those assets, excluding marketable securities and
fixed assets, which are carried on the books for more than actual value. This
report shall be retained as a permanent record.

ARTICLE V



INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,

EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS



5.1 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. The bank shall indemnify and
advance expenses to any person who was or is a party or witness, or is
threatened to be made a party or witness, to any threatened, pending or
completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, including grand jury proceedings, by reason
of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the bank or,
while a director or officer of the bank is, or was serving at the request of
the bank as a member, director, trustee, officer, partner, employee or agent
of another foreign or domestic corporation, or of a partnership, company,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans, against reasonable costs, charges, expenses,
attorney's fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts reasonably paid in
settlement to the extent actually incurred by such person in connection with
such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with an appeal
thereof, to the full extent of and in a manner consistent with and limited by
federal or state banking law and regulation or the Minnesota Statutes, as the
same now exists or may hereafter be amended or changed, or any successor or
substitute law. No amendment to or repeal of this Article V shall apply to or
have any effect on the rights of any individual referred to in this Article V
for or with respect to acts or omissions of such individual occurring prior to
such amendment or repeal.

Entitlement to indemnification under this Section 5.1 shall be conditional
upon the bank being afforded the opportunity to participate directly on behalf
of such person in such claim, action, suit or proceeding or any settlement
discussions relating thereto. The rights to indemnification hereunder shall be
construed to be a contract between the bank and each person who is now serving
or who shall hereafter serve as a director or officer of the bank. Each person
who is now serving or who shall hereafter serve as a director or officer of
the bank shall be deemed to be serving in reliance upon the rights to
identification provided hereunder, and such rights to indemnification shall
continue as to any person who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs and personal representative of such person.

5.2 Other Rights. The indemnification provided hereunder shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which the persons indemnified may be entitled
under any bylaw, agreement, vote of disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to activity in such person's official capacity and as to activity in
another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person
who has ceased to be a director or officer.

5.3 Insurance. The bank, at its expense, shall have the power to purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of the bank and on behalf of its directors and
officers against any liability asserted against such persons in their
capacities as directors and officers or arising out of their status as directors and officers, whether or not the bank would have the power to
indemnify the director or officer against such liability hereunder or under
the Minnesota Statutes. The bank's obligation to indemnify hereunder shall be
in excess of any insurance purchase and maintained by the bank, but such
insurance shall be the primary source of satisfaction of such obligation of
the bank. To the extent that indemnification is paid to or on behalf of a
director or officer by such insurance, such payments shall be deemed to be in
satisfaction of the bank's obligation to indemnify such director or officer.

5.4 Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The board of directors of the
bank by resolution may provide indemnification by the bank to any employee or
agent of the bank, other than directors and officers, to the extent provided
hereunder for directors and officers of the bank.





ARTICLE VI

Section 48.13 of the Minnesota Statutes.

AMENDMENTS



These bylaws may be amended by the shareholder(s) at an annual meeting of the
shareholder(s) or a special meeting of the shareholder(s) to be called for
such purpose.

sufficient severity to prevent the conduct and management of the affairs and
business of this bank by its directors and officers as contemplated by these
bylaws, any two (2) or more available directors shall constitute a quorum of
the board of directors and shall be empowered to accomplish the full conduct
and management of the affairs and business of this bank in accordance with
these bylaws. This particular bylaw shall be subject to further implementation
by resolutions adopted by a majority vote of all the directors from time to time, and any provisions of these
bylaws (other than this section) and any resolutions of the directors contrary
to the provisions of this section or to the provisions of any such
implementary resolutions shall be suspended until it shall be determined by
any interim segment of the board of directors acting under this section that
it shall be the advantage of this bank to resume the conduct and management of
its affairs and business under all of the other provisions of these bylaws.





ARTICLE IX
