however, that Cooper may, without the consent of Eaton, adjourn or postpone
the Court Meeting or EGM (i) in the case of adjournment, if requested by
Cooper Shareholders to do so, (ii) to the extent reasonably necessary to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement
or Form S-4 is provided to the Cooper Shareholders or to permit dissemination
of information which is material to shareholders voting at the Court Meeting
or the EGM, but only for so long as the Cooper Board determines in good faith,
after having consulted with outside counsel, that such action is reasonably
necessary or advisable to give the Cooper Shareholders sufficient time to
evaluate any such disclosure or information so provided or disseminated, or
(iii) if as of the time the Court Meeting or EGM is scheduled (as set forth
in the Joint Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Cooper Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) (A) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Court Meeting or the EGM, but only
until a meeting can be held at which there are a sufficient number of Cooper
Shares represented to constitute a quorum or (B) voting for the approval of
the Court Resolutions or the EGM Resolutions, as applicable, but only until a
meeting can be held at which there are a sufficient number of votes of
holders of Cooper Shares to approve the Court Meeting Resolutions or the EGM
Resolutions, as applicable; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | amend the Resolutions (in each case, in the form set out in
the Scheme Document); 
---|---|--- 
 



23  after despatch of the Scheme Document without the consent of Eaton (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



     | 3.6 | Switching to a Takeover Offer 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | In the event (and only in the event) that Eaton reasonably
considers (in its good faith discretion) that a competitive situation exists
or, based on facts known at the time, may reasonably be expected to arise in
connection with the Acquisition, Eaton may elect (and with the Panels
consent, if required) to implement the Acquisition by way of the Takeover
Offer (rather than the Scheme), whether or not the Scheme Document has been
posted, subject to the terms of this Clause 3.6. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Save where there has been a Cooper Change of Recommendation,
if Eaton elects to implement the Acquisition by way of the Takeover Offer,
Cooper undertakes to provide Eaton as promptly as reasonably practicable with
all such information about the Cooper Group (including directors and their
connected persons) as may reasonably be required for inclusion in the Takeover
Offer Document and to provide all such other assistance as may reasonably be
required by the Takeover Rules in connection with the preparation of the
Takeover Offer Document, including reasonable access to, and ensuring the
provision of reasonable assistance by, its management and
relevant professional advisers. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | If Eaton elects to implement the Acquisition by way of a
Takeover Offer, Cooper agrees: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | that the Takeover Offer Document will contain provisions in
accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Rule 2.5 Announcement,
the relevant Conditions and such other further terms and conditions as agreed
(including any modification thereto) between Eaton and Cooper; provided,
however, that the terms and conditions of the Takeover Offer shall be at least
as favourable to the Cooper Shareholders (except for the 80 per cent
acceptance condition contemplated by Paragraph 9 of Annex I to the Rule 2.5
Announcement) and the holders of Cooper Options and Cooper Share Awards and
Cooper Employees as those which would apply in relation to the Scheme; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | save where there has been a Cooper Change of
Recommendation, to reasonably co-operate and consult with Eaton in the
preparation of the Takeover Offer Document or any other document or filing
which is required for the purposes of implementing the Acquisition; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | that, subject to the obligations of the Cooper Board under
the Takeover Rules, and unless the Cooper Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors that,
to do otherwise, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the directors of Cooper or the Takeover Rules, with
respect to the Takeover Offer shall incorporate a recommendation to the
holders of the Cooper Shares from the Cooper Board to accept the Takeover
Offer, and such recommendation will not be withdrawn, adversely modified or
qualified except as contemplated by Clause 5.3. 
---|---|--- 
 



24 Recommendation, if Eaton elects to implement the Acquisition by way of the
Takeover Offer in accordance with Clause 3.6(a), the Parties mutually agree: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | to prepare and file with, or submit to, the SEC all
documents, amendments and supplements required to be filed therewith or
submitted thereto pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act in
connection with the Takeover Offer, and each Party shall have reasonable
opportunities to review and make comments on all such documents, amendments
and supplements and, following accommodation of such comments and approval of
such documents, amendments and supplements by the other Party, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, file or submit, as the case
may be, such documents, amendments and supplements with or to the SEC;  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | to provide the other Party with any comments received from
the SEC on any documents filed by it with the SEC promptly after receipt
thereof; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | to provide the other Party with reasonable prior notice of
any proposed oral communication with the SEC and afford the other Party
reasonable opportunity to participate therein. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | If the Takeover Offer is consummated, Eaton shall cause
Holdco to effect as promptly as reasonably practicable a compulsory
acquisition of any Cooper Shares under section 204 of the Act not acquired in
the Takeover Offer for the same consideration per share. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Clause 3.6 shall
require Cooper to provide Eaton with any information with respect to, or to
otherwise take or fail to take any action in connection with Coopers
consideration of or response to, any actual or potential Cooper Alternative
Proposal. 
---|---|--- 



     | 3.7 | Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Form S-4; Eaton

---|---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, each of the
Parties shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the SEC

Document, which shall also constitute the proxy statement relating to the
matters to be submitted to the Cooper Shareholders at the Court Meeting and
the EGM and (B) the proxy statement relating to the matters to be submitted
to the Eaton Shareholders at the Eaton Shareholders Meeting (such joint proxy
statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Joint
Proxy Statement") and (ii) a registration statement on Form S-4 (of which the
Joint Proxy Statement will form a part) with respect to the issuance of Holdco
Shares in respect of the Scheme and Merger (the "Form S-4"). Each of the
Parties shall use all reasonable endeavours to have the Joint Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 to be declared effective by the SEC, to
keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Acquisition and the Merger, and to mail the Joint Proxy Statement to their
respective shareholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective, to the extent required by applicable Law.  

---|---|--- 
 



25 receipt thereof, provide the other with copies of any written comments and
advise the other Party of any oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each Party shall cooperate
and provide the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC, and each Party will provide the
other Party with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Each Party
shall use all reasonable endeavours to take any action required to be taken by
it under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
Acquisition or the Merger, and each Party shall furnish all information
concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action. Each Party will advise the
other Party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension
of the qualification of the Holdco Shares issuable in connection with
the Acquisition and the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or
any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form
S-4. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
any of the Parties, or their respective Affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by either Party, and such information should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 so
that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party
and, to the extent required by Law an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the Cooper Shareholders and the Eaton
Shareholders. 
---|--- 



     | (b) |

Eaton shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of the Eaton Shareholders (the "Eaton Shareholders Meeting")
as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
effective for the purpose of obtaining the adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of Eaton Shares as required by Article SIXTH of the Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation of Eaton (the "Eaton Shareholder
Approval"). Save as required by Law, Eaton shall not adjourn or postpone the
Eaton Shareholders Meeting after filing of the Form S-4 without the consent of
Cooper (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, however, that Eaton may, without the consent of Cooper,
adjourn or postpone the Eaton Shareholders Meeting (i) to the extent
reasonably necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to
the Joint Proxy Statement or Form-S-4 is provided to the Eaton Shareholders or
to permit dissemination of information which is material to shareholders
voting at the Eaton Shareholder Meeting, but only for so long as the Eaton
Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with outside counsel,
that such action is reasonably necessary or advisable to give the Eaton
Shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any such disclosure or information
so provided or disseminated, or (ii) if as of the time the Eaton Shareholders
Meeting is scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement), there are
insufficient Eaton Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) (A) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of

votes of holders of Eaton Shares to obtain the Eaton Shareholder Approval.
Subject to Clause 5.4, Eaton shall (i) use all reasonable endeavours to
obtain from the Eaton Shareholders the Eaton Shareholder Approval and (ii)
through the Eaton Board, make the Eaton Recommendation to the Eaton
Shareholders and include the Eaton Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
Clause 9, this Agreement shall be submitted to the Eaton Shareholders at the
Eaton Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Eaton Shareholder
Approval, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Eaton of
such obligation. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | Eaton shall, prior to the Eaton Shareholders Meeting, keep
Cooper reasonably informed in the two (2) weeks prior to the Eaton
Shareholders Meeting of the number of proxy votes received in respect of
matters to be acted upon at the Eaton Shareholders Meeting, and in any event
shall provide such number promptly upon the request of Cooper or its
Representatives. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | Each of the Parties shall use all reasonable endeavours to

prior to the Effective Time and shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the
Effective Time and pursuant to the Scheme and without any action on the part
of the holder of such Cooper Option, be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive from Holdco the Scheme Consideration for each Net Cooper Share
subject to such Cooper Option, less the Applicable Withholding Amount, within
7 calendar days following the Effective Date. The Applicable Withholding
Amount covered under this Clause 4.1 shall first be applied to reduce the
aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such
holders Cooper Option and, to the extent such Applicable Withholding Amount
exceeds the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the
cancellation of such holders Cooper Option, the excess of such Applicable
Withholding Amount over the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of
the cancellation of such holders Cooper Option shall be applied to reduce the
aggregate Share Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such
holders Cooper Option (based on the Eaton Closing Price).

exercisable and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall, by
virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and pursuant to the Scheme and
without any action on the part of the holder of such Cooper Option, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product of (a) the total number of Cooper Shares subject to such Cooper
Option multiplied by (b) the excess, if any, of the Cash Out Amount over
the exercise price per Cooper Share subject to such Cooper Option. Holdco
shall pay to the holders of Cooper Options covered by this Clause 4.2, with

Consideration, less the Applicable Withholding Amount, within 7 calendar days
following the Effective Date.

immediately prior to the Effective Time (extrapolated through the end of the
performance period); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | with respect to any such Cooper Share Award granted under
the Cooper Industries plc Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan, the
target number of Cooper Shares subject to such Cooper Share Award. 
---|---|--- 

The Applicable Withholding Amount covered under this Clause 4.3 shall
first be applied to reduce the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in
respect of the cancellation of a holders Cooper Share Award and, to the
extent such Applicable Withholding Amount exceeds the aggregate Cash
Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holders Cooper
Share Award, the excess of such Applicable Withholding Amount over the
aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such
holders Cooper Share Award shall be applied to reduce the aggregate Share
Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holders Cooper
Share Award (based on the Eaton Closing Price).

Share Award, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Cooper Shares subject to

Withholding Amount, within 7 calendar days following the Effective Date.

 



     | 4.5 | Dividend Equivalents in Respect of Cooper Share Awards 
---|---|--- 

Where holders of Cooper Share Awards are entitled to dividend equivalents
under the Cooper Share Plans or any applicable award agreement, Holdco shall

will be made (a) in cash, with respect to dividend equivalents denominated in
cash and (b) in the form of consideration (cash or Scheme Consideration) which
mirrors the treatment of Cooper Share Awards under the applicable plan
pursuant to which such dividend equivalents were issued as set forth in
Clauses 4.1-4.4 hereof, with respect to dividend equivalents denominated in
Cooper Shares.

Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Eaton Board (or,
if appropriate, any committee administering Eatons stock-based incentive
plans) and Holdco shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as

be amended so that any Cooper Shares allotted following the EGM will either be
subject to the terms of the Scheme or acquired by Holdco for the same
consideration per Cooper Share as shall be payable to Cooper Shareholders
under the Scheme (depending upon the timing of such allotment); provided,
however that nothing in such amendment to the Articles of Association shall
prohibit the sale (whether on a stock exchange or otherwise) of any Cooper
Shares issued on the exercise of Cooper Options or vesting or settlement of
Cooper Share Awards, as applicable, following the EGM but prior to the
sanction of the Scheme by the High Court, it being always acknowledged that

36 ---|---|--- 



     | (a) | Subject to any actions which Cooper is required to take so
as to comply with the requirements of the Takeover Rules, Cooper agrees that
neither it nor any Subsidiary of Cooper shall, and that it shall use all
reasonable endeavours to cause its and their respective Representatives and
any person Acting in Concert with Cooper not to, directly or indirectly: (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any enquiry with respect to, or the
making or submission of, any Cooper Alternative Proposal, (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding a Cooper Alternative Proposal with,
or furnish any nonpublic information regarding a Cooper Alternative Proposal

existence of the provisions of this Clause 5.3, or (iii) waive, terminate,
modify or fail to use reasonable endeavours to enforce any provision of any
"standstill" or similar obligation of any person with respect to Cooper or any
of its Subsidiaries or, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, amend

Shareholders thereunder so as to facilitate the making of a Cooper Alternative
Proposal ( _provided_ that Cooper shall not be required to take, or be
prohibited from taking, any action otherwise prohibited or required by this
subclause (iii) if the Cooper Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with Coopers legal advisors) that such action or inaction would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law). Cooper shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Cooper Alternative Proposal, or any enquiry or
proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Cooper Alternative
Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished in connection therewith and immediately
terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to
any such person or its Representatives. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Clause 5.3(a), if Cooper receives
a _bona fide_ written Cooper Alternative Proposal or enquiry or proposal from
a person who is intending on making a Cooper Alternative Proposal and the
Cooper Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Coopers
financial advisors and legal counsel) that the failure to take the actions
described in clauses (x) and (y) below would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
which Cooper Alternative Proposal, enquiry or proposal was made after the date
of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a knowing or intentional
breach of this Clause 5.3, Cooper may take any or all of the following
actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party (and any persons
working in concert with such third party and to their respective potential
financing sources and Representatives) making or intending to make such Cooper
Alternative Proposal ( _provided_ that all such information has previously
been provided to Eaton or is provided to Eaton substantially concurrently
with the time it is provided to such person(s)), if, and only if, prior to so
furnishing such information, Cooper receives from the third party an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive of such person, with
respect to confidentiality, than the Confidentiality Agreement 

---|---|--- 
 



37 party (and such other persons) with respect to such Cooper Alternative
Proposal. Cooper will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of receipt)
notify Eaton orally and in writing of the receipt of any Cooper Alternative
Proposal or any communication or proposal that may reasonably be expected to
lead to a Cooper Alternative Proposal and shall, in the case of any
such notice to Eaton as to receipt of a Cooper Alternative Proposal, indicate
the material terms and conditions of such Cooper Alternative Proposal
(including any changes to such material terms and conditions) and the identity
of the person making any such Cooper Alternative Proposal and thereafter
shall promptly keep Eaton reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of
any material change to the terms and status of any such Cooper Alternative
Proposal. Cooper shall provide to Eaton as soon as reasonably practicable
after receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event within 48 hours of receipt
or delivery) copies of all written correspondence and other written material
exchanged between Cooper or any of its Subsidiaries and the person making a
Cooper Alternative Proposal (or such persons Representatives) that describes
any of the material terms or conditions of such Cooper Alternative Proposal,
including draft agreements or term sheets submitted in connection
therewith. Cooper shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter
into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the date of
this Agreement that prohibits Cooper from providing such information to Eaton. 
---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Except as set forth in Clauses 5.3(d), (e) and (f) below,
neither the Cooper Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or
modify in any manner adverse to Eaton), or propose publicly to withdraw (or
modify in any manner adverse to Eaton), the Scheme Recommendation or (B)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Cooper Alternative Proposal (any action
in this subclause (i) being referred to as a "Cooper Change of
Recommendation") (it being agreed that (x) no "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act in and of itself
shall constitute a Cooper Change of Recommendation and (y) for the avoidance
of doubt, the provision by Cooper to Eaton of notice or information in
connection with a Cooper Alternative Proposal or Cooper Superior Proposal as
required or expressly permitted by this Agreement shall not, in and of itself,
constitute a Cooper Change of Recommendation) or (ii) cause or allow Cooper or
any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, transaction agreement, implementation agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement
or other agreement constituting or with respect to, or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Cooper Alternative Proposal, or requiring, or
reasonably expected to cause, Cooper to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to
consummate the Acquisition (other than as contemplated by Clause 5.3(i)(i)
and other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Clause 5.3(b)). 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Cooper Board, at any
time prior to obtaining the Cooper Shareholder Approval, from making a Cooper
Change of Recommendation if the Cooper Board has concluded in good faith
(after consultation with Coopers outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) (i) that a Cooper Alternative Proposal constitutes a Cooper  

---|---|--- 
 



38 Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that
Cooper shall have provided prior written notice to Eaton, at least 24 hours in
advance, of the Cooper Boards intention to make such Cooper Change of
Recommendation. 
---|--- 
 



     | (e) | Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the
Cooper Board, in response to an Intervening Event, from making a Cooper Change
of Recommendation at any time prior to obtaining the Cooper Shareholder
Approval if the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding any Cooper
Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with Clause 9, Cooper shall hold the Court Meeting and the EGM in
accordance with Clause 3.1 for purposes of obtaining the approval of the
Resolutions by the requisite majorities of Cooper Shareholders, and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Cooper of such
obligation. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit or
restrict Cooper or the Cooper Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the
Cooper Shareholders a position or making a statement contemplated by Rule
14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Cooper Shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Cooper Board (after
consultation with Coopers outside legal advisors), failure to so disclose
and/or take would be reasonably likely to give rise to a violation of
applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that any disclosure of a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
that relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by
the Cooper Board with respect to this Agreement or a Cooper
Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be a Cooper Change of Recommendation
unless Cooper in connection with such disclosure publicly states that the
Cooper Board expressly rejects the applicable Cooper Alternative Proposal,
expressly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement has
not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the Cooper Board, without
disclosing any Change in Recommendation. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) |

As used in this Agreement, "Cooper Alternative Proposal" shall mean any _bona
fide_ proposal or _bona fide_ offer made by any person (other than a proposal
or offer by Eaton or any of its Associates or any person Acting in Concert
with Eaton pursuant to Rule 2.5 of the Takeover Rules) for (i) the acquisition
of Cooper by scheme of arrangement, takeover offer or business combination
transaction; (ii) the acquisition by any person of 25% or more of the assets
of Cooper and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, measured by either book
value or fair market value (including equity securities of
Coopers Subsidiaries); (iii) the acquisition by any person (or the
stockholders of any person) of 25% or more of the outstanding Cooper Shares;
or (iv) any merger, business combination, consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalisation or similar transaction involving Cooper as a result of which
the holders of Cooper Shares immediately prior to such transaction do not, in
the aggregate, own at least 75% of the outstanding voting power of the
surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after 

---|---|--- 
 



39 of the type described in Clause 5.3(g) of the Cooper Disclosure Schedule. 
---|--- 
 



     | (h) | As used in this Agreement "Cooper Superior Proposal" shall
mean a written _bona fide_ Cooper Alternative Proposal made by any person that
the Cooper Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Coopers
financial advisors and legal counsel) is more favourable to the Cooper
Shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into
account such financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal
as the Cooper Board considers to be appropriate (it being understood that, for
purposes of the definition of "Cooper Superior Proposal", references to "25%"
and "75%" in the definition of Cooper Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to
refer to "50%"). 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | The Parties agree that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

Cooper may terminate this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Cooper
Shareholder Approval, in order to enter into any agreement, understanding or
arrangement providing for a Cooper Superior Proposal, provided that (x)
promptly upon the Cooper Boards determination that a Cooper Superior Proposal
exists (and in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours of
such determination) Cooper has provided a written notice to Eaton (a
"Superior Proposal Notice") advising Eaton that Cooper has received a Cooper
Alternative Proposal and specifying the information with respect thereto
required by Clause 5.3(b) and including written notice of the determination
of the Cooper Board that the Cooper Alternative Proposal constitutes a Cooper
Superior Proposal, (y) Cooper has provided Eaton with an opportunity, for a
period of 72 hours from the time of delivery to Eaton of the Superior
Proposal Notice (as may be extended pursuant to the proviso below, the "Notice
Period"), to propose to amend (the "Right to Match") the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the Acquisition, including an increase in, or
modification of, the Scheme Consideration (any such proposed transaction, a
"Revised Acquisition"), such that the Cooper Superior Proposal no longer
constitutes a Cooper Superior Proposal (provided, that if Eaton delivers to
Cooper, within 48 hours of the time of delivery to Eaton of the Superior
Proposal Notice, a written notice (a "Financing Extension Notice") stating
that Eaton intends to propose such a Revised Acquisition and that Eaton
intends to seek an increase of the amount of the Financing due to an increase
in the Cash Consideration, the end of the Notice Period shall be extended
until 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the fourth Business Day after the date such
Financing Extension Notice is timely delivered), and (z) at the end of such
Notice Period, the Cooper Board has determined that the Cooper Superior
Proposal continues to be a Cooper Superior Proposal notwithstanding the
Revised Acquisition and taking into account all amendments and proposed
changes made thereto during the Notice Period. In the event that during the
Notice Period any material revision is made to the financial terms of the
Cooper Superior Proposal, Cooper shall be required, on one instance only, to
deliver a new Superior Proposal Notice to Eaton and to comply with the
requirements of this Clause 5.3(i)(i) with respect to such new Superior
Proposal Notice, except that the Notice Period (A) shall be 

---|---|--- 
 



40 the initial Notice Period and (B) shall not be subject to extension pursuant
to a Financing Extension Notice if Eaton has previously delivered a Financing
Extension Notice; and 
---|--- 



     | (ii) | in the event that a competitive situation arises pursuant
to Rule 31.4 of the Takeover Rules in relation to Eaton and a third party or
parties, Cooper shall use reasonable endeavours to obtain permission from the
Panel to provide that the auction procedure determined by the Panel shall give
effect to and be consistent with Eatons rights and the obligations of Cooper
and the Cooper Board pursuant to this Clause 5.3(i), and Cooper shall, to the
extent reasonably practicable, keep Eaton reasonably informed of any
discussions with the Panel in respect of the determination of such auction
procedure. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 5.4 | Eaton Change of Recommendation 
---|---|--- 

Subject to the next sentence, neither the Eaton Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Cooper), or
propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Cooper), the
Eaton Recommendation (any such action being referred to as an "Eaton Change of
Recommendation") (it being agreed that no "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act in and of itself
shall constitute an Eaton Change of Recommendation). Nothing in this Agreement
shall prohibit or restrict the Eaton Board, in response to an Intervening
Event, from making an Eaton Change of Recommendation at any time prior to
obtaining the Eaton Shareholder Approval if the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law. Notwithstanding any Eaton Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with Clause 9, Eaton shall hold the Eaton
Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Clause 3.7 for purposes of obtaining
the Eaton Shareholder Approval, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed
to relieve Eaton of such obligation.



   6. | REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     | 6.1 | Cooper Representations and Warranties 
---|---|--- 

Except as disclosed in the Cooper SEC Documents filed or furnished with the
SEC since January 1, 2010 and publicly available prior to the date hereof (but
excluding any forward looking disclosures set forth in any "risk factors"
section, any disclosures in any "forward looking statements" section and any
other disclosures included therein to the extent they are predictive or
forward-looking in nature) or in the applicable section of the disclosure
schedule delivered by Cooper to Eaton immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement (the "Cooper Disclosure Schedule") (it being agreed that
disclosure of any item in any section of the Cooper Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of this Agreement to
which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), Cooper represents
and warrants to Eaton as follows:

 



     | (a) |

_Qualification, Organisation, Subsidiaries, etc_. Each of Cooper and its
Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organised, validly existing and, where
relevant, in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of

business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organised,
validly existing, qualified or, where relevant, in good standing, or to have
such power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Cooper Material Adverse Effect. Cooper has
filed with the SEC, prior to the date of this Agreement, a complete and
accurate copy of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Cooper (the
"Cooper Memorandum and Articles of Association") as amended to the date
hereof. The Cooper Memorandum and Articles of Association are in full force

than Cooper Permitted Liens. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | _Tools Joint Venture_. Cooper Industries, LLC, a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Cooper, owns a 50% membership interest in Apex Tool Group,
LLC (the "Tools JV"). The equity interests of Tools JV owned by Cooper
Industries, LLC are owned free and clear of all Liens, other than Cooper
Permitted Liens and have not been issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights. All of the issued and outstanding membership interests in
Tools JV owned by Cooper Industries, LLC have been duly authorized and are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

     | (i) | The authorised capital of Cooper consists of 40,000 ordinary
shares, par value 1.00 per share ("Cooper Euro-Denominated
Shares"), 750,000,000 Cooper Shares and 10,000,000 preferred shares, par
value $0.01 per share ("Cooper Preferred Shares"). As of May 15, 2012 (the
"Capitalisation Date"), (A) (i) 159,166,699 Cooper Shares (together with the
preferred share purchase rights granted pursuant to the Cooper Rights
Agreement) were issued and outstanding and (ii) no Cooper Euro-Denominated
Shares were issued or outstanding, (B) (i) 14,325,562 Cooper Shares were held
in treasury and (ii) no Cooper Shares were held by Subsidiaries of Cooper, (C)

respective terms thereof, duly authorised, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and free of pre-emptive rights. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

Except as set forth in sub-clause (i) above, as of the date hereof: (A) Cooper
does not have any shares of capital in issue or outstanding other than Cooper
Shares that have become outstanding after the 

---|---|--- 
 



42 forth in sub-clause (i) above, and (B) there are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, puts, calls, exchangeable or convertible securities or
other similar rights, agreements or commitments relating to the issuance of
shares of capital to which Cooper or any of Coopers Subsidiaries is a party
obligating Cooper or any of Coopers Subsidiaries to (I) issue, transfer or
sell any shares in the capital or other equity interests of Cooper or any
Subsidiary of Cooper or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
shares or equity interests (in each case other than to Cooper or a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Cooper); (II) grant, extend or enter into any such
subscription, option, warrant, put, call, exchangeable or convertible
securities or other similar right, agreement or commitment; (III) redeem or
otherwise acquire any such shares in its capital or other equity interests;

Cooper or (E) which would not reasonably be expected to materially impair the

valid, binding and in full force and effect and (ii) no uncured default of a
material nature on the part of Cooper or, if applicable, its Subsidiary or, to

Cooper and each of its Subsidiaries has a good and valid leasehold interest,
subject to the terms of any lease, sublease or other agreement applicable
thereto, in each parcel of Cooper Leased Real Property, free and clear of all
Liens, except for Cooper Permitted Liens. As of the date hereof, neither

     | (ii) | Neither Cooper nor any Subsidiary of Cooper is in breach of
or default under the terms of any Cooper Material Contract where such breach
or default would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

the date hereof, no other party to any Cooper Material Contract is in breach
of or default under the terms of any Cooper Material Contract where such
breach or default would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Cooper Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Cooper Material Adverse
Effect, each Cooper Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of
Cooper or the Subsidiary of Cooper which is party thereto and, to the
knowledge of Cooper, of each other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, examinership, reorganisation, moratorium or other

material respects for companies of similar size in the same or similar lines
of business and (ii) all premiums due thereunder have been paid. Neither
Cooper nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of cancellation or
termination with respect to any material third party insurance policies or
contracts (other than in connection with normal renewals of any such insurance
policies or contracts) where such cancellation or termination would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Cooper
Material Adverse Effect. 
---|---|---

broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement who might be entitled to any fee or any commission in connection

other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Cooper or
any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided or
made available to Eaton in connection with the transactions contemplated by

continued use of the applicable property for the purposes for which the
property is currently being used (any such Lien described in any of sub-
clauses (A) through (E), a "Eaton Permitted Lien"). As of the date hereof,
neither Eaton nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any pending,
and to the knowledge of Eaton there is no threatened, condemnation proceeding

not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Eaton
Material Adverse Effect.

     | (q) | _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Eaton Board has
received the opinion of each of Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC and Citigroup Global
Markets Inc., dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of
such date, the Merger Consideration to be received by the Eaton Shareholders
pursuant to the Merger is fair to the Eaton Shareholders from a financial
point of view. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (r) | _Required Vote of Eaton Shareholders_. The Eaton

---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Except for this Agreement or any contracts filed as exhibits

Benefit Plans, being referred to herein as "Eaton Material Contracts"). 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

Neither Eaton nor any Subsidiary of Eaton is in breach of or default under the
terms of any Eaton Material Contract where such breach or default
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an
Eaton Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Eaton, as of the date
hereof, no other party to any Eaton Material Contract is in breach of or
default under the terms of any Eaton Material Contract where such breach or
default would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an Eaton Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Eaton Material Adverse
Effect, each Eaton Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of
Eaton or the Subsidiary of Eaton which is party thereto and, to the 

---|---|--- 
 



66 full force and effect, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, examinership, reorganisation, moratorium
or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors
rights generally and (ii) equitable remedies of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defences and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought. 
---|---

have, individually or in the aggregate, an Eaton Material Adverse Effect, as

contracts of Eaton and its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and are
valid and enforceable and cover against the risks as are customary in all
material respects for companies of similar size in the same or similar lines
of business and (ii) all premiums due thereunder have been paid. Neither Eaton
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of cancellation or termination

or contracts) where such cancellation or termination would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Eaton Material Adverse
Effect. 
---|---|--- 



     | (u) | _Finders or Brokers_. Except for Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC
and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., neither Eaton nor any of its Subsidiaries

or the Merger.  
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | _Financing_. At the date of the Effective Time, Holdco will

     | (w) | _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this Clause 6.2 or in any certificates delivered

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to Cooper or to Coopers Representatives in certain "data rooms" or
management presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

---|---|--- 



     | (a) |

Each of Cooper and Eaton shall afford the other Party and such other Partys

properties, employees, contracts, commitments, books and records, financial
and operating data, any report, schedule or other document filed or received
by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable Laws for purposes
of integration planning. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Cooper nor
Eaton shall be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt
the operations of such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a
violation of any agreement to which such Party or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, would cause a risk of a loss of privilege to such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law (provided
that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable endeavours to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such violation
or loss of privilege). If any material is withheld by a Party pursuant to the
preceding sentence, such Party shall (subject to the preceding sentence)
inform the other Party as to the general nature of what is being withheld. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | The Parties hereby agree that all information provided to
them or their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to

or reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Acquisition),

68 Parties shall make their respective filings under the HSR Act no later than 15
Business Days after the date hereof), (B) under the EC Merger Regulation, (C)
under any other Antitrust Laws or foreign investment Laws, (D) under the
Takeover Rules and the Act or (E) as required by the High Court; and

actions to obtain from, make with or provide to any third party any Clearances
required to be obtained, made or provided by Cooper or Eaton or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Acquisition); provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event shall Cooper or Eaton or any of their respective Subsidiaries be
required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any third party for any Clearance required in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Acquisition) under any contract or agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, including Clause
7.2(h), each of the Parties agrees, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use all reasonable endeavours to (i) obtain
any Clearances required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Acquisition) under the HSR
Act, the EC Merger Regulation and any other federal, state or foreign Law
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of monopolisation or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"), and
(ii) respond to any requests of any Relevant Authority for information or
documentary material under any Antitrust Law, and to contest and resist any

contrary contained in this Agreement, Eaton shall, on behalf of the Parties,
control and lead all communications and strategy relating to the Antitrust
Laws (provided that Cooper is not constrained from complying with applicable
Law). The Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider
in good faith the views of one another, regarding the form and content of any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to their
submission. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) |

Subject to the proviso in Clause 7.2(d), Eaton and Cooper shall (i) promptly
advise each other of (and Eaton or Cooper shall so advise with respect to
communications received by any Subsidiary of Eaton or Cooper, as the case may
be) any written or oral communication from any Relevant Authority or third
party whose Clearance is required or reasonably necessary in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Acquisition); (ii) not participate in any meeting or discussion
with any Relevant Authority in respect of any filing, investigation, or
enquiry  

---|---|--- 
 



69 this Agreement unless it consults with the other Party in advance, and, unless
prohibited by such Relevant Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity
to attend; and (iii) promptly furnish the other Party with copies of all
correspondence, filings, and written communications between them and their
Subsidiaries and Representatives, on the one hand, and any Relevant Authority
or its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that materials may be
redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
businesses of Cooper or Eaton or their respective Affiliates, (y) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. Eaton shall not
consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting
period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Relevant Authority without
considering in good faith the views of Cooper and Cooper shall not consent to
any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the behest of any Relevant Authority without the consent of
Eaton, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. With respect to any notice, documentation or other communication
required to be given by either Party to the other Party pursuant to this
Clause 7.2(e), such first Party may give such notice, documentation or other
communication to such second Partys outside counsel, instead of directly to
such second Party, if such first Party reasonably believes that doing so is

---|--- 



     | (f) | Each Party will provide as promptly as practicable such
information and documentary material as may be requested by a Relevant
Authority following any such filing or notification and shall negotiate with
any Relevant Authority in relation to any undertakings, orders, agreements or
commitments which any such Relevant Authority requires to facilitate the
Acquisition and the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) | In the event that the latest date on which the High Court
and/or the Panel would permit Completion to occur is prior to the date that is
one year after the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall use all
reasonable endeavours to obtain consent of the High Court and/or the Panel, as
applicable, to an extension of such latest date (but not beyond the date that
is one year after the date of this Agreement). If (i) the High Court and/or
the Panel require the lapsing of the Scheme prior to the date that is one year
after the date of this Agreement, (ii) the Scheme lapses pursuant to Rule
12(b)(i) of the Takeover Rules, (iii) Condition 1 fails to be satisfied or
(iv) the Scheme lapses pursuant to paragraph 7 of Annex I to the Rule 2.5
Announcement as a result of the Scheme failing to have become effective on or
prior to the date that is one year after the date of this Agreement,
the Parties shall (unless and until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Clause 9) take all actions required in order to re-initiate the Scheme process
as promptly as reasonably practicable (it being understood that no such
lapsing described in sub-clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) shall, in and of
itself, result in a termination of, or otherwise affect any rights or
obligations of any Party under, this Agreement). 
---|---|--- 
 



70 covenants contained in this Clause 7.2, Eaton and Cooper agree to take, or
cause to be taken (including by its Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to
make, or cause to be made (including by its Subsidiaries), any and all
undertakings necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that a Relevant
Authority may assert under any Antitrust Law with respect to the Acquisition
or the Merger, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Relevant Authority with respect to
the Acquisition or the Merger, in each case, so as to enable the Completion
to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than the End
Date, including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of Eaton or Cooper (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) or any
equity interest in any joint venture held by Eaton or Cooper (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries), (y) creating, terminating, or divesting
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Eaton or Cooper
or their respective Subsidiaries and (z) otherwise taking or committing to
take any action that would limit Eatons freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses,
assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Eaton or Cooper
(including any of their respective Subsidiaries) or any equity interest in
any joint venture held by Eaton or Cooper (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries), in each case as may be required in order to obtain all
Clearances required directly or indirectly under any Antitrust Law or to avoid
the commencement of any action to prohibit the Acquisition or the Merger
under any Antitrust Law, or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any action or proceeding seeking to prohibit the Acquisition or the Merger or
delay Completion beyond the End Date. To assist Eaton in complying with its
obligations set forth in this Clause 7.2, Cooper shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more agreements requested by Eaton to be
entered into by any of them prior to the Completion with respect to any
transaction to divest, hold separate or otherwise take any action that limits
Coopers or its Subsidiaries freedom of action, ownership or control
with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly,
any of the businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties
of Cooper or any of its Subsidiaries or any equity interest in any joint
venture held by Cooper or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Divestiture
Action"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the consummation of the transactions
provided for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action shall be
conditioned upon the Completion. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, nothing in this Clause 7.2 shall require, or be deemed to
require, Eaton or Cooper (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) to take any
action, agree to take any action or consent to the taking of any action
(including with respect to selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of
any business or assets or conducting its (or its Subsidiaries) or, following
consummation of the Acquisition and the Merger, Holdcos, business in any
specified manner) if doing so would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the business,
operations or financial condition of Holdco (following consummation of the
Acquisition and the Merger). 
---|---|--- 
 



71 ---|---|---

respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) shall survive
the consummation of the Scheme and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Holdco shall maintain in effect the provisions for indemnification,
advancement of expenses or exculpation in the Organisational Documents of
Cooper and its Subsidiaries or in any agreement to which Cooper or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were directors,
officers or employees of Cooper or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time arising out
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event any claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation is
pending, asserted or made either prior to the Effective Time or within such
six year period, all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or
exculpation required to be continued pursuant to this Clause 7.3(a) in
respect thereof shall continue until disposition thereof. From and after the
Effective Time, Holdco shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and
honour and guaranty, and shall cause Cooper and its Subsidiaries to honour, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this Clause 7.3 without limit as to time.

     | (b) |

Holdco agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or
exculpation (including all limitations on personal liability) existing as of
the date of this Agreement in favour of each present and former director,
officer or employee of Eaton or any of its Subsidiaries provided for in their
respective Organisational Documents or in any agreement to which Eaton or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party in respect of actions or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including actions or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time arising out of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) shall survive the consummation of the Scheme and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period
of six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time, Holdco shall maintain in
effect the provisions for indemnification, advancement of expenses or
exculpation in the Organisational Documents of Eaton and its Subsidiaries or
in any agreement to which Eaton or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and
shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at
any time prior to the Merger Effective Time were directors, officers or
employees of Eaton or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of actions
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time (including
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time
arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in  

---|---|--- 
 



72 investigation is pending, asserted or made either prior to the Merger
Effective Time or within such six year period, all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses or exculpation required to be continued pursuant to
this Clause 7.3(b) in respect thereof shall continue until disposition
thereof. From and after the Effective Time, Holdco shall assume, be jointly

shall cause to be maintained in effect (i) the coverage provided by the
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance in effect as of the Completion Date maintained by Cooper
and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time (provided that Holdco may substitute therefor policies with a
carrier with comparable credit ratings to the existing carrier of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
favourable to the insured) or (ii) a "tail" policy (which Cooper may purchase
at its option prior to the Effective Time, and, in such case, Holdco shall
cause such policy to be in full force and effect, and shall cause all
obligations thereunder to be honoured by Cooper) under Coopers
existing directors and officers insurance policy that covers those persons
who are currently covered by Coopers directors and officers insurance
policy in effect as of the date hereof for actions and omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, is from a carrier with comparable credit
ratings to Coopers existing directors and officers insurance policy carrier
and contains terms and conditions that are no less favourable to the insured
than those of Coopers directors and officers insurance policy in effect as
of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Effective Time,
Holdco shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of
the last annual premium paid by Cooper prior to the date hereof in respect of
the coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) |

For a period of six years from the Merger Effective Time, Holdco shall cause
to be maintained in effect (i) the coverage provided by the policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance

     | (g) | The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Clause 7.3
shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such
Indemnified Party may have under the Organisational Documents of Cooper or
any of its Subsidiaries or the Organisational Documents of Eaton or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, any agreement, any insurance policy, the Act (or
any other applicable Law) or otherwise. The provisions of this Clause 7.3
shall survive the consummation of the Acquisition and the Merger and shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Person without the written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties
shall be third party beneficiaries of this Clause 7.3 and shall be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained in this Clause 7.3). Holdco shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided
for in this Clause 7.3.

     | (h) | In the event Holdco or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys more than 50% of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Holdco
assume the obligations set forth in this Clause 7.3. 
---|---|--- 



     | 7.4 | Employment and Benefit Matters 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) |

For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Holdco shall provide,
or shall cause to be provided, to each Cooper Employee (i) base compensation
and target annual cash bonus (as a percentage of base compensation) that, in
each case, is no less favourable than was provided to such Cooper Employee
immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) other
compensation opportunities and benefits (excluding severance benefits) that
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, either (A) to those generally
made available to similarly situated Eaton employees under Holdcos and
Eatons compensation and benefit plans and programs, or (B) to those provided
to such Cooper Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, as determined
by Holdco in its reasonable discretion. Further, and notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Holdco shall provide any Cooper
Employee whose employment terminates during the one-year period following the
Effective Time with severance benefits that are no less favourable than the
severance benefits to which such Cooper Employee would have been entitled
under the applicable Cooper Benefit Plan as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and during such one-year period following the Effective Time
severance benefits shall be determined without taking into account any
reductions after the Effective Time in base compensation or target annual cash
bonus (as a percentage of base compensation). Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Holdco shall observe the provisions and
obligations of any extant collective 

---|---|--- 
 



75 that govern the employment of any Cooper Employees. 
---|--- 
 



     | (b) | For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and
level of benefits under the employee benefit plans of Holdco and Eaton
providing benefits to any Cooper Employees after the Effective Time (the "New
Plans"), each Cooper Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Cooper Group and its predecessors before the Effective Time,
to the same extent as such Cooper Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Cooper Benefit Plan in
which such Cooper Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_  that the foregoing shall
not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each Cooper Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing
comparable coverage under a Cooper Benefit Plan in which such Cooper Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the "Old Plans"), and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Cooper Employee, Holdco
shall use reasonable endeavours to cause (1) all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents (but, with respect to Eatons
long-term disability plans, only to the extent such pre-existing conditions
are waived for Eaton employees), unless and to the extent the individual,
immediately prior to entry in the New Plans, was subject to such conditions
under the comparable Old Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, as of the
Effective Time, a Cooper Employee is on long-term disability under a Cooper
long-term disability plan and the Eaton long-term disability plan would not
cover such long-term disability, Holdco and Eaton shall maintain the Cooper
long-term disability plan with respect to such individual, and (2) any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Holdco and Eaton hereby acknowledges that a "change of
control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of those Cooper Benefit Plans
set forth in Section 7.4(c) of the Cooper Disclosure Schedule will occur at
or prior to the Effective Time, as applicable. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Eaton will cooperate with Cooper in respect of consultation
obligations and similar notice and bargaining obligations owed to any
employees or consultants of Cooper or any Subsidiary of Cooper in accordance
with all applicable Laws and bargaining agreements, if any. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Without limiting the provisions of Section 7.4(a) hereof: 
---|---|--- 
 



76 December 31, 2012, Cooper shall have the right to pay, on or after January 1,
2013 and prior to the Effective Time, to each employee of the Cooper Group
who participates in an annual bonus or incentive plan in respect of calendar
year 2012 (each, a "2012 Bonus Plan Participant"), an annual cash bonus in
respect of fiscal year 2012 (collectively the "2012 Bonuses") based on actual
performance (subject to reduction based on the recommendation of the Chief
Executive Officer of Cooper as of the date of this Agreement or his designee). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | In the event that the Effective Time occurs prior to such
time as Cooper has paid 2012 Bonuses, Holdco shall pay, on or prior to March
15, 2013, the 2012 Bonuses based on actual performance as of December 31,
2012 (or, if not practicable, based on actual performance as of the Effective
Time extrapolated through December 31, 2012) to each 2012 Bonus Plan
Participant who is employed by the Cooper Group on the earlier of December
31, 2012 and the Effective Time and whose employment has not been terminated
for cause prior to the payment date. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | As of the Effective Time, Eaton hereby expressly assumes the
MCAs set forth in Section 6.1(i)(v) of the Cooper Disclosure Schedule. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) | Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Cooper
Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of Eaton or any
Affiliate of Eaton, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights
of Eaton or any affiliate of Eaton, which rights are hereby expressly
reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Cooper Employee at any
time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Clause 7.4 shall
(x) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any
Cooper Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Eaton, or (y) create any
third party rights in any current or former service provider of Eaton, Cooper
or any of their respective affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 7.5 | Stock Exchange Listing 
---|---|--- 
 

Holdco and Eaton shall use all reasonable endeavours to cause (i) the Holdco
Shares to be delivered pursuant to the Merger and (ii) all of the Share

the NYSE, subject only to official notice of issuance, prior to the Completion

that comprise the full Holdco Board shall be twelve, and such board of

this Agreement, to be selected by the Governance Committee of the Eaton Board
pursuant to the director nomination process set forth in Eatons proxy

that, prior to the Effective Time, any designee of Cooper to the Holdco Board
is

 



77  unable to serve on such board of directors, a replacement shall be similarly
selected by the Governance Committee of the Eaton Board from the existing
members of the Cooper Board as designated by Cooper.



     | 7.7 | Rule 16b-3 Actions 
---|---|--- 
 

Prior to the Effective Time, Holdco, Cooper and Eaton shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause (a) any dispositions of Cooper Shares or
Eaton Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Cooper Shares or

the Effective Time, Holdco shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Cooper Share, entitled at the Effective Time to a right
to receive the Scheme Consideration pursuant to Clause 8.1(c)(i), (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that
risk of loss and title to the Cooper Shares shall pass, only upon adherence to
the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal), and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Cooper Shares in exchange for
payment of the Scheme Consideration therefor. Upon surrender of Cooper Shares,
which at the Effective Time were cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the Scheme Consideration, to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Cooper Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (a) a check in an amount of U.S.
dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Clause
8.1(d)(v)) equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration payable to such holder in
respect thereof pursuant to Clause 8.1(c)(i)(A) and the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of any Fractional Entitlements that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Clause 8.1(c)(i)(B) and (b) that number of Holdco
Shares into which such holders properly surrendered Cooper Shares were
converted pursuant to Clause 8.2(c)(i)(B). No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue for the benefit of holders of the Cooper Shares on the Scheme
Consideration payable in respect of the Cooper Shares. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | _Termination of Cooper Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Cooper Exchange Fund which has not been transferred to the holders of Cooper
Shares as of the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Holdco or its designee, upon demand, and the Holdco Shares
included therein shall be sold at the best price reasonably obtainable at the
time. Any holder of Cooper Shares who has not complied with this Clause
8.1(d) prior to the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time shall
thereafter look only to Holdco for payment of such holders claim for the
Scheme Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar applicable Laws). 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | _No Liability_. None of the Eaton Merger Parties, Eaton or
Cooper or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any person in respect of
any Scheme Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
from the Cooper Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) |

_Withholding_. Holdco and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this  

---|---|--- 
 



83 subject to the Scheme such amounts as Holdco or the Exchange Agent may be
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Holdco or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid. 
---|--- 



     | 8.2 | Merger 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | _Completion of Merger_. The Merger shall be conditioned
only upon the concurrent consummation and implementation of the Scheme and the
Acquisition. On Completion, and in accordance with the OGCL, MergerSub shall
be merged with and into Eaton at the Merger Effective Time (as defined in
Clause 8.2(b)). Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
MergerSub shall cease and Eaton shall continue as the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation"). As a result of the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation shall become a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of EHC and an
indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | _Merger Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of
the OGCL shall be duly executed by Eaton and MergerSub and as soon as
practicable following the Completion shall be filed on the Completion Date
with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio (the "Certificate of
Merger"). The Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio or at
such later time as may be designated jointly by Eaton and Cooper and specified
in such Certificate of Merger; provided that the Merger shall become
effective substantially concurrently with the effectiveness of the Scheme, to
the extent possible (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "Merger
Effective Time"). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Merger Effective
Time, the Merger will have the effects set forth in the Certificate of Merger
and the OGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Merger Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
MergerSub shall cease and all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Eaton and MergerSub shall be vested in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Eaton and MergerSub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | _Governing Documents_. The Articles of Incorporation and
Regulations of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended as of the Merger
Effective Time so as to read in their entirety as the Articles of
Incorporation and Regulations of MergerSub as in effect immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time, except for the incorporator and except that the
Surviving Corporation shall retain Eatons name.  
---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

_Officers and Directors_. From and after the Merger Effective Time, the
officers of Eaton immediately before the Merger Effective Time shall be the 

---|---|--- 
 



84 Merger Effective Time. 
---|--- 



     | (f) | _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Merger Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any
of their respective shareholders: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | _Conversion of Eaton Common Stock_. Each Eaton Share issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, and all rights
in respect thereof, shall be cancelled and automatically converted into and
become the right to receive one Holdco Share (the "Merger Consideration") from
EHC or MergerSub, as applicable. As a result of the Merger, at the Merger
Effective Time, each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time represented outstanding Eaton
Shares (the "Eaton Certificates") and each holder of record of a non-
certificated outstanding Eaton Share represented by book entry ("Eaton Book
Entry Shares") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the consideration payable in respect of the Eaton Shares
represented by such Eaton Certificate or Eaton Book Entry Share (as
applicable) immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time to be issued in
accordance with Clause 8.2(g). 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | _MergerSub Capital Stock_. At the Merger Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or
any of their respective shareholders, each share of common stock of MergerSub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, and all
rights in respect thereof, shall forthwith be cancelled and cease to exist and
be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and which shall be held by EHC. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | _Cancellation of Holdco Shares_. Each Holdco Subscriber
Share in existence immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall
immediately following the Effective Time be acquired by Holdco for nil
consideration under the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | _Eaton-Owned Shares_. Each Eaton Share held by Eaton as
treasury stock or owned by Eaton immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time, shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof, and no consideration
shall be paid with respect thereto. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | _Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | _Exchange Agent_. At the Merger Effective Time, EHC and
MergerSub shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, certificates or, at Holdcos
option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing all of the Holdco
Shares in issue immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than the
Holdco Subscriber Shares). All certificates representing Holdco Shares
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
hereinafter be referred to as the "Eaton Exchange Fund". 
---|---|--- 
 



85 practicable after the Merger Effective Time, and in any event within four (4)
Business Days after the Merger Effective Time, Holdco shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of an Eaton Certificate and to
each holder of record of an Eaton Book Entry Share, which at the Merger
Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Clause 8.2(f)(i), (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title
to the Eaton Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Eaton Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Eaton Book Entry
Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Eaton Certificates and Eaton Book Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender of Eaton
Certificates or Eaton Book Entry Shares (as applicable) for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Eaton Certificates or Eaton Book Entry Shares (as applicable)
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (a) that number of Holdco
Shares into which such holders Eaton Shares represented by such holders
properly surrendered Eaton Certificates or Eaton Book Entry Shares
(as applicable) were converted pursuant to Clause 8.2(f)(i), and the Eaton
Certificates or Eaton Book Entry Shares (as applicable) so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled, and (b) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after
giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Clause 8.2(g)(ix))
equal to any cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Clause 8.2(g)(iv). No interest shall be paid or
shall accrue for the benefit of holders of the Eaton Certificates or Eaton
Book Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Eaton
Certificates or Eaton Book Entry Shares. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

_Transferred Certificates; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If payment
or issuance of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the surrendered Eaton Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment or issuance that the Eaton Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment or issuance shall
have paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer and other taxes required by
reason of the payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration to a person
other than the registered holder of the Eaton Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax
either has been paid or is not applicable. In the event that any Eaton
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders
compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Exchange
Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to the Eaton Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in
exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Eaton 

---|---|--- 
 



86 respect of the Eaton Shares represented by the Eaton Certificate pursuant to
this Clause 8.2. 
---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Holdco Shares with a record
date after the Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Eaton Certificate or Eaton Book Entry Shares (as applicable)
with respect to the Eaton Shares represented thereby until such Eaton
Certificate or Eaton Book Entry Shares (as applicable) has been surrendered
in accordance with this Clause 8.2. Subject to applicable Law and the
provisions of this Clause 8.2, following surrender of any such Eaton
Certificate or Eaton Book Entry Shares (as applicable), there shall be paid to
the record holder thereof by the Exchange Agent, without interest promptly
after such surrender, (a) the number of Holdco Shares to which such record
holder was entitled pursuant to this Clause 8.2, (b) at the time of surrender,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after
the date of the Merger Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
date of this surrender and not previously paid and (c) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
those Holdco Shares with a record date on or after the date of the Merger
Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | _No Further Ownership Rights in Eaton Shares_. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Eaton Certificate or Eaton Book-Entry
Share shall, after the Merger Effective Time, represent for all purposes only
the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Clause 8.2, the issuance or payment of which shall be
deemed to be the satisfaction in full of all rights pertaining to Eaton
converted in the Merger. At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of Eaton shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Eaton Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time. If, after the Merger Effective Time, Eaton Certificates or Eaton Book
Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Clause 8.2. 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | _Termination of Eaton Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Eaton Exchange Fund which has not been transferred to the holders of Eaton
Certificates or Eaton Book Entry Shares (as applicable) as of the one-year
anniversary of the Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Holdco or its
designee, upon demand, and the Holdco Shares included therein shall be sold at
the best price reasonably obtainable at that time. Any holder of Eaton
Certificates or Eaton Book Entry Shares (as applicable) who has not complied
with this Clause 8.2 prior to the one-year anniversary of the Merger Effective
Time shall thereafter look only to Holdco for payment of such holders claim
for the Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar applicable Laws). 
---|---|--- 
 



87 Eaton or Cooper or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any person in
respect of any Holdco Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) from the Eaton Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 
---|---|--- 



     | (viii) | _Withholding_. EHC, MergerSub and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Person who was a holder of Eaton Shares immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time such amounts as EHC, MergerSub or the
Exchange Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of federal,
state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by EHC, MergerSub or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person
to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.3 | Eaton Share Awards 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | The Eaton Board or the appropriate committee thereof shall
take all action necessary so that: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | Each option or other right to acquire Eaton Shares granted
under any Eaton Share Plan (an "Eaton Share Option") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
cease to represent an option or other right to acquire Eaton Shares and shall
be converted, at the Effective Time, into an option to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the Eaton Share Option (but
taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the applicable Eaton
Share Plan, in any applicable award agreement or in such option), that number
of Holdco Shares equal to the number of Eaton Shares subject to such Eaton
Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, at a price per share
equal to the per share exercise price specified in such Eaton Share Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | Each issued and outstanding Eaton Share subject to vesting
or other lapse restrictions pursuant to the Eaton Share Plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time (a "Restricted Eaton Share") shall, as of the
Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire an Eaton Share and shall
be converted into the right to receive a Holdco Share, subject to the same
terms and conditions (including vesting and other lapse restrictions) as were
applicable to the Restricted Eaton Share in respect of which it was issued;
and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

Each stock-based award, other than an Eaton Share Option or Restricted Eaton
Share ("Other Eaton Share-Based Awards"), granted under any Eaton Share Plan
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, cease to represent an award based on Eaton Shares and shall be
converted into an award based on a number of Holdco Shares equal to
the number of 

---|---|--- 
 



88 provided that such a converted stock-based right or award shall be subject to
the same terms and conditions (including the vesting terms) as were
applicable to such Other Eaton Share-Based Award in respect of which it was
issued. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Holdco
shall deliver to the holders of Eaton Share Options, Restricted Eaton Shares
and Other Eaton Share-Based Awards appropriate notices setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to the Eaton Share Plans, and the agreements
evidencing the grants of such Eaton Share Options, Restricted Eaton Shares and
Other Eaton Share-Based Awards, as the case may be, shall continue in effect
on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this
Clause 8.3 after giving effect to the Merger and the assumption by Holdco as
set forth above). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Holdco shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve
for issuance a sufficient number of Holdco Shares for delivery with respect to
Eaton Share Options, Restricted Eaton Shares and Other Eaton Share-Based
Awards assumed by it in accordance with this Clause 8.3. As of the Effective
Time, if requested by Eaton prior to the Effective Time, Holdco shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the Holdco Shares subject to such Eaton equity awards
and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Eaton equity awards remain
outstanding. With respect to those individuals who subsequent to the Merger
will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act, where applicable, Holdco shall administer the Eaton Share
Plans assumed pursuant to this Clause 8.3 in a manner that complies with Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the applicable Eaton
Share Plan complied with such rule prior to the Merger.
