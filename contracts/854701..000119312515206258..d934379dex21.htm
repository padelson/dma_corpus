This Amendment No. 2 to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Amendment_
"), dated as of May 29, 2015, is made by and among Uphill Investment Co., a
PRC limited liability company (" _Parent_ "), Indigo Acquisition Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Acquisition
Sub_ "), and Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ ").

 

 _W I T N E S S E T H:_

 

WHEREAS, Parent and the Company have entered into, and Acquisition Sub has
signed a Joinder Agreement joining itself to, that certain Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of March 12, 2015, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 28, 2015 (as amended by
Amendment No. 1, the " _Agreement_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Company, Acquisition Sub and Parent desire to further amend the
Agreement to address certain matters that have arisen since the date of
execution of the Agreement and to make the other changes set forth herein, all
as more fully set forth herein;

WHEREAS, contemporaneous with the execution of this Amendment, the Lender has
executed an amendment to the Bank Letter that provides that the Lender will
fund the amounts required in order to enable Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, as modified by this Amendment
(the " _Amended Bank Letter_ "); and

WHEREAS, _Section 9.13_ of the Agreement authorizes the amendment of the
Agreement by a written instrument signed by or on behalf of each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of and premised upon the representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements of the parties contained in this
Amendment, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

 

1\. _Defined Terms_. Except to the extent it is specifically indicated to the
contrary in this Amendment, all capitalized terms used herein which are
defined in the Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the Agreement.

2.  _Amendment to Merger Consideration_. The Agreement is hereby amended such
that the "Merger Consideration" is defined to be equal to $20.00 per share and
the second "WHEREAS" clause in the Agreement is hereby amended by replacing
"$19.25" with "$20.00". 3\. _Company Stockholder Meeting_. Contemporaneously with the execution of
this Amendment, the Company is rescheduling the Company Stockholder Meeting
to be held on June 12, 2015. Subject to the terms of the Agreement, the
Company shall (i) hold the Company Stockholder Meeting on such date and (ii)
solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the
Merger in accordance with Delaware Law, submit the Merger for approval of the
Company Stockholders at such Company Stockholder Meeting and, unless the
Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have effected a
Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant _Section 6.5(c)_ of the
Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder
Approval on such date at such Company Stockholder Meeting. 

4\. _Superior Proposal_. The Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Acquisition Sub that the Company Board has determined that the current
proposal of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (" _Cypress_ ") to acquire all
of the Companys common stock at a price of $19.75 per share no longer
constitutes nor is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal. Accordingly, the Company shall immediately take with respect to
Cypress and such proposal the actions contemplated by _Section 5.2(a)_ of the
Agreement.

 

5\. _Financing_. For the avoidance of doubt, all references in the Agreement
to the Bank Letter shall be deemed references to the Amended Bank Letter, all
references to the Commitment Letters shall be deemed to include the Amended
Bank Letter and all references to the Debt Financing and the Financing shall
be deemed to include the funding of the amounts contemplated by the
Amended Bank Letter.

6\. _Press Release_. As promptly as practicable after (and in any event no
later than the first Business Day after the date of) the execution of this
Amendment, the Company shall disseminate a press release announcing, among
other things, the execution and delivery of this Amendment in substantially
the form attached hereto as _Schedule A_.

 

7\. _No Other Amendments_. Except to the extent expressly amended by this
Amendment, all terms of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
without amendment, change or modification.

8\. _Governing Law_. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

 

9\. _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Amendment or its subject matter (including a dispute regarding the existence,
validity, formation, effect, interpretation, performance or termination of
this Amendment) (each, a "Dispute") shall be finally settled by arbitration.
The place of arbitration shall be Hong Kong, and the arbitration shall be
administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (the "Centre")
in accordance with the Centres Administered Arbitration Rules in force when
the notice of arbitration is submitted (the "Arbitration Rules"). The
arbitration shall be decided by a tribunal of three (3) arbitrators. Each of
Parent and the Company shall be entitled to nominate

 



2  one (1) arbitrator. The third arbitrator, who shall act as the chairman of
the tribunal, shall be chosen by the two arbitrators nominated by the parties,
respectively. Arbitration proceedings (including but not limited to any
arbitral award rendered) shall be in English.

(b) Subject to the agreement of the tribunal, any Dispute(s) which arise
subsequent to the commencement of arbitration of any existing Dispute(s) shall
be resolved by the tribunal already appointed to hear the existing Dispute(s).
The award of the arbitration tribunal shall be final and conclusive and
binding upon the parties as from the date rendered. Judgment upon any award
may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction over a party or
any of its assets. For the purpose of enforcing this agreement to arbitrate,
the parties irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the jurisdiction of the
courts of Hong Kong and waive any defenses to such enforcement based on lack
of personal jurisdiction or inconvenient forum. For the purpose of enforcement
of an award, the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waive any
defense of inconvenient forum in any court of competent jurisdiction. For the
avoidance of doubt, the arbitration tribunal shall be entitled to impose any
remedy available under this Amendment at law or equity, including without
limitation those remedies contemplated by _Section 9.8_ of the Agreement.

10.  _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Amendment or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties, except that each of Parent and Acquisition Sub may
assign, in Parents sole discretion, any of or all Parents and/or
Acquisition Subs rights, interests and obligations under this Amendment to
any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Acquisition Sub, _provided_ that no
such assignment shall relieve Parent or Acquisition Sub of any of their
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Amendment shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

11\. _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Amendment, this Amendment may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company; _provided, however_ , that
in the event that the Agreement has been adopted by the Company Stockholders
in accordance with Delaware Law, no amendment shall be made to this Amendment
that requires the approval of such Company Stockholders under Delaware Law
without such approval.

 

12\. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable and (b) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or parties hereto
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or parties hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties, as applicable. Any
delay in exercising any right under this Amendment shall not constitute a
waiver of such right.

 



3 13\. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Amendment, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Amendment will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Amendment with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

14\. _Counterparts_. This Amendment may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

15\. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AMENDMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR
THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF OR THEREOF.
