(a)

  |  

In connection with the Asset Sale and upon the terms and subject to the

1.3 Purchase and Sale of the Shares

  

  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall purchase and acquire from the Seller, and the Seller
shall sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to the Buyer, the Shares,
free and clear of all Encumbrances. The foregoing transaction, together with
the Asset Sale, is hereinafter referred to as the "Transactions" and each,
individually, a "Transaction."

  

  

1.4 Purchase Price

  

  

In consideration of the sale by the Seller to the Buyer of the Assets and the
Shares and for the Seller's other covenants and agreements herein, and upon
the assumption by the Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities, the Buyer shall, at
the Closing, pay to the Seller an aggregate purchase price equal to the sum of
(i) the Base Purchase Price plus (ii) the Estimated Closing Date Net Assets
Adjustment (if the Estimated Closing Date Net Assets Adjustment is a positive
number), minus (iii) the absolute value of the Estimated Closing Date Net
Assets Adjustment (if the Estimated Closing Date Net Assets Adjustment is a
negative number), plus (iv) the Estimated Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure
Amount Excess (if any), minus (v) the Estimated Pre-Closing Capital
Expenditure Amount Deficiency (if any), and minus (vi) the Estimated Closing
Date Funded Indebtedness Amount (such sum, the "Purchase Price") (less any
applicable withholding Taxes). The Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price to the
Seller as follows: at the Closing, the Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price by
means of a wire transfer of immediately available U.S. funds to one or more
accounts designated by the Seller to the Buyer at least one (1) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date. The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment
pursuant to Section 1.5 below, and shall be allocated in accordance with
Section 1.6 below.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

1.5 Adjustments to Purchase Price; Closing Date Statement

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall deliver to the Buyer an estimated statement, prepared in good faith (the
"Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth its good faith estimate as of the
Closing Date of: (i) the Closing Date Net Assets (the "Estimated Closing Date
Net Assets"), (ii) the estimated Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure Amount (the
"Estimated Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure Amount"), and (iii) the Closing
Date Funded Indebtedness Amount (the "Estimated Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness Amount"). The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with this Agreement and the Agreed Accounting Principles. The
Seller shall consider in good faith any comments of the Buyer thereon but,
absent manifest error, the Seller shall not be required to adjust its
estimates in response to the Buyer's comments. The Buyer and its
representatives shall have reasonable access during normal business hours to
the books and records, personnel and advisors of the Seller and the Companies
to the extent required in connection with such review, including the Seller's
work papers underlying or utilized in preparing such estimates and the
calculations contained therein. The amount, if any, by which the Estimated
Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure Amount is less than the aggregate amount of
capital expenditures that are contemplated by the CapEx Budget to have been
spent in accordance with the CapEx Budget up to (but not including) the
Closing Date, with the amount contemplated by the CapEx Budget for any partial
quarterly pre-Closing period being determined by pro rating such amount to
reflect the number of days in such partial quarterly period, is referred to
herein as the "Estimated Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure Amount Deficiency."
The amount, if any, by which the Estimated Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure
Amount exceeds the aggregate amount of capital expenditures that are
contemplated by the CapEx Budget to have been spent in accordance with the
CapEx Budget up to (but not including) the Closing Date, with any partial
quarterly pre-Closing periods determined on a pro rata basis as set forth
above, is referred to herein as the "Estimated Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure
Amount Excess."

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

As soon as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, the Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer an unaudited
statement of (i) the Closing Date Net Assets, (ii) the Pre-Closing Capital
Expenditure Amount, and (iii) the Closing Date Funded Indebtedness Amount (the
"Initial Closing Date Statement"). The Initial Closing Date Statement shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with the Agreed Accounting Principles, adjusted
for the Business as purchased and this Agreement. For illustrative purposes
only, an example demonstrating the calculation of Closing Date Net Assets,
Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure Amount, and Closing Date Funded Indebtedness
Amount and a sample Initial Closing Date Statement are set forth on Schedule
1.5.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

If the Buyer notifies the Seller within ninety (90) days of receipt of the
Initial Closing Date Statement of an objection to any item on the Initial
Closing Date Statement, the Buyer and the Seller shall, within sixty (60) days
following such notice (the "Resolution Period"), attempt in good faith to
resolve their differences and any written resolution by them as to any
disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive. The Seller shall
provide the Buyer with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
books, records and personnel of the Seller to the extent necessary to enable
the Buyer to evaluate the Initial Closing Statement. After the end of the
first ninety (90)-day period referred to above, neither Party may introduce
additional objections with respect to any item in the Initial Closing Date
Statement or increase the amount of any objection, and any item not so
identified shall be deemed to be agreed to by the Buyer and the Seller and
shall be final and binding upon the Parties. The Buyer agrees that any failure
by it to notify the Seller of any such objection prior to the expiration of
the ninety (90)-day period immediately following the delivery of the Initial
Closing Date Statement by the Seller shall be deemed to be an acceptance by
the Buyer of the Initial Closing Date Statement and shall constitute a waiver
of any right by the Buyer to dispute such Initial Closing Date Statement for
all purposes.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

If at the conclusion of the Resolution Period there remains any dispute
regarding any item on the Initial Closing Date Statement, then such dispute
shall be submitted to an impartial nationally recognized major accounting firm
selected by the Seller and the Buyer within ten (10) days after the expiration
of the Resolution Period (the "Neutral Auditors"). If the Seller and the Buyer
are unable to agree on the Neutral Auditors, then each of the Seller and the
Buyer shall select an impartial nationally recognized major accounting firm,
and the two (2) firms will mutually select a third impartial nationally
recognized major accounting firm to serve as the Neutral Auditors. For
purposes of this Section 1.5(d), an auditor is "impartial" if it has not
conducted auditing work for either Party within the past two (2) years. One-
half of all fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by
the Neutral Auditors shall be borne by the Buyer, and one-half shall be borne
by the Seller. The Neutral Auditor shall select as a resolution the position
of either the Buyer or the Seller for each item in dispute and may not impose
an alternative resolution. The Neutral Auditors shall act as an expert and not
as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on presentations by the Seller and
the Buyer and their respective advisors, only those issues still in dispute.
The Neutral Auditors' determination shall be made within thirty (30) days of
the presentations by the Seller and the Buyer and their respective advisors,
shall be consistent with the manner and standards described in this Section
1.5(d) and the Agreed Accounting Principles, shall be set forth in a written
statement delivered to the Seller and the Buyer, and shall be final, binding
and conclusive. The Initial Closing Date Statement as accepted by the Buyer
pursuant to Section 1.5(c) and/or adjusted by agreement of the Parties or to
reflect the determinations of the Neutral Auditors pursuant to this Section
1.5(d) shall constitute the "Final Closing Date Statement," the amount of the
Closing Date Net Assets as reflected on the Final Closing Date Statement shall
be the "Final Closing Date Net Assets", the Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure
Amount as reflected on the Final Closing Date Statement shall be the "Final
Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure Amount," and the Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness Amount as reflected on the Final Closing Date Statement shall be
the "Final Closing Date Funded Indebtedness Amount."

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(e)

  |  

Intentionally Omitted.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(f)

  |  

The difference between the Final Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure Amount and
the Estimated Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure Amount shall be referred to
herein as the "Final Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure Adjustment." If the Final
Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure Amount is greater than the Estimated Pre-
Closing Capital Expenditure Amount, then the Final Pre-Closing Capital
Expenditure Adjustment shall be a positive number. If the Final Pre-Closing
Capital Expenditure Amount is less than the Estimated Pre-Closing Capital
Expenditure Amount, then the Final Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure Adjustment
shall be a negative number.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(g)

  |  

The difference between the Final Closing Date Funded Indebtedness Amount and
the Estimated Closing Date Customer Funded Indebtedness shall be referred to
herein as the "Final Closing Date Funded Indebtedness Adjustment." If the
amount of the Final Closing Date Funded Indebtedness Amount is greater than
the amount of the Estimated Closing Date Funded Indebtedness Amount, then the
Final Closing Date Funded Indebtedness Adjustment shall be a negative number.
If the amount of the Final Closing Date Funded Indebtedness Amount is less
than the amount of the Estimated Closing Date Funded Indebtedness Amount, then
the Final Closing Date Funded Indebtedness Adjustment shall be a positive
number. The sum of the Final Closing Date Net Assets Adjustment, the Final
Pre-Closing Capital Expenditure Adjustment and the Final Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness Adjustment is referred to herein as the "Final Purchase Price
Adjustment."

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(h)

  |  

If the Final Purchase Price Adjustment is a negative number, then the amount
of the Purchase Price minus the absolute value of the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment shall be the "Final Purchase Price," and if the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment is a positive number, then the amount of the Purchase Price
plus the Final Purchase Price Adjustment shall be the "Final Purchase Price."
If the Final Purchase Price Adjustment is a negative number, then the Seller
shall pay to the Buyer the absolute value of the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment (less any applicable withholding Taxes), along with interest
accrued thereon. If the Final Purchase Price Adjustment is a positive number,
then the Buyer shall pay to the Seller the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
(less any applicable withholding Taxes), along with interest accrued thereon.
Interest on the amount of such difference shall accrue, commencing on the
Closing Date until date of payment, at a rate per annum equal to the prime
rate as published in TheWall Street Journal and in effect on the Closing Date.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Payment of any amounts due the Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be,
pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall be made within five (5) Business Days after
the ninetieth (90th) day of receipt of the Final Closing Date Statement if not
objected to by the Buyer or five (5) Business Days after any agreement by the
Seller and the Buyer or the decision of the Neutral Auditors, as the case may
be.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

1.6 Allocation of Purchase Price

  

  

The Buyer and the Seller shall determine and prepare separate allocations of
the Final Purchase Price among the assets sold to the Buyer for Tax purposes
in their sole discretion (the "Purchase Price Allocations"), and there shall
be no requirement that the Purchase Price Allocations be consistent with each
other. To the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, the Buyer and
the Seller (as the case may be) shall cooperate with the requesting Party in
providing documents and information necessary to enable the requesting Party
to prepare its separate Purchase Price Allocation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

1.7 Certain Consents

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent that any of the Assigned Contracts, or any of the rights or claims
described in Section 1.1(a)(x) or Liabilities of the Seller described in
Section 1.2(a)(i) are not assignable without the consent, waiver or approval
of another party, this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment or an
attempted assignment or assumption or attempted assumption thereof if such
assignment, attempted assignment, assumption or attempted assumption would
constitute a violation of a Requirement of Law or a breach or default under
such Assigned Contract or otherwise trigger any termination or renegotiation
right of such other party to the Assigned Contract.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate and use
reasonable efforts to obtain such consents and novations in accordance with
Section 5.2. If any such consent or novation shall not be obtained prior to
the Closing Date, except with respect to Government Contracts that are
addressed in Section 6.4, the Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate in good
faith to mutually agree upon a reasonable arrangement (including entering into
agreements between the Parties) designed to provide or transfer to the Buyer
the benefits intended to be assigned to, and the burdens and Liabilities
intended to be assumed by, the Buyer, including, with respect to any Assigned
Contract, at the Buyer's request, enforcement at the cost and for the account
of the Buyer of any and all rights of the Seller against the other party
thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation thereof by such other party
or otherwise; provided, that the Buyer shall (i) pay or satisfy the
corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefit to the extent that
the Buyer or the Companies would have been responsible therefor if such
consent or novation had been obtained; (ii) enter into a written Contract with
the Seller to act as a subcontractor of the Seller to perform any and all
obligations of the Seller under each aforementioned Assigned Contract for the
duration of such Assigned Contract (including any automatic extensions or
renewals) and only for the exact amounts payable to the Seller under such
Assigned Contract for the performance of such obligations; (iii) be
responsible for all of the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the Buyer in performing its obligations under such Assigned
Contract as a subcontractor of the Seller under subparagraph (ii) above; (iv)
indemnify the Seller in full for any Losses suffered or incurred by the Seller
to the extent arising out of or relating to the Buyer's performance as a
subcontractor of the Seller under subparagraph (ii) above; and (v) procure
that the Companies shall refrain from taking any action that would reasonably
be expected to have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt
of any such consents and novations.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

1.8 Further Assurances

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

At and after the Closing, and without further consideration therefor, (a) the
Seller shall execute and deliver to the Buyer such further instruments and
certificates of conveyance and transfer as the Buyer may reasonably request in
order to more effectively convey and transfer the Assets and the Shares from
the Seller to the Buyer and to put the Buyer in control of the Business; (b)
the Buyer shall execute, or shall arrange the execution of, and deliver to the
Seller such further instruments and certificates of assumption, novation and
release as the Seller may reasonably request in order to effectively make the
Buyer responsible for all Assumed Liabilities and release the Seller therefrom
to the fullest extent permitted under Requirements of Law; and (c) each of the
Parties shall use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or
advisable under Requirements of Law, and execute and deliver such documents
and other papers, as may be required to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

(b)

  |  

Without limiting the generality of Section 1.8(a), to the extent that,
following the Closing, the Parties mutually determine in good faith that any
asset or Liability that was intended to be transferred pursuant to this
Agreement was not transferred on the Closing Date (such Asset or Liability, an
"Omitted Asset" or "Omitted Liability," respectively), then, as applicable:
(i) the Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly assign and
transfer to the Buyer or its designated assignee, all right, title and
interest in such Omitted Asset or (ii) the Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, promptly assume such Omitted Liability and shall thereafter
pay, perform, discharge or otherwise satisfy such Omitted Liability in
accordance with its terms. From the time such Omitted Asset or Omitted
Liability is discovered until such time as it is transferred to the proper
Party or its designated assignee, Section 1.7(b) shall apply mutatis mutandis.
Upon execution of such assignment or assumption, such Omitted Asset or Omitted
Liability, as applicable, shall automatically and immediately be deemed to be
included in and constitute an Asset or Assumed Liability, as applicable, and
included on the appropriate Schedule, if applicable, as of the date of this
Agreement and without the need for any additional consideration, and any
failure to deliver an Omitted Asset or assume an Assumed Liability at the
Closing shall not, in and of itself, constitute a breach of this Agreement if
and to the extent such omission is fully cured.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

1.9 Separate Transactions

  

  

Each Transaction is independent, separate and discrete from each other
Transaction for Tax and accounting purposes and asset conveyance
documentation. Notwithstanding such separate treatment, no Transaction may
close without all Transactions closing at the same time (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, certain Assigned Contracts, Assigned Government Contracts
and the Environmental Permits set forth on Schedule 6.9 may be assigned or
transferred after the Closing Date in accordance with this Agreement).

  

  

SECTION 2. CLOSING

  

  

2.1 Closing Date

  

  

Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of
the Transactions (the "Closing") shall be consummated on a date and at a time
agreed upon by the Buyer and the Seller, but in no event later than 10:00 A.M.
New York City time on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the conditions set
forth in Sections 7 and 8 have been satisfied or waived (except for those
conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), at such place as shall be
agreed upon by the Buyer and the Seller; provided, that notwithstanding the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 7 and 8, if the
Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions, then the Buyer shall not be required to effect the Closing
until the earlier of (a) a date during the Marketing Period specified by the
Buyer on no less than three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Seller and (b) the final day of the Marketing Period. The time and date on

4.8 Purchase of the Shares

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

The Buyer understands that the Shares to be acquired by the Buyer at the
Closing will not be registered under the Securities Act on the grounds that
the sale of such Shares pursuant to this Agreement is exempt from registration
under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof, and that the
Seller's reliance on such exemption is predicated on the Buyer's
representations set forth herein.

   
---|---

copies of any executed binding debt commitment letter, and any fee letter with
customary redactions consistent with the requirements of the Debt Commitment
Letter, as well as any term sheets, schedules, exhibits and annexes thereto
(together, the "Debt Commitment Letter") from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding,
Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (the "Lenders" and, together with each
other entity that has committed to provide or otherwise entered into
agreements in connection with the Financing and their respective officers,
employees, directors, affiliates, partners, controlling parties, advisors,
agents and representatives, the "Financing Sources" ) pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Lenders have committed to
provide loans in the amounts described therein (the "Financing Commitments"),
the proceeds of which shall be used to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated by the Buyer (the "Financing"). The
Financing Commitments have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or
waived on or prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date. The
Financing Commitments are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Buyer
and, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, the other parties thereto.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

As of the date hereof, each of the Financing Commitments is in full force and
effect except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and (ii) general principles of
equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is sought in a proceeding at
law or in equity). As of the date hereof, no event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent
on the part of the Buyer under the terms and conditions of the Financing
Commitments. As of the date hereof, no Financing Commitment has been withdrawn
or terminated and no Lender has notified the Buyer of its intention to
terminate any of the Financing Commitments or to not provide the Financing. As

conditions in Section 7 and subject to the terms and conditions of the
Financing Commitments and this Agreement, Buyer shall have immediately
available to it, sufficient funds to consummate the Transactions pursuant to
Section 1.4 and Section 1.5 and to pay all fees and expenses due at the
Closing. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 7 and the
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, to the Knowledge of the
Buyer, there is no fact or occurrence as of the date hereof that would cause
the conditions to funding of the Financing not to be satisfied at the Closing,
and the Buyer has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained
in the Financing Commitments and this Agreement. The Buyer has paid or caused
to be paid in full any and all commitment or other fees required by the
Financing Commitments that are due and payable as of the date hereof.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of
the commitments under the Financing Commitments or any contingencies that
would permit the Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Financing
Commitments, other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the
Financing Commitments and the payment of fees payable pursuant to the fee
letters with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no side letters or other contracts or arrangements
related to the Financing other than the Financing Commitments.

4.11 No Other Representations and Warranties

  

  

NEITHER THE BUYER NOR ANY OTHER PERSON HAS MADE OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE
MADE, AND NEITHER THE BUYER, NOR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES IS OR ARE LIABLE FOR OR BOUND IN ANY MANNER BY, ANY
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, GUARANTIES, PROMISES OR
STATEMENTS, EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 4. THE BUYER
MAKES NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 5. ACTIONS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE

  

  

The Buyer and the Seller covenant and agree to take the following actions
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date:

  

  

5.1 Access to Information

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

Except as may be prohibited by Requirements of Law, the Seller shall afford,
and shall cause the Companies to afford, to the officers, employees and
authorized representatives of the Buyer (including independent public
accountants, financial advisors and attorneys) reasonable access during normal
business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the offices, properties,
employees and business and financial records (including computer files,
retrieval programs and similar documentation) located on the Owned Real
Property or the Leased Real Property (to the extent they are not privileged)
and shall furnish to the Buyer or its authorized representatives such
additional information concerning the Company Group and relating primarily to
the Business as shall be reasonably requested by the Buyer, in each case in
order to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments, prepare pro forma
financial statements for the Business, and to plan for an orderly transition
of ownership and operation of the Business; provided, however, that (i) no
member of the Company Group shall be required to violate any obligation of
confidentiality to which such member or any of its Affiliates may be subject
in discharging their obligations pursuant to this Section 5.1(a), (ii) the
Seller shall not be required to make available, or cause the Companies to make
available, Business Employee personnel files to the extent disclosure is
subject to limitations or requirements relating to employee data privacy laws,
and (iii) in no event shall the Buyer be permitted to conduct any Phase II
environmental site assessment or conduct any sampling of soil, sediment,
surface water, ground water or building material at, on, under or within any
Facility. The Buyer agrees that any permitted investigation undertaken by the
Buyer pursuant to the access granted under this Section 5.1(a) shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation
of the Business by any member of the Company Group, and that the Buyer and its
affiliates and representatives shall not contact or speak to any of the
employees of the Company Group without the prior written consent of the
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no member
of the Company Group or RDA shall be required to provide access to or disclose
information where, upon the advice of counsel, such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or contravene any
Requirement of Law.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

As soon as reasonably practicable after the end of each calendar month and
each fiscal quarter (but, in no event later than thirty (30) days after the
end of each month and sixty (60) days after the end of each fiscal quarter)
during the period from the date hereof to the Closing, the Seller shall
provide the Buyer with an unaudited, combined and consolidated balance sheet
and income statement of the Business for the fiscal quarter then ended or the
month then ended, in each case prepared consistent with past practice in the
Ordinary Course.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(c)

Schedules within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement.

respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, things necessary, proper or advisable under any
Requirements of Laws to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious
manner practicable the Transactions, including (i) the preparation and filing
of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the
Transactions, (ii) the satisfaction of the other Party's conditions to
consummating the Transactions, (iii) taking all reasonable actions necessary
to obtain (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent,

including any Governmental Authority (which actions shall include furnishing
all information required under the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of
or filings with any Governmental Authority responsible for or having
jurisdiction over antitrust, competition, trade regulation, foreign investment
and/or national security or defense matters) required to be obtained or made
by the Buyer or the Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries or RDA in
connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by
this Agreement, including obtaining written consents for the assignment and
novation of (and release of the Seller by such Third Party from) all
Liabilities under each of the Leases and Contracts from any third party whose
consent is required (but, for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge
that Federal Acquisition Regulation Section 42.1204(h)(3) restricts the
release of the Seller from certain Liabilities), and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
Additionally, each of the Buyer and the Seller shall use all reasonable best
efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to this Agreement and shall not
take any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any
permission, approval or consent from any such Governmental Authority necessary
to be obtained prior to the Closing.

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

Prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Seller shall each keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transactions and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required
consents, authorizations, orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any
Governmental Authority or other Third Party, including by working
cooperatively in connection with any sales, divestitures or dispositions of
assets or businesses if and to the extent undertaken pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 5.2. In that regard, prior to the Closing, subject
to the JDA, the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 11.2 of this Agreement,
each Party shall promptly consult with the other Parties to this Agreement to
provide any necessary information with respect to (and, in the case of
correspondence from either a Party to the Governmental Authority (or vice
versa), provide the other Party (or their counsel) copies of such
correspondence or any other memoranda, PowerPoint or other documents prepared
by a party for the purpose of submission to the Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions) all filings made by such Party with any
Governmental Authority or any other information supplied by such Party to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions. Subject to the JDA, the Confidentiality
Agreement and Section 11.2, each Party shall promptly inform the other Party,
and if in writing, furnish the other Party with copies of (or, in the case of
material oral communications, advise the other Party orally of) any
communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the
Transactions, and permit the other Party to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other Party in connection with, any
proposed written (or any material proposed oral) communication with any such
Governmental Authority. If either Party or any representative of such Party
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, then such Party will
use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after
consultation with the other Party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. Neither Party shall participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
(or make oral submissions at meetings or in telephone or other conversations)
unless it consults with the other Party in advance and to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Authority gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Subject to the JDA, the
Confidentiality Agreement and Section 11.2, each Party shall furnish the other
Party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
Party may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary
filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental Authority.
Subject to the JDA, the materials provided pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) may
be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Business,
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns. To the extent that
transfers of any permits issued by any Governmental Authority are required as
a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such
transfers.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

The Buyer and the Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, notifications under the HSR Act, and the
Buyer and the Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as
practicable, any other filings and/or notifications under applicable Antitrust
Laws. In the event that the Parties receive a request for information or
documentary materials following the HSR Act filing (a "Second Request"), the
Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such
Second Request, as applicable, as promptly as practicable and counsel for both
Parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request
review process.

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall use all reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other United States federal or state or foreign or
supranational Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). In connection therewith, if an Action is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the
Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Laws, each of the Buyer and the
Seller shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest
and resist any such Action including litigating until a Court Order has been
issued. Buyer shall have the exclusive right to direct and control the defense
of any such Action with counsel of its own choosing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section
5.2(d) shall limit the right of either Party to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1(d), 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) so long as such Party has, up
to the time of termination, complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 5.2. Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable after the
execution of this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(e)

the Seller. The DeSoto Nordhoff Agreements also contemplate PWR granting
certain ingress and egress easements across the DeSoto Facility. In connection
with the foregoing, PWR shall consent to a purchase and sale agreement between
Seller and any other third party to whom Seller intends to sell the Excluded
Portion of the DeSoto Facility; provided, that PWR shall have no obligation or
cost with respect to such third party other than to perform its obligations as

to, amend, modify or terminate the MHI Agreements without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,

provided, that if the Buyer agrees to an MHI Settlement in excess of thirteen

Settlement by MHI and PWR, the Seller shall promptly upon demand by the Buyer,
but in no event more than five (5) Business Days after such demand, (i) pay to
MHI or its Affiliates any amounts due and payable to MHI pursuant to the MHI

payment to MHI pursuant to the MHI Settlement (such amount, the "MHI
Settlement Payment") is less than nine million dollars ($9,000,000), pay to
PWR an amount equal to one half of the difference between thirteen million
dollars ($13,000,000) and the amount of the MHI Settlement Payment, in each
case in immediately available funds to an account designated by the recipient.

of its efforts to arrange the Financing; provided, that in the event the Buyer
becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes procurement of any
portion of the Financing unlikely to occur in the manner or from the sources
contemplated in the Financing Commitments, the Buyer shall promptly notify the
Seller and shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange as promptly as
practicable any such portion from alternative sources on terms and conditions
no less favorable to the Buyer's ability to consummate the Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Seller (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), (i) amend, modify, supplement or waive any
of the conditions to funding contained in the Financing Commitments or any
other provision thereof or remedies thereunder, in each case to the extent
such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the ability of the Buyer to timely consummate the

satisfied or delaying the Closing), or (ii) amend, modify, supplement or waive
any of the conditions to funding contained in the Financing Commitments or any
other provision thereof, or remedies thereunder.

(c)

  |  

In the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date, upon request of

legal and accounting), to cooperate in connection with the arrangement and
obtaining of the Financing in the amounts and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments, pursuant to the which the
Lenders have agreed to provide the Financing; provided, that such cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Seller and
its Subsidiaries). Seller's cooperation shall include, without limitation: (i)
providing the Buyer from time to time information regarding the Business and
its industry reasonably requested by the lenders providing the Financing, (ii)
using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the efforts to syndicate
the Financing benefit from existing lending relationships of the Seller and
its Subsidiaries, (iii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions with
prospective lenders and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the
Financing, including direct contact (to the extent consistent with their

advisors (including accounting advisors) of the Seller and its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and the Lenders, potential lenders and investors for the
Financing, on the other hand, (iv) assisting with the preparation of materials
for rating agency presentations, offering and syndication documents (including
prospectuses, offering memoranda, private placement memoranda and lender and
investor presentations), business projections and similar marketing documents
required in connection with the Financing (all such documents and materials,
collectively the "Offering Documents") and other materials to be used in
connection with obtaining the Financing and all documentation and other
information required by Governmental Authorities under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including U.S.A.
Patriot Act of 2001, (v) as promptly as reasonably practical after the Buyer's
request, furnishing the Buyer and the Lenders all Required Information,
including all information and disclosures reasonably requested by the Buyer to
assist with preparation of the Offering Documents, including customary
authorization and management representation letters, (vi) reasonably
cooperating in satisfying the conditions precedent set forth in the Financing
Commitments or any definitive document relating to the Financing (to the
extent the satisfaction of such condition requires the cooperation of, and is
within the control of, the Seller and is customary and reasonable), (vii)
issuing customary representation letters to auditors and using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain (A) accountants comfort letters and consents to
the use of accountants' audit reports relating to the Seller, (B) consents and
waivers and legal opinions, and (C) other documentation and items contemplated
by the Financing as reasonably requested by Buyer, (viii) executing and
delivering, as of the Closing Date, any pledge and security documents, other
definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, and
(ix) as of or subject to the occurrence of the Closing, taking all corporate
actions necessary to authorize the consummation of the Financing and to permit
the proceeds thereof to be made available to the Buyer immediately upon the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (X) neither the Seller nor any of
its Affiliates shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee,
provide any security or incur any other Liability in connection with the
Financing, (Y) nothing in this Section 5.12 shall require the Seller, the
Companies or their senior officers to engage in any action that would
interfere unreasonably with their respective businesses and (Z) the
effectiveness of any Encumbrance or documentation executed by the Seller or
any of its Affiliates with respect to the Financing shall be subject to the
consummation of the Closing (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the existence of
any such Encumbrances shall not constitute a violation of any representation
or warranty of the Seller in this Agreement). The Seller will use reasonable
efforts to update any Required Information to be included in the Offering
Document to be used in connection with such Financing as reasonably requested
by Buyer. The Buyer shall promptly, upon request by the Seller, reimburse the
Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. For the
avoidance of doubt, any information provided to the Buyer pursuant to this
Section 5.12(c) shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Section
11.2; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, the Buyer may include confidential
information regarding the Business and the Companies in presentations to
rating agencies so long as the Buyer affords the Seller a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and considers the Seller's comments
in good faith.

similar to the Retained Marks or a variant of, any of the foregoing as a part
of any name or Mark (whether alone or in combination with any other words,
phrases or designs, including any variants of the foregoing), as promptly as
commercially practicable after the Closing Date and in no event later than
sixty (60) days following the date thereof, (y) shall promptly, but in no
event later than sixty (60) days after the Closing, cause PWR and PWPG to
change their corporate names to remove any reference to the names "Pratt and
Whitney," "PandW," "United Technologies Corporation," "UTC," "Hamilton
Sundstrand," "Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International," "HSSSI,"
"PWR," or any variant thereof (the "Retained Names"), and (z) for a period not
to exceed sixty (60) days from the Closing Date, shall have the right to use
existing stationery, packaging, labeling, containers, supplies, technical data
sheets and any similar materials acquired pursuant to this Agreement without
modifying any Retained Mark or Retained Name thereon. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Section 6.1(a) shall be deemed to prohibit the Buyer's
or any Company's use of the words "Technology", "System", "International" or
"Corporation" or any other terms, words, or formatives that do not have
trademark significance, or any variant thereof, in any manner that is not
otherwise a variant of and does not cause a likelihood of confusion with any
Retained Mark.

(b)

Except as set forth in Section 6.1(c), from and after the Closing Date, the
Seller shall (and shall cause each of its Affiliates to), as promptly as
commercially practicable after the Closing Date (but in any event no later
than thirty (30) days thereafter), cease all uses of and shall not (and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to not) use at any time thereafter the name
"Rocketdyne" and the "R Rocket" design shown in U.S. Trademark Registration
3,570,325, or any other names or Marks included in the Company Intellectual
Property or the Transferred Intellectual Property or any other name or Mark
that is confusingly similar to, or a variant of, any of the foregoing as a
part of any name or Mark (including in the name of the Seller or any of its
respective Affiliates) (whether alone or in combination with any other words,
phrases or designs, including any variants of the foregoing).

In the event that either Party or any of its Affiliates violates any of its
obligations under this Section 6.1, the other Party may proceed against it in
law or in equity for such damages or other relief as a court may deem
appropriate. Each Party acknowledges that a violation of this Section 6.1 may
cause the other Party irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated
for by money damages. Each Party therefore agrees that in the event of any
actual or threatened violation of this Section 6.1, the other Party and its
Affiliates shall be entitled, in addition to other remedies that they may
have, to seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary and final
injunctive relief against such Party or such Party's Affiliate to prevent any
violations of this Section 6.1, without, to the extent permitted by
Requirements of Law, the necessity of posting a bond.

6.2 Employees; Employee Benefits

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

Treatment of Business Employees. Effective as of immediately prior to the
Closing, the Seller shall (or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to)
transfer the employment of each (i) Business Employee who, as of immediately
prior to the Closing, is employed by the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller
that is not a Company or a Subsidiary of any Company from the Seller (or such
Affiliate) to a Company or a Subsidiary of any such Company, and (ii) employee
who is not a Business Employee and who, as of immediately prior to the
Closing, is employed by a Company or a Subsidiary of a Company from such
Company (or a Subsidiary of such Company) to the Seller or an Affiliate of the
Seller that is not a Company or a Subsidiary of any Company, as designated by
the Seller. With respect to each Business Employee who is not covered by a
collective bargaining Contract (each, a "Non-Union Business Employee"), the
Buyer shall maintain during the Continuation Period the same wage rate or cash
salary level in effect for such employee immediately prior to the Closing and
compensation, benefit plans and fringe benefits that, in the aggregate, are of
the same or substantially the same value, as those in effect immediately prior
to the Closing; provided, that with respect to any equity-based or cash-based
incentive compensation and benefit programs, Buyer shall provide during the
Continuation Period benefits that are substantially of the same value, in all
material respects, and Buyer shall have the sole discretion to determine cash
and equity components of such benefits. The Buyer will also recognize each
Business Employee's seniority date with the Company Group under its
compensation and fringe benefit programs (where such date is relevant)
consistent with the Buyer's treatment of the Buyer's employees generally.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall not be prohibited by this
Section 6.2(a) from terminating the employment of any Business Employee
following the Closing Date (it being understood that Business Employees will
all be at-will unless such Business Employees have employment agreements for a
fixed employment term), subject, however, to the Buyer's obligations under
Section 6.2(d) and Section 6.2(l). Benefits and compensation for employees
subject to a collective bargaining Contract (each, a "Union Business
Employee") shall be provided in accordance with the applicable Contract and
subsequent negotiations between the Buyer and collective bargaining
representatives.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

Service Credit. As of and after the Closing, the Buyer shall, or shall cause
the applicable Company to, give each Business Employee full credit for all
purposes under any Company Benefit Plans and each other employee benefit plan,
policy or arrangement, in each case maintained for the benefit of Business
Employees as of and after the Closing by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
for such Business Employee's service prior to the Closing with the Seller and
its applicable Affiliates (including the Companies) and their respective
predecessors, to the same extent such service is recognized by Seller and its
applicable Affiliates (including the Companies) immediately prior to the
Closing under an analogous Benefit Plan; provided, that except as set forth in
Section 6.2(h)(iii), such credit shall not be provided for purposes of benefit
accrual under defined benefit pension plans or in the event duplication of
benefits would result.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

Health Coverages. The Buyer shall cause each Business Employee (and his or her
"eligible dependents," as defined in the Benefit Plans) to be covered through
at least the end of the Continuation Period by a group health plan or plans
that (i) comply with the provisions of Section 6.2(a), (ii) do not limit or
exclude coverage on the basis of any pre-existing condition of such Business
Employee or dependent (other than any limitation already in effect under the
applicable group health Benefit Plan) or on the basis of any other exclusion
or waiting period not in effect under the applicable group health Benefit
Plan, and (iii) provide each Business Employee full credit, for the year in
which the Closing Date occurs, for any deductible or co-payment already
incurred by the Business Employee under the applicable group health Benefit
Plan and for any other out-of-pocket expenses that count against any maximum
out-of-pocket expense provision of the applicable group health Benefit Plan or
the Buyer's group health plans.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

Severance. The Seller shall be responsible for all severance Liabilities with
respect to Business Employees that arise from or become payable prior to or on
the Closing Date pursuant to any Contract or Seller Benefit Plan (it being
understood that the Seller shall not be responsible, and the Buyer shall be
responsible, for any severance Liabilities with respect to Business Employees
that arise as a result of or in connection with a breach by the Buyer and its
Affiliates of their obligations hereunder). With respect to each Business
Employee whose employment is terminated without Cause by the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries during the Continuation Period, the Buyer shall provide severance
payments and benefits in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 6.2(d).
For this purpose, "Cause" means the applicable Business Employee's (i)
conviction of a felony; (ii) commission of a willful and material act of
dishonesty involving the Business; (iii) material breach of any fiduciary duty
owed to the Business; (iv) material breach of the policies or procedures of
the Buyer and its Affiliates that causes material harm to the Business; or (v)
other willful misconduct that causes material harm to the Business.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(e)

  |  

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans. Effective as of the Closing, the
Seller shall cause the accrued benefits and account balances of all Business
Employees who are participants in any Benefit Plan that is a non-qualified
deferred compensation plan to become fully vested.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(f)

  |  

Accrued Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time. The Buyer will recognize and
assume the liability with respect to accrued but unused vacation time for
Business Employees to the extent reflected as a liability in the Final Closing
Date Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall pay any
accrued but unused vacation time or paid time off for Business Employees with
respect to whom such a payment is required by Requirements of Law; provided,
that to the extent paid by the Seller prior to or at the Closing, no liability
shall be reflected on the Final Closing Date Statement in respect of such
vacation time or paid time off. Current, pre-funded and unused sick leave
accounts as reflected on the Seller's books and records will be Excluded
Liabilities. The Buyer shall allow Business Employees to use the vacation time
recognized in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 6.2(f) in
accordance with the terms of those Company Group programs in effect
immediately prior to the Closing. During the Continuation Period, except as
otherwise specifically provided in this Section 6.2(f), the Buyer's policies
of vacation and the Buyer's payroll policies will be substantially similar in
all material respects to the policies that were in effect for Business
Employees immediately prior to the Closing.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(g)

  |  

Disability Benefits; Military Leave. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
6.2(a), the Seller (or its applicable Affiliate that is not a Company or a
Subsidiary of any Company) shall employ and be responsible for continuing any
salary continuation, disability benefits, and all other compensation and
benefits for any Business Employee who is receiving or eligible to receive
short-term or long-term disability benefits immediately prior to the Closing.
If any such employee is able to return to work during the Continuation Period
(or during such longer period mandated by an applicable collective bargaining
agreement or by Requirement of Law), or if any Business Employee on military
leave as of the Closing Date (or other individual who would have been a
Business Employee but for such military leave) is able to return to work
during such period as is mandated by Requirement of Law, the Buyer shall offer
employment to such employee on terms consistent with those applicable to
Business Employees generally under this Section 6.2, and each such employee
who accepts such offer of employment with the Buyer shall, for the avoidance
of doubt, be a Business Employee on the date such employee commences work with
the Buyer.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(h)

  |  

Pension Plans.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

The Buyer shall not assume any obligations under or Liabilities with respect
to, or receive a transfer of any assets of, any Pension Plans, including the
Seller Pension Plan. The accrued benefit of Pension Participants (as defined
below) under the Seller Pension Plan shall not be adjusted following the
Closing Date on account of service with the Buyer and its Affiliates,
increases or decreases in compensation following the Closing or any other
reason (other than in accordance with the terms thereof upon the reemployment
of a Pension Participant by Seller and its Affiliates).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
establish or designate, effective as of the Closing Date, a defined benefit
pension plan and trust intended to be qualified under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code (the "Buyer Pension Plan"), which shall
cover Union Business Employees who are participants in the Seller Pension Plan
immediately prior to the Closing (the "Pension Participants"), and the Parties
shall cooperate in good faith to effect such establishment or designation as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date. The Buyer shall, with
respect to the participation of each Pension Participant, continue to maintain
the Buyer Pension Plan on the terms contemplated by this Section 6.2(h) at
least until expiration of the collective bargaining Contract applicable to
such Pension Participant.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

  |  

(iii)

  |  

The Buyer Pension Plan shall, with respect to the Pension Participants,
contain terms substantially identical to those of the Seller Pension Plan, and
the Buyer shall cause the Buyer Pension Plan to credit each Pension
Participant with full past service credit for eligibility, vesting, benefit
accrual, determination of eligibility for early retirement and other
subsidized benefits and all other purposes from his or her date of employment
with the Seller and its Affiliates (and predecessors) to the extent such
service was credited for such purpose on behalf of such Pension Participant
under the Seller Pension Plan.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iv)

  |  

The accrued benefit of each Pension Participant under the Buyer Pension Plan
as of the Closing Date, taking into account service as described in Section
6.2(h)(iii) but not taking into account the benefit offset described in the
last sentence of this Section 6.2(h)(iv), will be at least as great as the
accrued benefit of such Pension Participant under the Seller Pension Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date. The optional forms of benefit, early
retirement benefit provisions and other "Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits"
(within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.411(d)-4) applicable to each
Pension Participant under the Seller Pension Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date will be applicable to such Pension Participant under the Buyer
Pension Plan as of and following the Closing Date to the extent mandated under
Requirements of Law. The benefit of each Pension Participant under the Buyer
Pension Plan shall be reduced by the benefit of such Pension Participant under
the Seller Pension Plan, determined based on the benefit earned under the
Seller Pension Plan (for clarity, determined based upon the accrued benefit
earned under the Seller Pension Plan and the applicable early retirement
factor for which such Pension Participant would have been eligible as of the
Closing Date).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(v)

  |  

The Seller and Buyer agree to coordinate efforts to make all necessary
amendments to the Seller Pension Plan and Buyer Pension Plan, as applicable,
as soon as practicable following the Closing Date to effectuate the provisions
of this Section 6.2(h). In the event that any of the provisions in this
Section 6.2(h) are found by either Party in good faith to be unenforceable or
impermissible under Federal pension statute or pension regulations, the
Parties agree to coordinate efforts to effect comparable and permissible
changes to the respective pension plans that minimize the operational and
financial differences of any necessary changes from the arrangement
anticipated in this Section 6.2(h).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(vi)

  |  

Effective as of the Closing Date, the Seller shall fully vest the accrued
benefits of each Non-Union Business Employee who is a participant in the
United Technologies Corporation Employee Retirement Plan.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(vii)

  |  

The Seller is responsible for resolving with the United States Government any
adjustment of prior period pension costs associated with the Seller Pension
Plan that may be due to or from a Governmental Authority under the provisions
of Cost Accounting Standard 413.50(c)(12). The Seller will be responsible for
making any payment due to any such Governmental Authority under that provision
and will be entitled to any payment due from such Governmental Authority. The
Buyer will provide the support reasonably needed by the Seller to resolve any
adjustment due under that provision, including but not limited to access to
records in the custody of the Buyer and its Affiliates and assistance from
employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

401(k) Plan. Effective at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing, the Buyer shall establish, and the Seller shall reasonably cooperate
with the Buyer to establish, participation by the Business Employees in the
Buyer's tax-qualified defined contribution plan or plans with a cash or
deferred feature (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan") for the benefit of each Business
Employee who, as of immediately prior to the Closing, was eligible to
participate in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the
Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller (collectively, the "Seller 401(k) Plan").
If the Buyer 401(k) Plan is not established effective as of the Closing Date,
the Buyer will, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Buyer 401(k) Plan
is established, make a matching contribution with respect to each Business
Employee who participated in the Seller 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the
Closing in an amount equal to the amount that otherwise would have been
contributed in respect of such Business Employee had the Buyer 401(k) Plan
been in effect immediately after the Closing. Thereafter, the Buyer shall
continue to make available and maintain the Buyer 401(k) Plan for a period
ending no earlier than the end of the Continuation Period. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, the Seller 401(k) Plan shall, to the
extent permitted by Section 401(k)(10) of the Code, make distributions
available to Business Employees, and the Buyer 401(k) Plan shall accept any
such distribution (including loans) as a rollover distribution if so directed
by the Business Employee; provided, that such distribution is in the form of
cash (or a promissory note for a participant 401(k) loan). The Parties agree
to cooperate so as not to place any loan with respect to a Business Employee's
rollover account into default during the period from the Closing Date until
the rollover is completed; provided, that such employee continues making loan
repayments on a timely basis during such period in accordance with the
Seller's established procedures. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Seller
shall cause the accounts of all Business Employees under the Seller 401(k)
Plan to become fully vested.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(j)

  |  

Multiemployer Plans. As of the date hereof, the Business has no obligation to
contribute to any Multiemployer Plans, other than the Multiemployer Plans set
forth on Schedule 6.2(j). The Buyer will contribute to such Multiemployer
Plans on such Union Business Employees' behalf after the Closing solely with
respect to service performed by the Union Business Employees after the Closing
Date in accordance with the collective bargaining Contracts applicable to the
Business in effect from time to time.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(k)

  |  

Flexible Spending Accounts. Effective as of the Closing Date and through at
least the end of the Continuation Period, the Buyer shall establish flexible
spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses, and shall credit
such accounts with the amount credited as of the Closing Date under comparable
accounts maintained under Benefit Plans from the beginning of the plan year to
the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, (i) the
Seller shall pay to the Buyer in cash the amount, if any, by which aggregate
contributions made by Business Employees to the Seller's flexible spending
accounts exceeded the aggregate benefits provided to Business Employees as of
the Closing, or (ii) the Buyer shall pay to the Seller in cash the amount, if
any, by which aggregate benefits provided to Business Employees under the
Seller's flexible spending accounts exceeded the aggregate contributions made
by Business Employees as of the Closing.

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(l)

  |  

Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits. During the Continuation Period, the Buyer
shall provide retiree medical benefits for all Non-Union Business Employees
(and their dependents) who (i) immediately prior to the Closing were eligible
for retiree medical benefits pursuant to any applicable Seller Benefit Plan,
or (ii) on the date of their retirement during the Continuation Period, would
have been eligible for retiree medical benefits pursuant to any applicable
Seller Benefit Plan (as in effect immediately prior to the Closing) had the
Seller not sold the Business. The retiree medical benefits described above
shall be provided in the form of fully retiree-paid coverage that is made
available through the Buyer and is comparable to the benefit available on a
fully retiree-paid basis at the Closing Date had the Seller not sold the
Business.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(m)

  |  

Collective Bargaining Agreements and Employment Agreements. The Buyer agrees
that as of and following the Closing Date, with respect to facilities covered
by collective bargaining agreements that are acquired via the Asset Sale, the
Buyer shall recognize and bargain with the unions that are signatories to such
collective bargaining agreements as the representatives of the employees of
the bargaining units described therein and assume the collective bargaining
agreements listed under Schedule 3.19(a) (for the avoidance of doubt, in each
case solely with respect to the applicable covered Union Business Employees)
to which such unions are signatories.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(n)

  |  

W-2 Matters. Pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-53, the Buyer and the
Seller shall apply the "standard" method for purposes of employee payroll
reporting with respect to Business Employees.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(o)

  |  

WARN and Corresponding State Laws. Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall
make any filings and shall deliver any notices required in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 2101, et seq. ("WARN"), or any state law
requiring advance notice to employees of layoffs, terminations, relocations,
plant closings, or similar events so that neither the Seller nor the Buyer
shall have any Liability under WARN or any such state law as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Buyer shall be primarily responsible for
and agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, at the option of the Seller, to
defend the Seller from and against any Liability, obligation or cost under
WARN or any such state law, with respect to any Business Employee who is found
to have suffered an "employment loss" under WARN after the Closing Date as a
result of Buyer's actions, and any and all other Liabilities, obligations and
costs, including attorneys' fees, arising out of or resulting from Buyer's
actions or inactions or failure to serve sufficient notice pursuant to WARN or
any such state law. The Seller shall be primarily responsible for and agrees
to indemnify, hold harmless and, at the option of the Buyer, to defend the
Buyer from and against any Liability, obligation or cost under WARN or any
such state law, with respect to any Business Employee who is found to have
suffered an "employment loss" under WARN prior to the Closing Date, and any
and all other liabilities, obligations and costs, including attorneys' fees,
arising out of or resulting from Seller's actions or inactions or failure to
serve sufficient notice pursuant to WARN or any such state law. Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate in good faith to coordinate movement of personnel prior
to and following the Closing in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions in order to avoid "employment loss" WARN Liabilities, obligations
or costs.

(p)

  |  

Retention Agreements. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall (or shall cause
its applicable Affiliate to), subject to the terms and conditions of Section
9.2(j), assume all retention agreements in effect immediately prior to the
Closing and listed in Schedule 3.7.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(q)

  |  

No provision of this Section 6.2 shall (i) be construed to establish, amend,
or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract,
policy or arrangement, (ii) limit the ability of the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, any Company or any Subsidiary of
any Company) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, or (iii) create any
third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person (including any
Business Employee) other than the Parties or any right to employment or
continued employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with
the Buyer, any Company, any Subsidiary of any Company, or any of their
respective Affiliates.

6.3 No Access to Insurance Following Closing

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

the Buyer agrees that, except as provided in Sections 6.3(d) and 6.3(f), all
right, title and interest of the Company Group or any Affiliates of any member
thereof in, to and under any insurance policies and self-insurance
arrangements related to periods prior to, after, and through the Closing
(including all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds)
shall, as of the Closing, be deemed Excluded Assets hereunder, and not assets
of the Buyer or the Business, and none of the Buyer or the Business shall have
any rights under any such insurance policies and self-insurance arrangements;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

subject to Sections 6.3(d), 6.3(e) and 6.3(f), the Seller or any of its
Affiliates may, to be effective at the Closing, amend any such insurance
policies in the manner it deems appropriate to give effect to the foregoing;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

the Buyer covenants and agrees, except for the Workers Compensation Policies,
not to seek to assert or to exercise any rights or claims of any member of the
Company Group or the Business under or in respect of any past or current
insurance policy under which any member of the Company Group or Affiliate
thereof or the Business is a named insured;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

the Seller and its Affiliates will keep each of the insurance policies set
forth or required to be set forth on Schedule 3.25, or suitable replacements
therefor, in full force and effect through the Closing. With respect to any
property loss damaging physical assets that, but for such loss, would be an
asset of the Business ("Property Loss"), which Property Loss is incurred
between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to pursue insurance coverage for
such Property Loss, including business interruption coverage for such Property
Loss and shall provide the proceeds actually received as a result of such
claim or claims to the Buyer net of (i) any amount by which the Final Purchase
Price was affected pursuant to the purchase price adjustment procedure in
Section 1.5 as a result of such casualty loss, (ii) any amount compensating
for business interruption for the period prior to the Closing Date and (iii)
any deductibles and self-insurance retentions and any costs or expenses
incurred by the Seller or its Affiliates in pursuing such insurance coverage;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(e)

  |  

following the Closing, the Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates to
not, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise eliminate insurance coverage
under each of the Workers Compensation Policies with respect to acts,
omissions, events or circumstances relating to Transferred Employees that
occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(f)

  |  

notwithstanding Section 6.3(a), with respect to acts, omissions, events or
circumstances relating to Transferred Employees that occurred or existed prior
to the Closing Date, including those occurrences, events, incidents and
accidents that have occurred prior to the Closing Date but are not discovered
until after the Closing Date, that are covered by Workers Compensation
Policies ("Pre-Closing WC Claims"), the Seller hereby authorizes the Buyer to
report Pre-Closing WC Claims directly to the provider of such Workers
Compensation Policies (the "WC Insurer") and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist the Buyer's efforts to obtain the benefit of such insurance
coverage; provided, however, that (x) the Buyer shall keep the Seller
reasonably informed and shall exclusively bear and shall promptly repay or
reimburse the Seller or its Affiliates for the amount of each claim including
any deductibles or self-insured retentions associated with any claims under
the Workers Compensation Policies and shall be liable for and indemnify the
Seller and its Affiliates against all uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or
uncollectible amounts of such claims. The Seller shall, on a quarterly basis,
submit an invoice to the Buyer for any amounts payable to the WC Insurer in
respect of such claims, which the Buyer shall promptly (and in any event
within ten (10) calendar days) reimburse to the Seller.

6.4 Novation of Assigned Government Contracts

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Seller shall prepare
(with the Buyer's assistance, which will include preparation of all
information and documents required of the transferee for such requests), in
accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, 48 C.F.R. Section 42.12, and
any applicable agency regulations or policies, a written request meeting the
requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 42, as reasonably
interpreted by the Responsible Contracting Officer (as such term is defined in
Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 42), which shall be submitted by the
Seller to the Responsible Contracting Officer for each Assigned Government
Contract, for the applicable U.S. Governmental Authority (i) to recognize the
Buyer or its designated Affiliate as the Seller's successor-in-interest to
each Assigned Government Contract with a U.S. Governmental Authority and (ii)
to enter into a novation agreement (a "Novation Agreement"), in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and the Seller, pursuant to
which, subject to the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part
42, all of the Seller's right, title and interest in and to, and all of the
Seller's obligations and liabilities under, such Assigned Government Contract
shall be validly conveyed, transferred and assigned and novated to the Buyer
by all parties thereto. The Seller and the Buyer shall each use reasonable
efforts to obtain all consents, approvals and waivers required for the purpose
of processing, entering into and completing the Novation Agreements with
regard to any such Assigned Government Contracts, including responding to any
requests for information by a U.S. Governmental Authority with regard to such
Novation Agreements.

(b)

  |  

The Parties acknowledge that the transfer or assignment of an Assigned
Government Contract where a U.S. Governmental Authority is a party is subject
to the contracting agency's approval of a Novation Agreement recognizing the
Buyer as the successor-in-interest to the Seller. Unless and until the
contracting agency recognizes the Buyer as the successor-in-interest to the
Seller under any Assigned Government Contract, then the Seller shall, through
a subcontracting arrangement or otherwise, provide to the Buyer all of the
Seller's rights and obligations under such Assigned Government Contract to the
maximum extent permissible under law. In connection therewith, the Buyer shall
perform on behalf of the Seller all of the Seller's obligations and satisfy
all of the Seller's Liabilities under such Assigned Government Contract, and
the Seller shall remit to the Buyer all payments it receives under such
Assigned Government Contract with respect to obligations performed by the
Buyer. The Parties shall take all necessary steps and actions to provide the
Buyer with the benefits of such Assigned Government Contracts, and to relieve
the Seller of the performance and other obligations thereunder, including
entry into subcontracts for the performance thereof. The Buyer agrees to pay,
perform and discharge, and, if the Seller acts with reasonable care in
providing such arrangements and taking such actions, indemnify the Seller
against and hold the Seller harmless from, all obligations and Liabilities of
the Seller arising from such performance or failure to perform under such
Assigned Government Contracts.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

In the event that the Seller shall be unable to make the equitable transfer
described in the preceding paragraphs, or if such attempted transfer of rights
or assumption of Liabilities would give rise to any right of termination, or
would otherwise adversely affect the rights of the Seller or the Buyer under
such Assigned Government Contract, the Seller and the Buyer shall continue to
cooperate and use their reasonable efforts to provide the Buyer with all
rights and obligations under such Assigned Government Contracts. To the extent
that any such consents, novations and waivers are not obtained, or until the
impediments to such assignment or novation are resolved, the Seller shall use
its reasonable efforts to (i) provide to the Buyer, at the request of the
Buyer, the benefits of any such Assigned Government Contract to the extent
related to the Business, (ii) cooperate in any lawful arrangement designed to
provide such benefits to the Buyer and (iii) enforce, at the request of and
for the account of the Buyer, any rights of the Seller arising from any such
Assigned Government Contract against any third party (including any
Governmental Authority), including the right to elect to terminate in
accordance with the terms thereof upon the advice of the Buyer. To the extent
that the Buyer is provided the benefits of any Assigned Government Contract
referred to herein (whether from the Seller or otherwise), the Buyer shall
perform on behalf of the Seller and for the benefit of any third party
(including any Governmental Authority) the Liabilities and obligations of the
Seller thereunder or in connection therewith, and the Buyer agrees to pay,
perform and discharge, and, if the Seller acts with reasonable care in
providing such arrangements and taking such actions, indemnify the Seller
against and hold the Seller harmless from, all obligations and Liabilities of
the Seller arising from such performance or failure to perform, and in the
event of a failure of such indemnity, the Seller shall cease to be obligated
under this Agreement in respect of the Assigned Government Contract which is
the subject of such failure.

(d)

  |  

The Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to negotiate any
exceptions to subparagraph (b)(1) of the standard form novation agreement in
FAR 42.1204 permitting the Seller to pursue in its own name specific claims
that the Seller may have directly against any U.S. Governmental Authority,
including but not limited to any payment or adjustment that may be due from
the Government under the provisions of CAS 413.50(c)(12). The Seller shall be
entitled to any payment or other reimbursement due with respect to any pre-
Closing periods from any U.S. Governmental Authority pursuant to FAR Part 31
and applicable Cost Accounting Standards and related regulations, and, in the
event that the Buyer or any Company receives any such payment or other
reimbursement, it shall promptly pay such amount to the Seller. The Buyer also
agrees that, to the extent necessary to permit the Seller to prosecute claims
against U.S. Governmental Authority that are assigned to or retained by the
Seller under the terms of this Agreement or to defend against any claims by
U.S. Governmental Authorities that assigned to or retained by the Seller under
the terms of this Agreement, the Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to
negotiate and enter into a claim sponsorship agreement that will permit the
Seller to prosecute or defend any such claim in the name of the Buyer, on
reasonable terms and conditions that require the Seller to bear all costs and
Liabilities in connection with any such sponsored claim.

(e)

The Seller and Buyer shall, and shall procure that their respective Affiliates
shall, cooperate in good faith and provide reasonable assistance and support
requested by the other Party in claiming reimbursement from, or disputing or
defending against claims by, any Governmental Authority under applicable Cost
Accounting Standards, by Federal Acquisition Regulations, and related
regulations or contractual requirements ("Cost Accounting Proceedings"),
including by (i) taking such actions as the other Party may reasonably request
to avoid, dispute, deny, defend, resist, appeal, compromise or contest
(including making counterclaims) all or any proceedings which comprise the
Cost Accounting Proceedings, subject to the assisting Party being paid all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by it in complying with the requesting
Party's requests; and provided, that the assisting Party and its Affiliates
shall not be required to agree to incur any liabilities, obligations or
restrictions which restrict or impair the operation of its business; (ii)
ensuring that no admissions in relation to the Cost Accounting Proceedings are
made by or on behalf of the assisting Party or its Affiliates; and (iii)
giving or procuring to be given by the assisting Party and its relevant
Affiliates all such information and assistance, including access to premises
and personnel, and the right to examine and copy or photograph any assets,
accounts, documents and records, in each case during normal business hours
upon reasonable advance notice, as the requesting Party may reasonably request
in connection with the Cost Accounting Proceeding; provided, that the Buyer
shall not be required to provide such information and assistance to the extent
that it unreasonably interferes with the ongoing operations of the Business or
to the extent such disclosure is legally restricted.

  |  

(i)

Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, services or transactions
(including, income, sales, use, transfer, withholding, payroll and other
employment Taxes) of the Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date. The amount of any other Taxes of the Companies
for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable
period up to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the total number of days in such Straddle Period.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |

notwithstanding the foregoing clause (1) or any other provision of this
Agreement, all transactions not in the Ordinary Course occurring on the
Closing Date after the Closing or that are otherwise properly allocable to the
portion of the Closing Date after the Closing, shall be treated as having
occurred as of the beginning of the day immediately following the Closing Date
and shall be reported on the Buyer's U.S. federal income Tax Return or the
Company's Tax Return (as the case may be) to the extent permitted or required
by Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) and shall similarly be
reported on other Tax Returns of the Buyer, the Companies and their Affiliates
to the extent permitted by Requirements of Law.

  |  

(iii)

  |

be reflected on such Tax Return. The Buyer shall, in preparing such Tax
Return, cause the items for which the Seller may be liable hereunder to be
reflected in accordance with the Seller's instructions (except to the extent
that, in the opinion of Tax counsel to the Buyer (which opinion and which Tax
counsel are reasonably acceptable to Seller (it being understood that
Sheppard, Mullin, Richter and Hampton, LLP is reasonably acceptable Tax
counsel), the cost of which opinion shall be borne 50% by the Buyer and 50% by
the Seller, there is no substantial authority for revising such Tax Return in
accordance with the Seller's instructions) and, in the absence of receiving
such instructions, in accordance with the Seller's past practice, if any, to
the extent permissible under Requirements of Law.

with respect to which the Seller may incur indemnification liability under
this Agreement (a "Tax Proceeding"), the Buyer shall promptly notify the
Seller of the Tax Proceeding in writing and in any event within ten days after
receiving the notice of the Tax Proceeding. The Seller shall have the right to
represent the interests of any Company or the Business or the Assets in any
Tax Proceeding and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. The Buyer

expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall not be entitled to
settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any
claim for Taxes without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent

anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Buyer, the Companies,
or any Affiliate of the foregoing shall (i) be entitled to participate in any
Tax Proceeding with respect to a consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary
Tax Return which includes any member of the Seller consolidated group; or (ii)

other similar Taxes that are payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne 50% by the Buyer and 50% by the

and 6.17. The party required by applicable Law to file any Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to any such Taxes shall prepare and file such
Tax Returns and the Buyer and the Seller shall each, and shall each cause its
Affiliates to, cooperate in the timely preparation and filing of, and join in
the execution of, any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The Buyer and
the Seller agree to make reasonable efforts to mitigate, reduce or eliminate

similar agreements between the Seller or any of the Seller's Affiliates, on
the one hand, and any of the Companies, on the other hand, shall be terminated
with respect to the Companies prior to the Closing Date, and, after the

Tax Elections. The Seller and the Buyer shall, or shall cause their relevant

state or local Tax law) with respect to the acquisition of the Section
338(h)(10) Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Elections").
Subject to Section 1.6, the Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate in the
preparation of all forms, attachments and schedules necessary to effectuate
the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, including IRS Forms 8023 and 8883 and any

Forms without the prior written consent of the Seller or the Buyer, as the
case may be. The Seller and the Buyer shall and shall cause their Affiliates
to (i) file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections and (ii) take no position contrary thereto in connection with any
Tax Proceeding or otherwise, in each case, except to the extent required
otherwise pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)

at the Closing one or more duly executed IRS Forms 8023 that reflect the

  |  

(i)

  |  

Neither the Buyer nor any Affiliate of the Buyer shall (or shall cause or
permit any of the Companies to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax
Return relating in whole or in part to any of the Companies with respect to
any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date (or with
respect to any Straddle Period) without the prior written consent of the
Seller, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the Seller.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

Neither the Buyer nor any Affiliate of the Buyer shall (or shall cause or
permit any of the Companies to) carryback for United States or non-United
States federal, national, state or local Tax purposes to any taxable period,
or portion thereof, of any of the Companies or the Seller or any Affiliate of
the Seller ending before, or which includes, the Closing Date, any operating
losses, net operating losses, capital losses, tax credits or similar items
arising in, resulting from, or generated in connection with a taxable year of
the Buyer, a Company, or any Affiliate of the Buyer, or portion thereof,
ending on or after the Closing Date.

Any refunds of Taxes of a Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for
the account of the Seller and shall be paid by the Buyer or the Companies to
the Seller within five days of receipt of any such refund less any Taxes
imposed on the relevant Company as a result of the receipt of such refund;
provided, however, that the Buyer or the Companies shall be liable only to the
extent that such Tax refund was not reflected on the Final Closing Date
Statement. In determining the portion of a Tax refund relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, any refund of Taxes relating to a Straddle Period shall be
equitably apportioned between the portion of such period ending on the Closing
Date and the portion of such taxable period beginning on the day after the
Closing Date.

(k)

Property Taxes Imposed on Assets. Real and personal property Taxes imposed
upon any of the Assets for a Straddle Period (a "Straddle Period Property
Tax") shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion
of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Tax
Period"). The portion of any Straddle Period Property Tax relating to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the relevant taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the relevant taxable
period. The portion of any Straddle Period Property Tax relating to the Post-
Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period minus the amount of such Tax relating to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period, as determined pursuant to the preceding sentence. The Seller shall be
liable for, and shall indemnify the Buyer against, all Straddle Period
Property Taxes relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided, however, the
Seller shall be liable only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the amount,
if any, reserved for such Taxes on the final Closing Date Statement and taken
into account in determining the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.5.
The Buyer shall be liable for, and shall indemnify the Seller against, all
Straddle Period Property Taxes relating to the Post-Closing Tax Period. The
party required by law to pay any Straddle Period Property Tax (the "Paying
Party") shall file the Tax Return related to such Straddle Period Property Tax
within the time period prescribed by Law and shall timely pay such Straddle
Period Property Tax in full. To the extent any such payment exceeds the
liability of the Paying Party for the Straddle Period Property Tax as
determined pursuant to this Section 6.12(k), the Paying Party shall provide
the other Party (the "Non-Paying Party") with written notice of payment of the
Straddle Period Property Tax, and within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of
such written notice of payment, the Non-Paying Party shall reimburse the
Paying Party for the Non-Paying Party's share of the paid Straddle Period
Taxes, as determined pursuant to this Section 6.12(k).

(l)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
indemnification obligations contained in this Section 6.12 shall survive the
Closing Date until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) the Parties'
indemnification obligations under Section 6.12 shall not be affected by any
provision of Section 9.6(a) other than Section 9.6(a)(vi) and (b) to the
extent that a Buyer Group Member shall be entitled to indemnification for any
Taxes pursuant to more than one provision contained in this Agreement
(including Section 6.12(a) and Section 9.2), in no event shall Seller be
required to indemnify such Buyer Group Member for such Taxes more than once.

6.13 Export Control Authorizations

  

  

The Parties acknowledge that the Seller currently possesses the Export Control
Authorizations set forth on Schedule 6.13 that are necessary for the lawful
operation of the Business and that these, and possibly additional, Export
Control Authorizations will be required by the Buyer to lawfully operate the
Business after the Closing. The Buyer and the Seller shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to amend or transfer to the Buyer
any existing Export Control Authorizations, or allow the Buyer to obtain any
new Export Control Authorizations, needed to operate the Business after the
Closing, but in no event shall the Buyer be permitted to operate under the
Seller's Export Control Authorizations to the extent such Export Control
Authorizations have not been transferred to the Buyer or the Buyer has not
obtained new Export Control Authorizations.

  

  

6.14 Directorate of Defense Trade Controls Notifications

  

  

The Seller shall notify the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls not less
than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing. Both Parties shall submit the
necessary "Material Change Notification" to the Directorate of Defense Trade
Controls within five (5) days of the Closing as required pursuant to
International Traffic in Arms Regulations § 122.4(a). The Buyer shall submit
the necessary request to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to amend
Export Control Authorizations within sixty (60) days of receiving the
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls' acknowledgement of its "Material Change
Notification."

  


 

  

6.15 No Solicitation

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

From the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10, or the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause each Seller Group Member to, cease any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any person other
than the Buyer with respect to, and to deal exclusively with the Buyer and its
designated Affiliates and representatives regarding, any and all acquisitions
of all or a majority of the Business (other than sales in the Ordinary Course,
and excluding the Excluded Assets, Excluded PWR Assets and Excluded
Liabilities) or any equity interests of the Companies, whether by way of
merger, consolidation or other business combination with any other Person,
purchase or exchange of equity interests, purchase of assets or otherwise (an
"Alternative Transaction") and, without the prior consent of the Buyer, the
Seller shall not, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the other
Seller Group Members not to (directly or indirectly) (i) solicit, initiate or
otherwise engage in any negotiations, discussions or other communications with
any other Person relating to any Alternative Transaction, (ii) provide or
furnish information or documentation to any other Person with respect to the
Business in respect of any Alternative Transaction, or (iii) enter into any
Contract with any other Person in respect of any Alternative Transaction.

current basis, regarding any such matters.

(a)

  |  

With respect to the Carlstadt Facility and the Transactions, the Seller shall,
before the Closing Date, retain an LSRP and either (i) achieve Compliance with
ISRA; or (ii) submit to the NJDEP an ISRA remediation certification, with
respect to the Carlstadt Facility and the Transactions related to the
Carlstadt Facility. Arde and the Seller shall be designated as the responsible
parties under such Remediation Certification, with the Seller being designated
as the Lead Party. In the event the Seller or Arde does not achieve Compliance
with ISRA with respect to the Carlstadt Facility before the Closing Date, the
Seller shall, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Section 6.16 and
Section 9.7, take all actions necessary to achieve Compliance with ISRA after
the Closing Date. If required in connection with the submission of the
Remediation Certification, the Seller shall, on or before the Closing Date,
obtain and post or execute, and from and after the Closing Date maintain at
the Seller's sole cost and expense in full force and effect until released by
the NJDEP, a remediation funding source (as such term is defined under ISRA)
required under such Remediation Certification to secure the performance of
Arde's and the Seller's ISRA compliance obligations with respect to the
Carlstadt Facility. Any such remediation funding source shall be satisfactory
in form and substance to the NJDEP.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

The Seller shall pay and be responsible for all ISRA Compliance Costs incurred
in connection with Arde's and the Seller's obligation to achieve Compliance
with ISRA.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

In the event the Seller is required to perform any Remedial Actions at the
Carlstadt Facility following the Closing Date in order to achieve Compliance
with ISRA, the Seller agrees to perform such Remedial Actions in accordance
with the provisions of Section 9.7, Seller's rights, obligations and
responsibilities of the "Lead Party" under Section 9.7(e), and the Access
Agreement. Without limiting or affecting the applicable provisions of Section
9.7 or the Access Agreement, but by way of supplementation thereto solely with
respect to the Seller's ISRA compliance at the Carlstadt Facility, the Seller
agrees to:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

perform, and cause all consultants and contractors, including its LSRP, to
perform, such Remedial Actions in a workmanlike manner and consistent with
applicable Environmental Laws;

promptly provide the Buyer and Arde with copies of all documents related to
the Seller's actions to achieve Compliance with ISRA in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Section 9.7(d), including copies of such documents
deemed to be final by its LSRP, but not intended to be submitted or certified
to the NJDEP by its LSRP until a later date as required under ISRA or the
SRRA.

6.17 HSR Transfers and License

  

  

  

Prior to the Closing, HSSSI and HSC shall transfer (a) to PWR (i) all of their
assets owned or held for use by HSR, all of which assets are manufactured or
sold at or from the Canoga Park Facility, including the assets identified on
Schedule 6.17(a)(i) (other than the know-how and copyrights owned by HSC that
are to be licensed to PWR as contemplated by the following sentence) (the "HSR
Assets") and (ii) all of their Liabilities relating to the HSR Assets,
including the Liabilities identified on Schedule 6.17(a)(ii) (the "HSR
Liabilities"), which shall have been assumed by PWR and (b) to PWR, all of the
employees employed by HSR identified on Schedule 6.17(b), and in each case
shall have taken all actions that are necessary to carry out the foregoing
transfers. In addition, prior to the Closing, HSC shall grant to PWR a non-
exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, paid-up license to all of the know-how and
copyrights that are owned by HSC and that have been used primarily in
connection with the HSR Assets in the three (3) year period immediately
preceding the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the HSR
Assets and HSR Liabilities shall not include assets of HSSSI or HSC of the
type, kind or character described in Section 1.1(b) and liabilities of HSSSI

PWRWB Facility, and (b) the Parties shall cooperate in good faith and use
reasonable best efforts to finalize the schedules to the Transition Services
Agreement, the Long-Term Services Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements
and related documentation (but, for the avoidance of doubt, in the absence of
agreement between the Parties on any finalization changes, the Parties shall,
or shall procure that at the Closing their relevant Subsidiaries shall,
execute such agreements in the forms attached as exhibits hereto).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the total
amount payable in the first year following the Closing in respect of Costs of
Service for services provided by the Seller to PWR under the Transition
Services Agreement and the Long-Term Services Agreement, together with the
total amount of Rent payable in respect of such period by PWR to the Seller

to the Closing Date, no Company shall enter into, modify, terminate or

shall take such actions as the Seller may reasonably request to avoid,

each case during normal business hours, as the Seller may reasonably request
in connection with the Retained Litigation; provided, that the Buyer shall not
be required to provide such information and assistance to the extent that it
unreasonably interferes with the ongoing operations of the Business or to the
extent such disclosure is legally restricted.

The Buyer shall procure that any amounts recovered by any Company (whether by

The Parties agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set out in Exhibit
M.

  


 

  

6.21 Hypersonics Right of First Refusal

  

  

If, at any time within five (5) years of the Closing Date, the Seller or its
Affiliates (or the United Technologies Research Center of the Seller) decides
to enter into a sale, partnership, co-development, teaming, license or similar
transaction with a Third Party (but excluding Goodrich Corporation and its
controlled Affiliates for purposes of this Section 6.21) primarily in order to
commercialize any Research Field IP (a "Commercialization"), the Seller shall
deliver a written notice (the "ROFR Notice") to the Buyer setting out in
reasonable detail the consideration that it intends to receive with respect to
such Commercialization and the other material terms and conditions of such
Commercialization. The Buyer may elect to enter into such Commercialization on
the terms specified in the ROFR Notice by delivering a written election notice
to the Seller within 20 Business Days following its receipt of the ROFR
Notice. Any such election by the Buyer shall be an irrevocable commitment by
the Buyer to enter into such Commercialization on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the ROFR Notice. In the event that the Buyer does not timely
elect to exercise its right to enter into such Commercialization, then the
Seller may enter into the Commercialization on terms and conditions that are
no more favorable to such Third Party than those specified in the ROFR Notice
unless the Seller affords the Buyer a new right of first refusal pursuant to
the procedure set out in this Section 6.21; provided, that if the
Commercialization with such Third Party is not entered into within six months
of the ROFR Notice, then prior to entering into a Commercialization during the
aforementioned five (5) year term, the Seller must provide to Buyer a new
right of first refusal pursuant to the procedure set out in this Section 6.21.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer may not
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this Section 6.21 without
the prior written consent of the Seller, and in the event of any direct or
indirect change of control of the Buyer, all of the Seller's obligations under
this Section 6.21 shall terminate in their entirety, unless the Seller has
provided its prior written consent to such change of control. For purposes of
this Section 6.21, a "change of control" of the Buyer shall be deemed to occur
if (a) any Person or group of persons (other than an Affiliate or Affiliates
of the Buyer) becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of fifty
percent (50%) or more of the outstanding equity interests or voting power of
the Buyer.

  |  

The representations and warranties of the Seller contained in this Agreement

warranties made pursuant to Sections 3.5 (Sufficiency of Assets; Good Title)
and 3.8 (Taxes) shall survive until thirty (30) days after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (or, if no statute of limitations is
applicable, the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date); and (iii) the
representations and warranties made pursuant to Sections 3.17 (ERISA) and 3.18
(Environmental Matters) shall survive the Closing until twenty-four (24)

(c)

  |  

No covenant or agreement contained herein that is to be performed on or prior
to the Closing Date shall survive the Closing Date unless otherwise expressly
agreed by the Parties; provided, however, that the foregoing shall in no
respect limit the rights of the Parties to seek indemnification for any breach
of such covenant or agreement occurring before the Closing. Any covenant and
agreement to be performed, in whole or in part, after the Closing Date shall
survive the Closing indefinitely, except as otherwise expressly provided in
such covenant or agreement. The Parties specifically and unambiguously intend
that the survival periods that are set forth in this Section for the
representations and warranties contained herein shall replace any statute of
limitations for such representations or warranties that would otherwise be
applicable (including, without limitation, the statute of limitations
prescribed by Requirements of Law). The limitations on survival periods set
forth in this Section 9.1 shall not apply in the case of fraud by the
Indemnitor.

(d)

periods set forth in Sections 9.1(a) and 9.1(b) shall survive until such claim
is finally and fully resolved. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.1 to
the contrary, in no event shall the survival of any representation or warranty
hereunder be affected by any investigation, inquiry or examination made for or
on behalf of any party, or the knowledge of any party's representatives or the
acceptance by any party of any certificate or opinion hereunder or the
consummation of the Closing.

   
---|---

  |  

Any Buyer Group Member or Seller Group Member seeking indemnification
hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") shall give promptly to the party obligated
to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the "Indemnitor") a
written notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to the claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include in
such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of computation of
the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement
or any other agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in
connection herewith upon which such claim is based; provided, however, that
the failure of any Indemnified Party to give the Claim Notice promptly as
required by this Section 9.4(a) shall not affect such Indemnified Party's
rights under this Section 9.4(a), except to the extent that such failure is
actually prejudicial to the rights and obligations of the Indemnitor.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
Section 9 shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of
any court of competent jurisdiction in an action between the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnitor; or (iii) by any other means to which the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be
deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no
appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally
determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in
establishing the amount of Losses suffered by it. All amounts due to the
Indemnified Party as so finally determined shall be paid by wire transfer
within thirty (30) days after such final determination.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

9.5 Third Party Claims

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

In order for a party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under
this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a Third Party Claim
against the Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Party Claim
promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnified
Party to give notice promptly as required by this Section 9.5(a) shall not
affect such Indemnified Party's rights under this Section 9 except to the
extent such failure is actually prejudicial to the rights and obligations of
the Indemnitor. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, within five (5) days after the Indemnified Party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, should a party be physically served with a complaint with
regard to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnitor with a copy of the complaint within five (5) days after receipt
thereof and shall deliver to the Indemnitor within seven (7) days after the
receipt of such complaint copies of notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim
(or in each case such earlier time as may be necessary to enable the
Indemnitor to respond to the court proceedings on a timely basis); provided,
however, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice and provide
documents within the time periods required by this Section 9.5(a) shall not
affect such Indemnified Party's rights under this Section 9 except to the
extent such failure is actually prejudicial to the rights and obligations of
the Indemnitor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.5 shall not apply
with respect to any legal proceedings relating to Taxes, which shall be
governed by Section 6.12(f).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

In the event of the initiation of any legal proceeding against the Indemnified
Party by a third Person, the Indemnitor shall, subject to the conditions and
exceptions set forth below, have the sole and absolute right after the receipt
of notice, at its option and at its own expense, to be represented by counsel
of its choice and to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any loss,
liability or damage indemnified against hereunder; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its
choice and at its expense. The Parties agree to reasonably cooperate with each
other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such
legal proceeding, claim or demand. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to
defend such proceeding, claim or demand within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of written notice thereof pursuant to Section 9.5(a) the Indemnified
Party may defend against or otherwise deal with any such proceeding, claim or
demand and may retain counsel, all at the expense of the Indemnitor, and
control the defense of such proceeding. Neither the Indemnitor nor the
Indemnified Party may settle any such proceeding without the consent of the
other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, unless (x) the
claimant and the Indemnitor provide to the Indemnified Party an unqualified
release from all liability in respect of such proceeding and (y) such
settlement does not provide for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief
restricting or obligating the Indemnified Party. After any final judgment or
award shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration board or administrative
agency of competent jurisdiction and the time in which to appeal therefrom has
expired, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding agreement with respect
to each separate matter alleged to be indemnifiable by the Indemnitor
hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnitor notice of any
sums due and owing by it with respect to such matter and the Indemnitor shall
pay all of the sums so owing to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer within
thirty (30) days after the date of such notice.

9.7 Environmental Matters

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

The following provisions of this Section 9.7 shall govern the Seller's and the
Buyer's investigations, remediations and indemnification obligations relating
to Environmental Liabilities for Remedial Actions.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

The Seller's Remedial Action obligations are subject to the following
standards and limitations:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

Pursuant to its indemnity obligations under Section 9.2(d) and the provisions
of Section 9.7(e), Seller shall be the Lead Party for and shall perform all
Remedial Actions Required by Law for all Preexisting Environmental Conditions
and all Seller New Environmental Conditions. Where the Seller is the Lead
Party, the Seller shall have the right, after reasonably consulting with the
Buyer, to select and utilize, to the maximum extent allowable under applicable
Environmental Laws, institutional and engineering controls, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.7(b)(iv).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

With respect to any Environmental Condition for which the Seller is
responsible, the Seller shall only be obligated to conduct, or provide
indemnification for, Remedial Actions Required by Law that are conducted in a
reasonably cost-effective manner acceptable to or approved by the applicable
Governmental Authorities (considering initial capital costs, the present
discounted value of anticipated future monitoring, operation and maintenance
costs, and any costs associated with disruption of operations at the affected
property), to achieve the Applicable Remediation Standards. The Seller shall
seek, to the extent practicable, a no further action letter or similar
document from the applicable Governmental Authority confirming that no further
Remedial Action (other than maintenance and monitoring of institutional and
engineering controls meeting the requirements of Section 9.7(b)(iv)) are
required with respect to such Environmental Condition.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

90  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

  |  

(iii)

  |  

If the Seller reasonably believes that the action of a Governmental Authority
in imposing Applicable Remediation Standards or in requiring particular
Remedial Action methods is contrary to law or unreasonable under the
circumstances, and the Seller determines in its reasonable business judgment
that the most cost-effective approach is to challenge such action through
appropriate regulatory and/or judicial processes, the Seller reserves the
right to undertake such challenge. The Seller shall have the right to control
such legal or regulatory challenge, and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate
with the Seller with respect to such challenge; provided, that (i) Seller's
obligation to indemnify the Buyer shall extend to and include the obligation
to indemnify Buyer for Losses caused by the Seller's decision to exercise any
such legal challenges; and (ii) during the pendency of such challenge the
Seller shall take such actions which are required by law or reasonable under
the circumstances.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iv)

  |  

In addition to the Environmental Restrictions, the Seller shall have the right
to propose and utilize institutional and engineering controls, subject to the
following:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

The Seller shall have the right to utilize institutional and engineering
controls at the Canoga Park Leased Premises and PWRWB Leased Premises as
provided in the Canoga Park Lease and the PWRWB Lease, respectively.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

The Seller shall have the right, subject to approval of the applicable
Governmental Authority, to propose and utilize institutional controls
restricting future use of the Leased Real Property to industrial or commercial
purposes and prohibiting withdrawal of groundwater; provided that such
institutional controls would not unreasonably interfere with the continued
(including the anticipated future) operation of the Business or would not
subject the Buyer to any Material Unreimbursed Implementation Cost.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(C)

  |  

The Seller shall have the right, subject to approval of the applicable
Governmental Authority, to propose and accept engineering controls (e.g.,
capping or covering areas) on the Leased Real Property; provided that such
engineering controls would not unreasonably interfere with the continued
(including the anticipated future) operation of the Business or would not
subject the Buyer to any Material Unreimbursed Implementation Cost.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

91  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

  |  

(D)

  |  

The Seller shall have the right to propose engineering controls on the Owned
Real Property in addition to those engineering controls referenced in the
Environmental Restrictions set forth in Section 6.10 subject to the Buyer's
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided that such additional engineering controls shall not
unreasonably interfere with the continued (including the anticipated future)
operation of the Business or the anticipated future industrial or commercial
use of the Owned Real Property or would not subject the Buyer to any Material
Unreimbursed Implementation Cost.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(E)

  |  

If the Seller elects to utilize engineering and/or institutional controls as
provided in Section 9.7(c)(iv), the Buyer agrees to cooperate in executing and
recording any documents that are necessary to establish and implement such
institutional and engineering controls ("Environmental Covenants").

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(v)

  |  

If the Buyer undertakes any construction, expansion, demolition or renovation
activities on the Owned Real Property, Leased Real Property, the Canoga Park
Leased Premises or the PWRWB Leased Premises (to the extent permitted under
the Canoga Park Lease or the PWRWB Lease) that are not required by applicable
Environmental Law or ordered, directed or otherwise formally requested by a
Governmental Authority, and that involve the demolition or renovation of any
structures, the removal of any slab, paved area, parking lot or engineering
control cap (collectively, "Cap") or the excavation of soils beneath any such
Cap, the Buyer shall be solely responsible for all costs associated with such
work, including (1) any costs of construction, expansion, demolition,
renovation and excavation; (2) any costs of identification, management and
removal of Regulated Asbestos Containing Materials; (3) any costs of the
management and disposition of waste materials related to the construction,
demolition or renovation of such structures; (4) any costs of excavation or
disposal of disturbed or excavated in the process of conducting such work; and
(5) the costs of replacing any engineering control cap to the extent required
under applicable Environmental Law or any Environmental Covenants; and the
Seller shall have no indemnification obligations under Section 9.2(d) with
respect to any such costs; provided that nothing in this paragraph shall
relieve Seller from its indemnification obligations under Section 9.2(d) with
respect to any storage tanks, drums, waste units, barrels, containers, or
other closed receptacles previously undisclosed to the Buyer.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(vi)

  |  

Upon the Seller providing to the Buyer evidence of the LA Regional Board's
issuance of a no further action letter with respect to Environmental
Conditions at the Owned Real Property, the Seller's indemnification
obligations under Section 9.2(d) (relating to Remedial Actions to the
Applicable Remediation Standard) with respect to such Environmental Conditions
on, at or affecting the Owned Real Property shall terminate, and the Buyer
shall assume responsibility for such Environmental Conditions at the Owned
Real Property. However, in the event the LA Regional Board reopens site
investigation or other Remedial Actions Required by Law due to changes in
legal standards applicable to Preexisting Environmental Conditions or Seller
New Environmental Conditions, then Seller shall resume Lead Party
responsibility with respect to such Remedial Actions Required by Law.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

92  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

If it is determined that an Environmental Condition that requires Remedial
Action is the result of a Buyer New Environmental Condition in combination
with either a Preexisting Environmental Condition or a Seller New
Environmental Condition, liability for any Remedial Action shall be allocated
equitably between the Seller and the Buyer based on consideration of (among
others) the following factors:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

whether, but for the Environmental Condition for which one of the Parties is
solely responsible, a Remedial Action obligation would have arisen for the
other Party;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

the relative quantity, toxicity and area affected by the Regulated Substances
for which the respective Parties are responsible;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iii)

  |  

the degree to which the Regulated Substance for which a Party is responsible
affects the selection of the remedy, the cost of the remedy, and the period of
time over which the remedy must be implemented; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iv)

  |  

other relevant considerations.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

The Parties agree that the following presumptions will be used in determining
whether an Environmental Condition discovered on the Owned Real Property or
the Leased Real Property after the Closing Date is a Preexisting Environmental
Condition, a Seller New Environmental Condition or a Buyer New Environmental
Condition:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

If the Environmental Condition involves a Regulated Substance that was not
used, generated or stored by the Buyer (including any prior owner or
Predecessor), and is not a decomposition product of a substance used,
generated, or stored by the Buyer, it shall be presumed that the Environmental
Condition is a Preexisting Environmental Condition.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

If the Environmental Condition involves a Regulated Substance that was used,
generated or stored by the Buyer, or is a decomposition product of a substance
used, generated or stored by the Buyer, and such Regulated Substance was not
used, generated or stored by the Seller (including any prior owner or
Predecessor) then, it shall be presumed that the Environmental Condition is a
Buyer New Environmental Condition.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iii)

  |  

If the Environmental Condition involves a Regulated Substance that was used,
generated or stored by both the Seller (including any prior owner or
Predecessor) and the Buyer, or is a decomposition product of such a substance,
and if an Environmental Condition Assessment has been conducted with respect
to the subject property either before the Closing or within three (3) months
after the Closing, then:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

93  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

the concentrations and areas affected by the Regulated Substance as identified
in the Environmental Condition Assessment shall be presumed to be Preexisting
Environmental Conditions in the absence of evidence that such Environmental
Condition resulted from a Release of the Regulated Substance by the Buyer;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

an Environmental Condition found after completion of the Environmental
Condition Assessment involving the presence of any Regulated Substance that
was not identified in the Environmental Condition Assessment and is not the
decomposition product of a substance of identified in the Environmental
Condition Assessment, shall be presumed to be a Buyer New Environmental
Condition; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(C)

  |  

an Environmental Condition found after completion of the Environmental
Condition Assessment involving the presence of a Regulated Substance or
breakdown product thereof at a higher concentration or in a different area
than identified in the Environmental Condition Assessment shall be presumed to
be a Buyer New Environmental Condition.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iv)

  |  

If the Environmental Condition involves a Regulated Substance that was used,
generated or stored by both the Seller and the Buyer, or is a decomposition
product of such a substance, but where an environmental assessment has not
been conducted, then no presumptions shall be made.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(v)

  |  

With respect to the Canoga Park Facility, it shall be presumed that any
Environmental Condition found in areas where the Seller conducted operations
prior to the Closing is a Preexisting Environmental Condition unless there has
been a reportable Release of a Regulated Substance by Buyer in such area.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(vi)

  |  

Each presumption set forth in this subsection shall be a rebuttable
presumption. Such presumption shall place the burden of going forward and the
burden or persuasion upon the party against whom the presumption applies. The
presumption may be overcome by a preponderance of the evidence to the
contrary.

   
---|---|---

Property or Leased Real Property.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(C)

  |  

If it is determined that an Environmental Condition on, at or affecting the
Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property is the result of a Buyer New
Environmental Condition in combination with either a Preexisting Environmental
Condition or a Seller New Environmental Condition, the Party with the greater
proportionate responsibility shall be the Lead Party and have the right to
assume control of, direct and implement any Remedial Action, defense or other
response relating to such Environmental Condition.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |

(A)

  |  

The Lead Party shall provide the non-Lead Party for review and comment drafts
of any proposed work plans, reports or other submissions that the Lead Party
intends to deliver or submit to a Governmental Authority prior to said
submission. The non-Lead Party shall have thirty (30) days or such shorter
time as is reasonable to provide comments to the Lead Party regarding any such
draft submissions. Such review shall be at the sole expense of the non-Lead
Party. The Lead Party shall consider and respond to the non-Lead Party's
comments.

to the extent reasonably practicable interference with the non-Lead Party's
business operations at the site in question.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(vi)

  |  

The non-Lead Party agrees to refrain from any ex parte communications with any
involved Governmental Authority or other Person regarding any Remedial Action
being undertaken by the Lead Party or the Environmental Conditions giving rise

  |  

(A)

  |  

The non-Lead Party is required by Law to make a notification to the
Governmental Authority within a time period that does not practicably allow an
opportunity to first notify the Lead Party, provided that the non-Lead Party
shall notify the Lead Party as soon as practicable following the provision of
such notice; or

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

a Governmental Authority conducts an inspection or otherwise initiates a
communication with the non-Lead Party; provided that the non-Lead Party shall
notify the Lead Party as soon as practicable following such communication.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

In communications with any Governmental Authority or other Person regarding
any such Remedial Action or underlying Environmental Condition, the non-Lead
Party or any representatives of the non-Lead Party shall not advocate or take
any action that would hinder, render more difficult, or render more expensive
the Remedial Action to be undertaken by the Lead Party pursuant to the Lead

  |  

(iii)

  |  

The Buyer's obligations under this Section 9.7(f) with respect to the Owned

Each of the Parties agrees to take reasonable steps to mitigate its respective
Losses upon and after becoming aware of any Losses that are indemnifiable
hereunder; provided that any fees, costs and expenses incurred as a result of

pursuant to this Section 9, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the extent

L,Sections I(1), I(2), I(6) and II(1) of Exhibit I and Section 1 of Exhibit M,
in each case with respect to the matters covered therein, shall be the
exclusive remedy for breaches of this Agreement (including any covenant,
obligation, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) or otherwise in respect of
the sale of the Assets and the Shares contemplated hereby, except as provided
in Section 9.10(b).

(b)

  |  

The Buyer, for itself and on behalf of each Buyer Group Member, and their
respective successors and assigns:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

does hereby release, hold harmless and forever discharge the Seller from any
and all Environmental Liabilities of any kind or character, whether known or
unknown, except for those obligations that are set forth in this Agreement;
and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

waives any and all rights and benefits with respect to any claims for
Environmental Liabilities (except for claims for breach of Seller's
obligations that are set forth in this Agreement) that it now has, or in the
future may have conferred upon it, by virtue of any statute or common law
principle that provides that a general release does not extend to claims which
a party does not know or suspect to exist in its favor at the time of
executing the release. The Buyer acknowledges that it is aware that factual
matters known or unknown to it may have given or may hereafter give rise to
environmental claims that are currently unknown, unanticipated and
unsuspected, and it further agrees that this release has been negotiated and
agreed upon in light of that awareness and nevertheless hereby intends to
release the Seller from such Environmental Liabilities in the manner
contemplated by this Section 9.10(b).

  |  

By the mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Seller;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

By the Buyer in the event of any material breach by the Seller of any of the
Seller's agreements, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein
that would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7 to not be

---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

By the Seller in the event of any material breach by the Buyer of any of the
Buyer's agreements, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein
that would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 8 to not be
satisfied, and such breach or noncompliance is incapable of being cured by the
Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within

---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

98  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(d)

  |

to its right under Section 5.2(f) not to appeal, vacate, lift, reverse or
overturn such Court Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, or (y)
such an effort by Buyer is not successful or incapable of being successful by
the Outside Date to vacate, lift, reverse or overturn the Court Order;
provided, however, that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 10.1(d) shall have used all reasonable best efforts to obtain
such permit, authorization, consent, approval, expiration or termination, or
to prevent the entry of such permanent injunction or other Court Order as
applicable, in each case, to the extent required by and subject to Section
5.2;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(e)

and the waiting period thereunder has commenced; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(e) shall not be
available more than sixty (60) days after the expiration of such one hundred
eighty (180)-day period; and provided, further, that the Seller shall not be
entitled to terminate under this Section 10.1(e) if its failure to fulfill its
obligations under Section 5.2 shall have been the cause of, or shall have
resulted in, the failure of the condition set forth in Section 8.2 to be
satisfied within such one hundred eighty (180) day period; or

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(f)

  |  

By the Buyer or the Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of this Agreement (the
"Outside Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 10.1(f) shall not be available to any party whose failure
to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement shall have been the cause of,
or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur prior to the
Outside Date.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

10.2 Notice of Termination

  

  

Any Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 shall
give written notice of such termination to the other Party specifying the
subsection of Section 10.1 pursuant to which the termination is being
effected.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

99  

  

 

 

 

  

  

10.3 Effect of Termination

  

  

In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 10 all
further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement (other than Sections
5.5, 10.4, 11.2 and 11.11) shall be terminated without further liability of
any Party to the other; provided, however, that the termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve any Party from liability for its willful and
intentional breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

  

  

10.4 Termination Fee

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

If this Agreement is terminated, or if terminated pursuant to another
provision, was capable of being terminated (i) pursuant to Section 10.1(d)
based upon a Court Order enjoining the consummation of the Transactions under
applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) pursuant to Section 10.1(c) on the basis that
the Buyer has breached (and not cured) its obligations under Section 5.2,
(iii) pursuant to Section 10.1(e) where the Buyer has breached its obligations
under Section 5.2; provided that solely for purposes of this Section
10.4(a)(iii), the Buyer shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
under Section 5.2(e)(ii) if it used reasonable best efforts to comply
therewith, or (iv) pursuant to Section 10.1(f) and at the time of such
termination the conditions set forth in either Sections 7.2 and 8.2 or
Sections 7.4 and 8.5 have not been met, then the Buyer shall pay the Seller an
amount totaling twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) (the "Termination Fee")
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following such
termination of this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Termination Fee has been agreed
upon, after negotiation, as the Parties' reasonable estimate of Seller's
damages that would be caused by a termination of, or failure to close under,
this Agreement as described in Section 10.4(a), and that an award of such
liquidated damages in the amount of the Termination Fee shall be Seller's
exclusive remedy against Buyer and its Affiliates (and any Financing Sources
of the Buyer) for any Losses incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates as a
result of such termination or failure to close. In addition, if the Buyer
fails promptly to pay the amount due to the Seller pursuant to this Section
10.4, it shall also pay (i) interest thereon at the prime rate as published in
The Wall Street Journal plus five percent (5%), plus (ii) any costs and
expenses incurred by the Seller in connection with a legal action to enforce
this Agreement that results in a judgment against or settlement with the Buyer
for such amount.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 10.4 are
an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, the
Parties would not enter into this Agreement. In light of the difficulty of
accurately determining actual losses or damages with respect to the foregoing,
the Parties acknowledge that the Termination Fee, in the circumstances in
which it becomes payable, constitute a reasonable estimate of the Losses that
will be suffered by reason of any termination of this Agreement where the
Termination Fee is payable and constitutes liquidated damages and is not a
penalty; provided, however, that the Termination Fee shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the sum of:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

100  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

the aggregate amount of the Seller's expenses that are reimbursed by the Buyer
under Section 5.2; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

the fees and expenses of the Buyer that are incurred in connection with
litigating with a Governmental Authority following the filing by that
Governmental Authority of a complaint, which is not filed contemporaneously
with a proposed final judgment proposing the resolution of the matter, seeking
to restrain or enjoin the carrying out of this Agreement or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

SECTION 11. GENERAL PROVISIONS

  

  

11.1 Specific Performance

  

  

The Parties agree that irreparable injury, for which monetary damages even if
available will not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event any
provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof, including the failure of any Party to take all actions on its part
required to be taken by it under this Agreement to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that the Parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law prior
to the Closing and remedies set forth in this Agreement after the Closing, and
that they shall not raise any objections to the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the Parties. Each Party hereby consents to the
issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel
performance of such Party's obligations hereunder.

  

  

11.2 Confidential Nature of Information

  

  

Each Party agrees that all documents, materials and other information which it
shall have obtained regarding the other Party or its Affiliates, as the case
may be, in the course of the negotiations leading to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether obtained before or after the date of
this Agreement), the investigation provided for herein and the preparation of
this Agreement and other related documents shall be held in confidence in
accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which
Confidentiality Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference thereto;
provided, however, that this provision shall survive until the later of (i)
the expiration date set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (ii) the
fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of this Agreement.

  

  

11.3 No Public Announcement

  

  

Neither the Buyer nor the Seller shall, without the approval of the other,
make any press release or other public announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that
any such Party or Parties, as the case may be, shall be so obligated by
Requirements of Law, in which case the other Party shall be advised and the
Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable
release or announcement to be issued; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not preclude communications or disclosures necessary to implement the
provisions of this Agreement or to comply with accounting or Securities and
Exchange Commission disclosure obligations or the rules of any stock exchange
or national market system.

expiration of such ten (10) year period, such Party shall, prior to such
disposition, give the other Party a reasonable opportunity, at such other

11.7 Entire Agreement; Amendments

  

  

This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein and the
documents delivered pursuant hereto, including the Ancillary Agreements, and
the Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire understanding of the Parties
with regard to the subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede
all other prior agreements, understandings, term sheets, heads of terms or
letters of intent between or among any of the Parties, both written and oral.
This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a
written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each of the
Parties.

  

  

11.8 Interpretation

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

Titles and headings to articles, sections and subsections herein are inserted
for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

The Schedules referred to herein shall be construed with and as an integral
part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim
herein. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule hereto referenced by a
particular Section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed
with respect to every other Section for which such disclosure is relevant if
the relevance of such disclosure would be reasonably apparent to a reader of
such disclosure. The Schedules are not intended to constitute, and shall not
be construed as, constituting, representations or warranties of the Seller
except as and to the extent provided in this Agreement or to expand the scope
of the representations or warranties of the Seller under the Agreement.
Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
any Schedule hereto is intended to vary the definition of "Material Adverse
Effect" or to be an admission that such item represents a material exception
or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is material or is reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or to imply that such amount, or
higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are
not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such
amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between
the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in any Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise, (i) neither
the specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any
Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items
or matters, are or are not in the Ordinary Course, and (ii) no Party shall use
the mere fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter
in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is
or is not in the Ordinary Course for purposes of this Agreement. The Seller
may, from time to time prior to or at the Closing, by notice in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, supplement, amend or create any Schedule, in
order to add information or correct previously supplied information, and no
such amendment shall be evidence, in and of itself, that the representations
and warranties in the corresponding Section are no longer true and correct in
all material respects. It is specifically agreed that such Schedules may be
amended to add immaterial, as well as material, items thereto. Notwithstanding
any amendment, supplement, creation of or update to any Schedule, no such
supplemental, amended or additional Schedule shall be deemed to cure any
breach of any covenant or breach or inaccuracy of any representation for
purposes of Section 7.1 or 9.2 or for any other purpose, and it is agreed that
the Buyer may elect to take or refrain from taking actions and to receive
indemnification based upon information contained in Schedules attached to this
Agreement at the time of execution hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing
proviso, if the Schedules delivered to the Buyer on the date of this Agreement
are inaccurate or deficient as a result of differences between (i) the
definition of "Business" or "Restricted Products" and (i) the definitions of
those terms as set forth on Exhibit N to this Agreement, respectively, then
any such inaccuracies or deficiencies shall be fully cured, and shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement or any representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein, to the extent that prior to the date that is three
(3) weeks after the date of this Agreement the Seller provides the Buyer with
updated Schedules with revisions to correct such inaccuracies and
deficiencies.

(c)

  |  

For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) words in the singular shall be held to
include the plural and vice versa and words of one gender shall be held to
include the other gender as the context requires, (ii) the terms "hereof,"
"herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import shall be construed to
refer to this Agreement in its entirety and to all of the Schedules and not to
any particular provision, unless otherwise stated, and (iii) the term
"including" shall mean "including without limitation."

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

As used in this Agreement, the term "primarily" when used in phrases such as
"related primarily to," "used primarily in," "held for use primarily in" and
phrases of similar import shall be construed to mean "primarily or
exclusively."

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(e)

  |  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any reference to
the Business in any provision of this Agreement following the Recitals shall
not be deemed to include the Excluded Assets, the Excluded Liabilities, the
Excluded PWR Assets or the RDA Business unless, and then only to the extent
that, the Excluded Assets, the Excluded Liabilities, the Excluded PWR Assets
or the RDA Business, as applicable, are expressly included; provided, however,
that the foregoing exclusion shall not apply in construing the terms
"Business," "Assets" and "Transferred Intellectual Property" solely as such
terms are set forth in Sections 1.1, 1.2 and the definitions thereof in
Section 12.1 (but, for the avoidance of doubt, such exclusions shall apply
where such defined terms are used elsewhere in the Agreement, and no
additional assets or Intellectual Property shall constitute Assets or
Transferred Intellectual Property solely because they relate primarily to
Excluded Liabilities, Excluded PWR Assets or the RDA Business).

requiring construction or interpretation against the Party drafting or causing
any instrument to be drafted.

11.9 Waivers

  

  

Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the time for its
performance may be extended, by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit
thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently authorized for the
purposes of this Agreement if, as to any Party, it is authorized in writing by
an authorized representative of such Party. The failure of any Party to
enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to
be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this
Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any Party thereafter to enforce
each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall
be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

  

  

11.10 Bulk Sales Laws

  

  

The Parties hereby waive compliance with all applicable "bulk transfer laws"
of any jurisdiction in which the Assets are located or in which operations
relating to the Business are conducted.

  

  

11.11 Expenses

  

  

Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, each Party will pay all costs
and expenses incident to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and
to its performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained
herein on its part to be performed or complied with, including the fees,
expenses and disbursements of its counsel and independent public accountants,
