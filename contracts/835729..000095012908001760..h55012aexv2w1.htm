AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement"), dated as of March 17, 2008, by and among BMC Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Bengal Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and BladeLogic, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware ("Seller"). 

  

 WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of Parent, Purchaser and Seller have approved the acquisition of Seller by Parent on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Purchaser has agreed to commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all Sellers common stock, par value $0.001 per share (" _Seller Common Stock_ "), at a price per share of $28.00 net to the Seller Stockholders in cash (such amount or any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer being hereafter referred to as the " _Offer Price_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, Purchaser will be merged with and into Seller, with Seller as the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ " and, with the Offer, the " _Transaction_ "), whereby each issued and outstanding share of Seller Common Stock not owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or the Seller will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Seller Board has (A) (i) determined that this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of Seller and the Seller Stockholders, (ii) approved the Offer and the Merger in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), and (iii) adopted this Agreement, and (B) recommended that the Seller Stockholders accept the Offer, tender their shares of Seller Common Stock into the Offer, and if required by applicable Law, adopt and approve this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, as an inducement and condition to Parent entering into this Agreement, certain Seller Stockholders and certain directors and executive officers of Seller are entering into tender and stockholder support agreements (collectively, the " _Support Agreements_ ") with Parent and Purchaser simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, whereby, among other things, such stockholders have agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to tender the shares of Seller Common Stock held by such stockholders (in their individual capacities) in the Offer and to support the actions necessary to consummate the Merger; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Transaction and to prescribe certain conditions to the Transaction. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I  THE OFFER 

   

 1.1 _The Offer_. 

   

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article IX hereof and none of the events set forth in clause (iii) of the Tender Offer Conditions shall have occurred, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than March 26, 2008) after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Purchaser to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act) an offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock at the Offer Price, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions hereof and thereof. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver of the Tender Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, promptly after the expiration of the Offer, accept for payment and pay for (after giving effect to any required withholding Tax), all shares of Seller Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn (the time and date of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ "). 

   

 (b) Purchaser reserves the right to waive, in whole or in part, any Tender Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior written consent of Seller, Purchaser shall not decrease the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, waive or amend the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex I hereto), decrease the number of shares of Seller Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, impose additional conditions to the Offer or amend any other term of the Offer in any manner adverse to the Seller Stockholders. The Offer shall remain open until 12:00 midnight, Boston, Massachusetts time, on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days after the commencement (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Expiration Date_ "), unless Purchaser shall have extended the period of time for which the Offer is open pursuant to, and in accordance with, the succeeding sentence or as may be required by applicable Laws or interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") or its staff, in which event the term " _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the latest time and date as the Offer, as so extended, may expire; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may provide a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) after the Expiration Date, in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. If at any Expiration Date, any of the Tender Offer Conditions is not satisfied or waived by Purchaser, Purchaser may extend the Offer from time to time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all of the Tender Offer Conditions other than the Minimum Condition are satisfied or waived as of the scheduled expiration of the initial twenty (20) Business Day offering period, then Purchaser shall extend such Expiration Date on one or more occasions for a total of an additional thirty (30) calendar days; _provided_ _further_  that on any scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer, (i) if the waiting period under the HSR Act or under any material applicable foreign statutes or regulations applicable to the Offer or the Merger shall have not expired or been terminated, Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time until the expiration or termination under the HSR Act or any other material applicable foreign statutes or regulations; or (ii) if any of the Tender Offer Conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of clause (iii) of _Annex I_ hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time until the earlier of (A) five (5) Business Days after the time such condition or conditions shall no longer exist or (B) such time at which any of the matters described in such paragraph (a) of clause (iii) of _Annex I_ hereto shall have become final 

   ##### 

  

   

and non-appealable. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall affect any
termination rights of the parties in Article IX. Subject to the terms of the
Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction of all the Tender Offer
Conditions as of any Expiration Date, Purchaser will accept for payment and
pay for all shares of Seller Common Stock validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after such Expiration Date
of the Offer. 

   

 (c) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer which shall contain the offer to purchase and related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other ancillary documents and instruments required thereby pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Seller Stockholders as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Seller and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to their filing with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Seller and its counsel. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide Seller with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof and prior to responding thereto, and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given). If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to the Offer, the Merger, Seller, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by Seller or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Seller Stockholders, as and to the extent required by applicable Law or any applicable rule or regulation of any stock exchange. Seller shall furnish to Parent and Purchaser all information concerning Seller required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. 

   

 (d) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Seller Common Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and shall cause Purchaser to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement. 

   

 1.2 _Seller Actions_. 

   

 (a) Seller, after affording Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, (a) shall file with the SEC and mail to the Seller Stockholders, as promptly as practicable on the date of the filing by Parent and Purchaser of the Offer Documents, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") reflecting, subject to Section 7.2, the recommendation of the Seller Board that the Seller Stockholders tender their shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and (b) shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 as required 

   ##### 

  

   

by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Schedule 14D-9 will set
forth, and Seller hereby represents, that the Seller Board, at a meeting duly
called and held at which a quorum was present throughout, has unanimously (i)
determined that the Transaction, and each of the Offer and the Merger, is
advisable and in the best interests of Seller and the Seller Stockholders,
(ii) approved the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement in accordance with the
DGCL, (iii) recommended acceptance of the Offer and adoption and approval of
this Agreement by the Seller Stockholders if such adoption and approval is
required by applicable Laws (the " _Seller Recommendations_ "), and (iv)
taken all other action necessary to render Section 203 of the
DGCL inapplicable to each of the Offer and the Merger; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Seller Recommendations may be withdrawn, modified or amended only
prior to the acceptance for payment of shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer and in any case only to the extent permitted by Section 7.2.
Seller hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Seller
Recommendations. Seller shall include in its entirety in the Schedule 14D-9,
and has obtained all necessary consents to permit the inclusion in its
entirety of, the fairness opinion of Sellers Financial advisor delivered to
the Seller Board in connection with the Transaction. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time, any information relating to the Offer, the
Merger, Seller, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates,
should be discovered by Seller or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Schedule 14D-9 so that the Schedule 14D-9
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Seller Stockholders, as and to the extent required by
applicable Law or any applicable rule or regulation of any stock exchange.
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its filing with the SEC,
and Seller shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent, Purchaser or their counsel. Seller agrees to provide Parent
and Purchaser with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written
or oral, that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt thereof and prior to responding
thereto, and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on that
response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given). 

   

 (b) In connection with the Offer, Seller will promptly furnish Purchaser with mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any available listing or computer list containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the shares of Seller Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date, and shall furnish Purchaser with such additional available information and such other assistance as Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to, and soliciting tenders of shares of Seller Common Stock from, Sellers record and beneficial stockholders. Subject to the requirements of applicable Laws, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent, Purchaser and their Representatives, shall keep such information confidential and use the information contained in any such labels, listings and files only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, should the Offer terminate or if this Agreement shall be terminated, will promptly deliver to Seller all copies of such information then in their possession. 

    ##### 

  

     

 1.3 _Directors_. 

   

 (a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, promptly upon acceptance for payment of such number of shares of Seller Common Stock as represents at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and from time to time thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Seller Board as is equal to the product of (x) the total number of directors on the Seller Board (determined after giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) multiplied by (y) the percentage that the aggregate number of shares of Seller Common Stock beneficially owned by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates bears to the total number of shares of Seller Common Stock then outstanding, and Seller shall, upon request of Purchaser, promptly take all actions necessary to cause Purchasers designees to be so elected (including, if necessary, seeking the resignations of one or more existing directors or increasing the size of the Seller Board) in compliance with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall be entitled to designate at least a majority of the directors on the Seller Board (as long as Purchaser and its Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock); _provided further_ that prior to the Effective Time, the Seller Board shall always have at least two members who are not officers, directors, employees or designees of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (" _Purchaser Insiders_ "). If the number of directors who are not Purchaser Insiders is reduced below two prior to the Effective Time, the remaining director who is not a Purchaser Insider shall be entitled to designate a Person to fill such vacancy who is not a Purchaser Insider and who shall be a director not deemed to be a Purchaser Insider for all purposes of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Sellers obligations to appoint Purchasers designees to the Seller Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. Seller shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to Seller and its officers and directors as is required under such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3. Parent will supply to Seller any information with respect to itself and its Affiliates required by such Section and Rule. 

   

 (c) Following the election or appointment of Purchasers designees pursuant to this Section 1.3 and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment or termination of this Agreement by Seller pursuant to Article IX, any extension by Seller of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser hereunder, or waiver of any of Sellers rights or any of the obligations of Parent or Purchaser hereunder will require the consent of a majority of the directors of Seller then in office who are not Purchaser Insiders (or the approval of the sole director if there shall only be one director then in office who is not a Purchaser Insider). Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to this Section 1.3 and prior to the Effective Time, any actions with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement by Seller shall be effected only by the action of a majority of the directors of Seller then in office who are not Purchaser Insiders (or the action of the sole director if there shall only be one director then in office who is not a Purchaser Insider), and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Seller Board and no other action on the part of Seller, including any action by any other director of Seller, shall be required to authorize any such action.

 1.4 _Top-Up Option_. 

   

 (a) Seller hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.4, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer up to that number of newly issued shares of Seller Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Seller Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Seller Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent or Purchaser at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (determined on a "fully diluted basis"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of shares of Seller Common Stock in excess of the shares of Seller Common Stock authorized and unissued at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option and (ii) the Top-Up Option may not be exercised unless, following the time of acceptance by Purchaser of shares of Seller Common Stock tendered in the Offer or after a subsequent offering period, eighty-five percent (85%) or more of the shares of Seller Common Stock shall be directly or indirectly owned by Parent or Purchaser. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once at any time following the Acceptance Date and prior to the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Law, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act. If Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser shall give Seller one (1) Business Day prior written notice, specifying (i) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent or Purchaser at the time of such notice and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. Seller shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Purchaser specifying, based on the information provided by Purchaser in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares (A), the purchase price owed by Purchaser to Seller therefor shall be paid to Seller (i) in cash, by wire transfer or cashiers check or (ii) by issuance by Purchaser to Seller of a promissory note on terms reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser, and (B) Seller shall cause to be issued and delivered to Purchaser a certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Shares or, if Seller does not then have certificated shares of Seller Common Stock, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares. 

   

 (c) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the shares of Seller Common Stock that Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to Seller that Purchaser is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

ARTICLE III  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON SELLER CAPITAL STOCK; 
EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

   

 3.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party hereto or of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of Seller or capital stock of Purchaser: 

   

 (a) _Capital Stock of Purchaser_. Each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. All shares of Seller Common Stock that are owned by Seller or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Seller, and any shares of Seller Common Stock owned by Parent or Purchaser or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Seller Common Stock_. Each share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (x) shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.1(b) and (y) Dissenting Shares as defined in Section 3.3) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Offer Price per share (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Seller Common Stock, when converted as provided in this Section 3.1(c), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ " and collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry share (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ " and collectively, the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") representing any such shares of Seller Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 3.2. 

   

 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock for the Merger Consideration are as follows: 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) designate, or cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to Seller (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller, with such Paying Agent to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration. On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent funds in an amount sufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 3.1 in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.2(b) (such funds, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make all such 

   ##### 

  

   

payments, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional
funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of funds required to make such payments. The Paying Agent shall
make payments of the aggregate Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund
in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent (and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Paying Agent to do so by the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date of the Effective Time) to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 3.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to Section 3.2(h) hereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and Seller may mutually agree or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash equal to the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Seller Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Seller Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Seller, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Seller Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Seller Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time the stock transfer books of Seller shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Seller Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share who has not previously complied with this Section 3.2 prior to the end of such nine (9) month period shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Parent, Purchaser, Seller, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to the requirements of any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments, shall be placed in the Exchange Fund and be payable to Parent. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, Offer Price or consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of a Certificate, a Book-Entry Share or a Seller Stock Option, as the case may be, such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable provision of Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Purchaser or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate, Book-Entry Share, or Seller Stock Option, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

   

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 3.3 _Appraisal Rights_. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") of Seller Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by Seller Stockholders who, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights Provisions_ "), (i) have not voted in favor of adopting this Agreement, (ii) shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares, (iii) have otherwise complied in all respects with the Appraisal Rights Provisions, and (iv) have not effectively withdrawn, lost or failed to perfect their rights to appraisal (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), will not be converted into the Merger Consideration, but at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided under the Appraisal Rights Provisions; _provided_ , _however_ , that all shares of Seller Common Stock held by Seller Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares of Seller Common Stock under the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration relating thereto, without interest, in the manner provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. 

   

 (b) Seller shall give Parent and Purchaser prompt notice of any demands received by Seller for the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to shares of Seller Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands subject, prior to the Effective Time, to consultation with Seller. Seller shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

   

 (c) Each Dissenting Stockholder who becomes entitled under the Appraisal Rights Provisions to payment for Dissenting Shares shall receive payment therefor after the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation (but only after the amount thereof shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to the Appraisal Rights Provisions), and such shares of Seller Common Stock shall be canceled. 

   

 3.4 _Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock and other Equity Awards_. 

   

 (a) " _Cancelled Seller Stock Option_ " shall mean each Seller Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (i) is held by a person who is not an employee or a service provider of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent immediately after the Effective Time as reasonably determined by Parent in its sole discretion, (ii) is vested and exercisable (after taking into account the effect of the accelerated vesting contained in clause (iv) of this Section 3.4(a) or any contract or arrangement providing for the accelerated vesting of outstanding options on or prior to the Effective Time) immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any Seller Stock Options that vest at the Effective Time, (iii) has an exercise price, immediately prior to the Effective Time, that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, or (iv) is subject to the laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and/or held by an employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction and which Parent reasonably determines may not be converted into an Assumed Seller Stock Option (as defined 

   ##### 

  

   

in the paragraph below), (A) under the applicable laws or regulatory
requirements of the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction (including by reason of a
failure to obtain any required regulatory consents or approvals after making
reasonable commercial efforts) or (B) under the generally applicable policies
and practices of Parent with respect to the grant of equity awards in
the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction; _provided_ , _however_ , any such Seller
Stock Options that are not assumed by Parent under this clause (iv) shall be
accelerated in full so that each such option is fully vested and exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the holders of Cancelled Seller Stock Options, each Cancelled
Seller Stock Option shall be cancelled and extinguished and each vested
Cancelled Seller Stock Option shall automatically be converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the aggregate number of Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such
Cancelled Seller Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)
the Merger Consideration less the per share exercise price of such Cancelled
Seller Stock Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "). Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to holders of Cancelled Seller
Stock Options the Option Consideration as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time and in any event within five (5) business days thereof. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, each Seller Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not a Cancelled Seller Stock Option (an " _Assumed Seller Stock Option_ ") shall be converted as of the Effective Time into an option to purchase shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") in accordance with this Section 3.4. At the Effective Time, each Assumed Seller Stock Option shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Seller Stock Option Plans under which such Assumed Seller Stock Option was granted and the agreement evidencing the grant thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time, including provisions with respect to vesting, except that: (i) the terms of the Assumed Seller Stock Option shall be subject to the terms of any Change in Control Agreement, or, if a holder has not entered into a Change in Control Agreement with Seller, the terms of the Assumed Seller Stock Option shall be amended as set forth in the Acceleration Letter, the form of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Acceleration Letter_ "); (ii) such Assumed Seller Stock Option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Seller Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii) the per share exercise price of each such Assumed Seller Stock Option shall be adjusted by dividing (A) the per share exercise price of each such Assumed Seller Stock Option by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding up to the nearest cent. The " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall be equal to the quotient of (1) the Offer Price, divided by (2) the average of the closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange of a share of Parent Common Stock during the five (5) trading days ending on the date that is two (2) trading days prior to the Closing Date. The parties acknowledge that, with respect to any option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code ("incentive stock options" or "ISOs"), the foregoing provisions are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) At the Effective Time, each unvested share of Seller Common Stock subject to restrictions and forfeiture granted pursuant to the Seller Stock Option Plans (" _Restricted Stock_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c), provided that such right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to (x) the same restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such unvested Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the terms of any Change in Control Agreement, or, if a holder has not entered into a Change in Control Agreement with Seller, the terms of the Restricted Stock shall be amended as set forth in the Acceleration Letter, the form of which is attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_. Therefore, cash otherwise payable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for the Restricted Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Unvested Cash_ ") shall not automatically be payable by Parent at the Effective Time, and shall instead become payable by Parent on the date that such shares of Restricted Stock would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule, the agreement evidencing the original purchase of such Restricted Stock, the Change in Control Agreements and the Acceleration Letters). Subject to the terms of the Change in Control Agreements and the Acceleration Letters, Parent shall make all such required payments to holders of Unvested Cash as soon as administratively practicable after the day on which such Unvested Cash would have become vested under the original vesting schedule and in any event no later than fifteen (15) days after the day on which such Unvested Cash becomes vested. All outstanding rights that Seller may hold or similar restrictions in Sellers favor immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Restricted Stock shall be assigned to Parent in the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the Change in Control Agreements and the Acceleration Letter. 

   

 (d) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Assumed Seller Stock Options assumed in accordance with this Section 3.4. Within fifteen (15) business days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of any Assumed Seller Stock Options for which a Form S-8 registration statement is available to be registered with the SEC on Form S-8 and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding. Seller and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement. 

   

 (e) Within fifteen (15) business days following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Seller Stock Options and Restricted Stock appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the Seller Stock Option Plans and describing the adjustments required by this Section 3.4. Seller and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of such notices. 

    ##### 

  

     

 3.5 _Additional Benefits Matters_. 

   

 Seller shall take all necessary actions to effect the transactions described in Sections 3.4(a), (b) and (c) above pursuant to the terms of the applicable Seller Stock Option Plans and agreements evidencing the Seller Stock Options and Restricted Stock. All amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.4(a) and (c) shall be paid without interest, and no Unvested Cash or rights to receive any payments pursuant to Section 3.4(a) or (c) may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than Parent, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any liability of such Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such Unvested Cash or payment pursuant to Section 3.4(a) or (c) in accordance with this Agreement. Any payments made pursuant to 3.4(a) or (c) shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes that Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be required or otherwise permitted by applicable Law to deduct and withhold from the relevant Option Consideration, Unvested Cash or Merger Consideration under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Cancelled Seller Stock Options, Unvested Cash or Restricted Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND 
PURCHASER 

   

 Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered concurrently with the execution of this Agreement to Seller (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), which schedules shall identify any exceptions to the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement (with reference to the particular Section to which such information relates; _provided_ that an item disclosed in any Section shall be deemed to have been disclosed for each other Section of this Agreement to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to such other Section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), Parent and Purchaser hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to Seller as follows: 

   

 4.1 _Corporate Organization_. 

   

 (a) Parent is a Delaware corporation duly organized, validly existing and in corporate good standing under the laws of Delaware. Purchaser is a Delaware corporation duly organized, validly existing and in corporate good standing under the laws of Delaware. 

   

 (b) Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Parent is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in corporate good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in corporate good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, 

   ##### 

  

   

reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Purchaser, copies of which have previously been
made available to Seller, are true, correct and complete copies of such
documents as currently in effect. 

   

 (c) Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Purchaser, which, as of the date hereof, consists of 1,000 shares of Purchaser Common Stock, is validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and is owned, beneficially and of record, by Parent, free and clear of any Encumbrance. Except for obligations and liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser has not and will not have incurred, directly or indirectly, any obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any Person that would impair in any material respect the ability of each of Parent and Purchaser, as the case may be, to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

   

 7.1 _Third Party Consents and Regulatory Approvals_. 

   

 (a) Each of Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents or in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and each of Parent, Purchaser and Seller further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause, respectively, the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the Seller Stockholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws.

by this Agreement, including taking all such further action as reasonably may
be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal
Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities
of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other Person may assert
under Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined) with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as expeditiously possible. The
parties agree that the use of "reasonable best efforts" by Parent shall not
require Parent or Purchaser to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (x) the sale, divestiture
or disposition of any product lines, assets or businesses of either party or
its Affiliates or (y) any restrictions or actions that after the Closing Date
would limit Parents or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporations) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets. For purposes of

national security or the national economy of any nation. 

   

 (c) Subject to and in furtherance of this Section 7.1, Parent and Seller shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, (i) in the case of Parent, all the information relating to Seller and any of its Subsidiaries which appear in, and (ii) in the case of Seller, all the information relating to Parent and Purchaser and any of their Subsidiaries which is required to complete, any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) Parent and Seller shall (i) promptly advise each other of (and Parent or Seller shall so advise with respect to communications received by any Affiliate of Parent or Seller, as the case may be) any written or oral communication from any Governmental Authority or third party whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) to the extent practicable, not participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation, or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other party in advance, and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend; and (iii) promptly furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and written communications between them and their Subsidiaries and Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that materials may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses of Seller, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. Neither Parent nor Seller shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (e) Seller agrees and acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.1, in connection with any filing or submission required, action to be taken or commitment to be made by Seller, Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of Sellers Subsidiaries shall, without Parents prior written consent, sell, divest, or dispose of any assets, commit to any sale, divestiture or disposal of businesses, product lines, or assets of Seller and Sellers Subsidiaries or take any other action or commit to take any action that would limit Sellers, Parents or any of their respective Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain any of, their businesses, product lines or assets or Seller; _provided_  that the foregoing shall not relieve any party of its obligations under this Agreement. 

   

 7.2 _No Solicitation_. 

   

 (a) Upon execution of this Agreement, Seller shall cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

 (b) Except as authorized or permitted in this Section 7.2, Seller agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and their respective 

   ##### 

  

   

Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the submission of any inquiry,
indication of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any non-public
information to any Person (other than Parent or Purchaser) in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any letter of intent or agreement
related to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as
contemplated by Section 7.2(c)), or (iv) approve or recommend an Acquisition
Proposal. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 7.2(b), from the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Date, if Seller or its Representatives receive an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Seller Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, Seller may take the following actions: (i) furnish information to the third party making such Acquisition Proposal (a " _Qualified Bidder_ "); _provided_  Seller receives from the Qualified Bidder an executed confidentiality agreement (the terms of which are no less favorable to Seller than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with the Qualified Bidder and its Representatives with respect to the Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2(e), neither the Seller Board nor any committee of the Seller Board may withdraw or change in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser the Seller Recommendations, or propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding Section 7.2(d), at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Seller Board may in response to a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach by Seller of this Section 7.2, (i) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, and/or (ii) enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") and simultaneously terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(h) if the Seller Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Sellers outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that failure to do so would reasonably be likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such actions may only be taken at a time that is (A) after the third (3rd) Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice from Seller that the Seller Board is prepared to take such action (the " _Subsequent Determination Notice_ "), which notice will specify the material terms of the applicable Acquisition Proposal and identify the Person making such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to such Superior Proposal, including the financial terms of such Superior Proposal, shall require the delivery of a new Subsequent Determination Notice and the commencement of a new three (3) Business-Day period), and (B) at the end of such period, the Seller Board determines in good faith, after taking into account all amendments or revisions irrevocably committed to by Parent and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal. During any such three (3) Business-Day period, Parent shall be entitled to deliver to Seller one or more counterproposals to such Acquisition Proposal, and the Seller shall give Parent the opportunity to meet and negotiate with the Seller and its Representatives. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) From and after the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of the receipt of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations, proposals or expressions of interest with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (including a summary of the material terms and conditions thereof, including price, and the identity of the Person making any Acquisition Proposal). 

   

 (g) Nothing in this Section 7.2 shall be deemed to prohibit Seller from complying with Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal if, in the good faith judgment of the Seller Board or a committee of the Seller Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law (it being understood that any such compliance with Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) may constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change in breach of Sections 7.2(d) and (e)). In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the Seller that describes the Sellers receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look and listen" communication by the board of directors of the Seller pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or any similar communication to the stockholders of the Seller, shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change or an approval or recommendation with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (h) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any written Acquisition Proposal (with all references to 15% in the definition of Acquisition Proposal being treated as references to 50% for these purposes) made by a third party that the Seller Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, is reasonably capable of being consummated, and if consummated would be more favorable to the Seller Stockholders than the Offer and the Merger from a financial point of view, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, including, without limitation, the likelihood of consummation. 

   

 (i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer for any transaction or series of related transactions involving (i) a merger, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, business combination or consolidation, or any similar transaction, involving Seller, (ii) a sale, lease, license, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other acquisition of assets that constitute at least 15% of the assets of Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) a purchase, tender offer or other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, stock exchange or otherwise) of beneficial ownership (the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of securities representing 15% or more of the voting power of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall not include the Offer and the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 7.3 _Access to Information_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (a) Upon reasonable prior notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives of Parent, reasonable access without undue interruption, during normal business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records (other than confidential information contained in personnel files to the extent the disclosure of such information is prohibited by privacy Laws), and their accountants and accountants work papers. Seller also shall provide Parent with such access to the appropriate individuals (including management personnel, attorneys, accountants and other professionals) for discussion of Sellers business, properties, prospects and personnel as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work product privilege. The parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. In furtherance of the foregoing, no information identifying individual employees or consultants of Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller or protected personal information regarding such employees or consultants will be disclosed under this Agreement (including in the Seller Disclosure Schedule) in respect of employees or consultants that are employed (or were employed and remain domiciled) in any country that has enacted legislation implementing the EU Personal Data Privacy Directive or similar legislation, except to the extent permitted by a contractual undertaking entered into by Seller and Parent regarding maintenance of privacy of such data in a form reasonably necessary to effect compliance with such legislation. 

   

 (b) With respect to all information furnished by one party to the other party or its Representatives under this Agreement, the parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 7.4 _Employment and Benefit Matters_. 

   

 (a) _Provision of Benefits_. For the twelve (12) month period commencing on the Acceptance Date, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain health benefits, welfare benefits, but not any stock-based benefits, for the Seller Personnel who remain employed after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Seller Employees_ ") at the same levels that are, in the aggregate, comparable to those in effect for similarly situated employees of Parent on the date hereof. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans in which Seller Employees are entitled to participate to treat, the service of Seller Employees with Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller attributable to any period before the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for other appropriate benefits including, but not limited to, applicability of minimum waiting periods for participation, but excluding benefit accrual (including minimum pension amount) and eligibility for early retirement under any defined benefit plan of Parent or eligibility for retiree welfare 

   ##### 

  

   

benefit plans or as would otherwise result in a duplication of benefits.
Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical
examinations under any health or similar plan of Parent to be waived with
respect to Seller Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent
waived under the corresponding plan in which Seller Employees participated
immediately prior to the Acceptance Date, and any deductibles paid by Seller
Employees under any of Sellers or its Subsidiaries health plans in the plan
year in which the Acceptance Date occurs shall be credited
towards deductibles under the health plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate arrangements with its
insurance carrier(s) to ensure such result. Seller Employees shall
be considered to be employed by Parent "at will" and nothing shall be
construed to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
terminate the employment of any such Seller Employee at any time. Parent will
cooperate with Seller, and assume all costs, in respect of
consultation obligations and similar notice and bargaining obligations owed
to any employees or consultants of Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller in
accordance with all applicable Laws and bargaining agreements, if any. 

   

 (b) _Continuation of Plans_. Subject to Section 7.4(a) hereof, Parent shall have sole discretion with respect to the determination as to whether or when to terminate, merge or continue any employee benefit plans and programs of Seller; provided, however, that Parent shall continue to maintain such employee benefit plans and programs of Seller (other than stock based plans) until the Seller Employees are permitted to participate in the plans and programs of Parent or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 7.4(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at Parents request. Seller shall terminate any Seller Pension Plan that is a 401(k) plan not less than two business days prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Seller and Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section 7.4 with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties and shall not create any right in any other Person, including, without limitation, any employees, former employees, any participant in any Seller Pension Plan, Seller Benefit Plan or Seller Other Plan or any beneficiary thereof or any right to continued employment with Seller, Parent or any Subsidiary of Seller or Parent, nor shall require Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller to continue or amend any particular benefit plan after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any employee or former employee of Seller or any subsidiary of Seller, and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable Law. 

   

 7.5 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

   

 (a) Parent and Purchaser agree that any rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of Seller and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ " and, each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") provided for in the respective organizational documents, in effect as of the date hereof, and the indemnification agreements set forth in Section 7.5 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall continue in full force and effect (and with respect to Seller, shall be reflected in the applicable organizational documents of such entity), for a period of six (6) years after the Acceptance Date. During such period, Parent shall 

   ##### 

  

   

not, nor shall it permit the Surviving Corporation to, amend, repeal or
otherwise modify such provisions for indemnification in any manner that would
materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individual who
at any time on or prior to the Acceptance Date was a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of Seller or its Subsidiaries in respect of
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Acceptance Date (including,
without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless
such modification is required by Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event any claim or claims are asserted or made either prior to the Acceptance
Date or within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect
of any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all
such claims. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Acceptance Date, Seller shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws and regardless of whether the Merger becomes effective, indemnify and hold harmless, and, after the Acceptance Date until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Acceptance Date , Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director or officer of Seller and each Subsidiary of Seller (collectively, the " _Covered Parties_ ") against all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Acceptance Date), whether civil, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacities as officers or directors, in each case occurring before the Acceptance Date (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) Seller or Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall be entitled to control the defense of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (ii) if Seller, Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or counsel selected by the applicable insurer of Seller or the Surviving Corporation) does not elect to control the defense of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, the Covered Party shall be entitled to select counsel for the Covered Party, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Seller or to Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and Seller or Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel promptly after statements therefor are received (unless the Surviving Corporation shall elect to defend such action), (iii) the Covered Party shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iv) none of Seller, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (c) At or prior to the Acceptance Date, Seller shall purchase directors and officers liability insurance (which by its terms shall survive the Offer and the Merger) for its directors and officers, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Acceptance Date on terms acceptable to Seller, so long as the aggregate cost is less than $1,000,000. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. 

   

 (d) The obligations under this Section 7.5 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 7.5 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees 

   ##### 

  

   

to whom this Section 7.5 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 7.5 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained
herein). 

   

 (e) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.5. 

   

 7.6 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Acceptance Date (including after the Effective Time) any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, Parent. 

   

 7.7 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and Seller shall each promptly notify the other party of any change or event having a Parent Material Adverse Effect or Seller Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or which it believes would otherwise be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. 

   

 7.8 _Publicity_. Except with respect to any action taken pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 7.2 or Article IX, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither Parent nor Seller shall, or shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, in which event such party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other parties to review and comment upon such press release or other announcement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the Transaction or this Agreement shall not be required to provide any such review or comment to the other party in connection with any disclosure contemplated by Section 7.2 or any disclosure of Parent or Purchaser in response thereto or in connection therewith. 

   

 7.9 _Rule 16b-3 Actions_. Parent and Seller agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of Seller who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Offer and the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that such Persons not be 

   ##### 

  

   

subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and for that compensatory and
retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 7.9. Promptly after
the date hereof and prior to the Expiration Date, Seller shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of shares of Seller Common
Stock resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to Seller to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law. 

   

 7.10 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller and its Subsidiaries will not, after the date hereof, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any Seller Personnel unless, prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the Seller Compensation Committee shall have taken all such steps as may be necessary to (i) approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement, arrangement, understanding, payment or benefit. 

   

 (b) In the event that, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending not less than five (5) calendar days prior to the Expiration Date, Parent requests that the Seller Compensation Committee consider whether any plan, program, agreement or arrangement that Parent would like to enter into, establish, amend or modify pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any Seller Personnel (each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement, a " _Post-Signing Arrangement_ "), would constitute an Employment Compensation Arrangement and provides Seller with such information with respect to such Post-Signing Arrangement as Seller may reasonably request, the Seller Compensation Committee will promptly, and in any event prior to the Expiration Date, consider such Post-Signing Arrangement at a meeting duly called and held. In the event that, following such consideration, the Seller Compensation Committee believes in good faith that such Post-Signing Arrangement constitutes an Employment Compensation Arrangement, at such meeting the Seller Compensation Committee shall take all such steps as may be necessary to (i) approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement, arrangement, understanding, payment or benefit. 

   

 (c) At the time of any action by the Seller Compensation Committee described in this Section 7.10, each member of the Seller Compensation Committee shall be an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act. 

    #####

 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. 

   

 (a) In the event of a termination and abandonment of this Agreement by either Parent or Seller as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall immediately become void and have no effect, and none of Parent, Purchaser, Seller, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability or obligation of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that Sections 7.3(b) (Access to Information), 9.2 (Effect of Termination), and Article X (Miscellaneous) and all other obligations of the parties specifically intended to be performed after the termination of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Seller shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by such party or such partys stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed to be damages of such party) arising out of its willful breach of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement delivered in connection herewith or any fraud; _provided_  that the failure of Parent or Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for the shares of Seller Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly following the Expiration Date in the event that all Tender Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived as of the Expiration Date, shall be deemed a willful breach by Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement, and Parent shall be liable to Seller for such breach notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by: 

    ##### 

  

     

       | (A)  |   | Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(g); or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | Seller pursuant to Section 9.1(h),  
   

   

then Seller shall make a cash payment to Parent in the amount of
$28,500,000 (the " _Seller Termination Amount_ "). 

  

 (c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Seller pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii) or 9.1(c), and prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced and all the Tender Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived on the Business Day preceding the Expiration Date other than the Minimum Condition (as defined in _Annex_ I), and if within twelve (12) months following such termination, Seller shall have entered into a definitive agreement to engage in, a transaction qualifying as an Acquisition Proposal (with all references to 15% in the definition thereof being treated as references to 50% for purposes hereof) with any Person other than Parent or any Affiliate of Parent, which transaction is subsequently consummated, then Seller shall make a cash payment to Parent of the Seller Termination Amount. 

   

 (d) If required under this Section 9.2, the Seller Termination Amount shall be paid in immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent within two (2) Business Days after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment; _provided_ ,  _however_ , if the Seller Termination Amount is payable as a result of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(h), then the Seller Termination Amount shall be payable prior to and as a condition to the termination. The parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions for payment of the Seller Termination Amount are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are included herein in order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and to reimburse Parent for incurring the costs and expenses related to entering into this Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Seller fails to pay the Seller Termination Amount and Parent or Purchaser commences a suit which results in a final, non-appealable judgment against Seller for the Seller Termination Amount or any portion thereof, then Seller shall pay Parent and Purchaser their costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the Seller Termination Amount at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made thought the date of payment; provided that if the court in such suit determines in a final, non-appealable judgment that Parent or Purchaser is not entitled to the Seller Termination Amount or any portion thereof, then Parent shall pay Seller its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit. 

   

 (e) The parties agree that the payment of the Seller Termination Amount shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Purchaser with respect to this Agreement and the Transaction in the event any payment of the Seller Termination Amount becomes due and payable under the terms of this Agreement, and, upon payment of the Seller Termination Amount, Seller shall have no further liability to Parent and Purchaser hereunder. 

   

 9.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after approval of the matters 

   ##### 

  

   

presented in connection with the Merger to the stockholders of Seller;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that after the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Seller Stockholders,
no amendment of this Agreement shall be made which by Law requires further
approval by the stockholders of Seller without obtaining such approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

   

 9.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Seller Stockholders, no extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof shall be made which by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of Seller without obtaining such approval. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure or delay to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 10.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the exhibits, annexes and schedules hereto, and any documents delivered by the parties in connection herewith and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each of Parent and Purchaser may assign their rights and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent to the extent Purchaser and/or Parent, as applicable, agree to remain liable for the performance of such wholly owned Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder.
