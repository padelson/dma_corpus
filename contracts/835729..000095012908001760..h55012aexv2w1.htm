Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<U>Purchaser</U>&#148;), and BladeLogic,
Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (&#147;Seller&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, the boards of directors of each of Parent, Purchaser and Seller have approved the

Purchaser has agreed to commence a tender offer (the &#147;<U>Offer</U>&#148;) to purchase all Seller&#146;s
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (&#147;<U>Seller Common Stock</U>&#148;), at a price per share of
$28.00 net to the Seller Stockholders in cash (such amount or any greater amount per share paid

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, following consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein,
Purchaser will be merged with and into Seller, with Seller as the surviving corporation (the

outstanding share of Seller Common Stock not owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or
the Seller will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash;

are advisable and in the best interests of Seller and the Seller Stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;approved the
Offer and the Merger in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the

Stockholders and certain directors and executive officers of Seller are entering into tender and
stockholder support agreements (collectively, the &#147;<U>Support Agreements</U>&#148;) with Parent and
Purchaser simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, whereby, among other things, such
stockholders have agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to tender
the shares of Seller Common Stock held by such stockholders (in their individual capacities) in the
Offer and to support the actions necessary to consummate the Merger; and

reasonable efforts to cause the Paying Agent to do so by the fifth (5<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP>) Business Day
following the date of the Effective Time) to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Seller Common Stock whose shares were converted pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.1(c) into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu

Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor cash equal to the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Seller Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Seller Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of
Seller, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;3.2, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Seller
Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time the stock transfer books of Seller shall be
closed and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Seller Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry

or consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of a Certificate, a
Book-Entry Share or a Seller Stock Option, as the case may be, such amounts as it reasonably
determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other applicable provision of Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Purchaser or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Certificate, Book-Entry Share, or Seller Stock Option, as
applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws to the Offer or to the
Merger, or (B)&nbsp;any suit, action or proceeding shall be pending by any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction (or any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have
informed Parent, Purchaser, Seller or counsel therefor that it intends to commence any suit,
action or proceeding) against Parent, Purchaser, Seller or their respective Subsidiaries which
remains pending wherein an unfavorable injunction, judgment, order, decree or ruling, that in the
case of either clause (A)&nbsp;or (B), would reasonably be expected to, directly or indirectly: (i)
make illegal or otherwise prohibit or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger,
(ii)&nbsp;restrict, prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by Parent or Purchaser or their
Subsidiaries of all or any significant portion of the business or assets of Seller or any of its
