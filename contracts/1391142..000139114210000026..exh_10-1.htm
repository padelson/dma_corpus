symbol "EXSG".

 

 

WHEREAS, the QLI Shareholders listed on Schedule I hereto own all of the
issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of QLI (the "QLI Common

WHEREAS, the Parties desire that EXSG acquire all of the QLI Common Stock
from the QLI Shareholders solely in exchange for an aggregate of 10,000,000
newly issued shares of common stock (the "Exchange Shares") pursuant to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

WHEREAS, immediately upon consummation of the Closing (as hereinafter
defined), the Exchange Shares will be issued to the QLI Shareholders on a pro
rata basis, in proportion to the ratio that the number of shares of QLI
Common Stock held by such QLI Shareholder bears to the number of shares of
QLI Common Stock held by all the QLI Shareholders as of the date of the
Closing.

 

 

WHEREAS, following the Closing, QLI will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
EXSG and the Exchange Shares will represent approximately fifty eight percent
(58%) of the total outstanding shares of Common Stock of EXSG.

 

 

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that the transaction contemplated herein (the
"Transaction") qualify as a reorganization and tax-free exchange under
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

 

 

NOW THEREFORE, on the stated premises and for and in consideration of the
foregoing recitals which are hereby incorporated by reference, the mutual
covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth and the mutual benefits to the
Parties to be derived herefrom and for other good and valuable consideration,

Common Stock. The aggregate number of shares of EXSG Stock exchanged for
the QLI Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be 10,000,000. From

Exchange Shares issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to this Agreement.
Any fractional shares that would result from such exchange will be rounded up
to the next highest whole number.

 

 

1.2 No Dilution. EXSG shall neither effect, nor fix any record date
with respect to, any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, recapitalization, or similar change in the EXSG Stock between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time.

 

 

1.3 Closing. The closing ("Closing") of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall occur immediately following the execution of this Agreement
providing the closing conditions set forth in Articles V and VI have been
satisfied or waived (the "Closing Date").

 

 

1.4 Closing Events. At the Closing, each of the respective parties hereto
shall execute, acknowledge, and deliver (or shall cause to be executed,
acknowledged, and delivered) any and all stock certificates, officers'
certificates, opinions, financial statements, schedules, agreements,
resolutions, rulings, or other instruments required by this Agreement to be
so delivered at or prior to the Closing, and the documents and certificates
provided in Sections 5.2, 5.4, 6.2, 6.4 and 6.5, together with such other
