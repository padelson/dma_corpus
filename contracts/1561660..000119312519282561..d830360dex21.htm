The certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated at the Effective
Time to read in the form of _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ and, as so amended and
restated, such certificate of incorporation shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or pursuant to applicable
Laws (as defined in Section 4.2(i)). The parties shall take all necessary
action such that, as of the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation, except that all references to Merger Subs name shall
be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or pursuant to applicable
Laws.

Section 2.2 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.
The directors of Merger Sub shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly

necessary to implement the provisions of this Section 2.2.

 

ARTICLE III

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of
any capital stock of the Company:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than the
Excluded Shares (as defined in Section 3.3(h)) (each, an " _Eligible Share_ "
and collectively, " _Eligible Shares_ "), shall be converted into the right
to receive $26.75 per share of Company Common Stock, in cash, without interest
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all Eligible Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and (A) each certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such Eligible Shares (a " _Certificate_ ";
_provided_ , _however_ , than any references herein to "Certificates" are
deemed to include references to effective affidavits of loss in accordance
with Section 3.2(i)) and (B) each book-entry account that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any uncertificated Eligible Shares (a "
_Book-Entry Share_ "), shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders become entitled, without interest. For the avoidance of doubt, subject
to _Section_ __ _ 5.1(a)(vi)_, nothing in this Agreement shall affect the
right of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive any
dividend or other distribution which is declared on Company Common Stock, the
record date of which occurs prior to the Effective Time and the payment date
of which occurs prior to, on or after the Effective Time. 

(b) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



3

    

(c) _Cancellation or Conversion of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder of such Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding, be canceled without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any
rights the holder thereof may have under Section 3.2(g).

(d) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(e) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by this Agreement), the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock is changed into a different number of shares or a
different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock
split, combination or exchange of shares, or if any similar event occurs, then
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted
to provide to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

Section 3.2 _Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying_ _Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a
commercial bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") who shall also act as agent
for the holders of Eligible Shares for the delivery of the Merger
Consideration and who shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares
represented thereby. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares a cash
amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to
make payments of the aggregate Merger Consideration under Section 3.2(a). In
addition, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions that
holders of Company Common Stock have the right to receive. All such cash
deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 3.2(a) is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ ". The agreement pursuant to which Parent
shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of an Eligible Share converted pursuant to Section 3.1(a) into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form as reasonably agreed by the parties which (A) shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent or, in the case of Book-

 



4

    

 Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal and (B) shall have such other provisions as the Company and Parent
may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.

 

(i) Upon surrender of a Certificate or of a Book-Entry Share to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 3.2(g)), a cash amount in immediately available funds
equal to (A) (1) the number of Eligible Shares that such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share represented immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied
by_ (2) the Merger Consideration _plus_ (B) any dividends or other
distributions that such holder has the right to receive, and the Certificate
or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall immediately be canceled.

(ii) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration that the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share has the
right to receive in respect of the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
pursuant to Section 3.1 and any dividends or other distributions that such
holder has the right to receive. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check representing
the Merger Consideration that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 3.1 and any dividends or other distributions that the holder has the
right to receive may be delivered to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and by evidence that any applicable transfer Taxes (as defined in Section
4.2(n)) have been paid.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The cash paid in
accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been
delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (i) all
holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights
as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions that holders have the
right to receive, without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
III.

 



5

    

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Company Common
Stock converted pursuant to the Merger for 365 days after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand. Any holder of Eligible Shares who
has not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only
to Parent for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and any
dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this Article III.

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Payment Fund or the Merger Consideration properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any
portion of the Merger Consideration or the cash to be paid in accordance with
this Article III that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common
Stock as of the third anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as
defined in Section 4.2(d)(i))), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement,
" _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
other entity of any kind or nature.

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in
the Payment Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investment shall be in (i) obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States
of America, (ii) in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under
U.S. federal or state Laws, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or (iii) in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual funds
investing in such assets. Any such investment shall be for the benefit, and
at the risk, of Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such
investment shall be for the benefit of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration or
any dividends or other distributions payable to holders of Company Common
Stock, and Parent shall promptly provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to promptly provide, additional funds to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of holders of Company Common Stock in the amount of any such losses
to the extent necessary to satisfy the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Article III.

 

(g) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by such Person unless and
until such Person shall have 

 



6

    

 effectively withdrawn or lost such Persons right to appraisal under the
DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the
payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If, after the Effective
Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such
right, each Excluded Share of such holder shall thereupon be treated as if it
had been converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, and Parent shall remain liable for payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration for shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments that are received by
the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the
opportunity to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make or offer to make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Paying Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

 

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to Section
3.2(e), Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 3.3  _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

(a) _Treatment of Company Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each
Company Restricted Share (as defined in Section 3.3(h)) (other than a Company

Merger and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder
thereof, be vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse in full as of
immediately before the Effective Time; and each such Company Restricted Share
shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 3.1(a).

 



7

    

(b) _Treatment of Company Performance Shares_. At the Effective Time, each
Company Performance Share (as defined in Section 3.3(h)) (other than a
Company Performance Share set forth on Section 3.3(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the " _Scheduled Company Performance Shares_ "))
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder
thereof, be vested based on the maximum level of performance and all
restrictions thereon shall lapse for such Company Performance Share as of
immediately before the Effective Time; and each such Company Performance Share
shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 3.1(a).

 

(c) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU (as
defined in Section 3.3(h)) award outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, automatically and without any required action on the
part of the holder thereof, be vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse
in full as of immediately before the Effective Time; and each such Company

Oxley Act_ "), Canadian Securities Laws and, in each case, any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, applicable to the Company Reports. As of
their respective filing dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of filing of such amendment), the Company Reports
did not, and any Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC or the
Canadian Securities Authorities subsequent to the date of this Agreement will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. The Company has made available to Parent all
correspondence with the SEC and with the Canadian Securities Authorities since
December 31, 2017 and, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments from the SEC or the Canadian Securities
Authorities with respect to any of the Company Reports and the Company has not
filed any confidential material change report with the Canadian
Securities Authorities which remains confidential. No Subsidiary of the
Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

 

(ii) (A) The Company maintains _"_ disclosure controls and procedures" and
"internal controls over financial reporting" (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are effective
to (1) ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is
recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for
the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and the Canadian
Securities Authorities and other public disclosure documents and (2) provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial
reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial statements for

principles applied on a consistent basis (" _GAAP_ ") and (B) the Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this
Agreement, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the

reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,

 



18

    

 process, summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has substantially
addressed any such deficiency, material weakness or fraud.

 

(iii) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and each
former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations
of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company Reports, and the
statements contained in such certifications were true and correct on the date
such certifications were made. For purposes of this Section 4.2(e)(iii)
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any outstanding "extensions of credit" or has arranged
any outstanding "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers in
violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder.

 

(iv) Except for matters resolved prior to the date hereof, since December __
31, 2017, (i) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and
representatives (" _Representatives_ ") has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,

their respective internal accounting controls, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices and
(ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported

respective officers, directors or agents to the Company Board or any committee
thereof or to the chief executive officer or general counsel of the Company in
accordance with Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder.

(v) (A) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated
by reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) (x) complies as to form in all material respects, or, in the case
of Company Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will comply as to
form in all material respects, with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC and the Canadian Securities Authorities (including all applicable
accounting rules) and (y) fairly presents in all material respects, or, in
the case of Company Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will

Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present in all

consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to notes and year-end or other audit
adjustments, none of which would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect), in each case in this clause (v) in accordance with
GAAP, except as may be noted therein.

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December __31, 2018, (i) there has not
been any change, event, effect, circumstance or development that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would be reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries
have conducted their businesses in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice in all material respects and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any action that if taken after the date of this
Agreement would, absent Parents consent, constitute a breach of any of
the covenants set forth in clause (iii), (vi), (vii) or (xiv) __of Section
5.1(a).

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_.

 

(i) Other than as would not be, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably

or other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened

20

    

(h) _Employee Benefits_.

 

(i) Section 4.2(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate
and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each material Company
Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Plan_ " means any benefit or
compensation plan, program, policy, practice, agreement, contract, arrangement
or other obligation, whether or not in writing and whether or not funded, in
each case, which is sponsored, maintained, administered or contributed to by
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Pattern Energy Group LP (" _Pine LP_
"), a subsidiary of Pattern Energy Group Holdings LP, and which covers any
current or former employee, director or other independent contractor of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Pine LP (each, a " _Company Participant_
"), or with respect to which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Pine LP
has any liability, whether direct, indirect, actual or contingent, other than
a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ") (each, a "
_Multiemployer Plan_ "). Company Plans include, but are not limited to,
"employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (each such plan,
a " _Company ERISA Plan_ "), employment, retirement, severance, termination or
change in control agreements, deferred compensation, equity-based,
incentive, bonus, supplemental retirement, profit sharing, insurance,
medical, welfare, fringe or other benefits or remuneration of any kind.

 

(ii) With respect to each material Company Plan, the Company has made
available to Parent, to the extent applicable, accurate and complete copies
of (1) the Company Plan document, including any amendments thereto, and
summaries of material modifications, (2) any related trust agreements,
insurance contracts, insurance policies or other documents of any
funding arrangements, (3) a written description of such Company Plan if such
plan is not set forth in a written document, (4) for the most recent year, any
notices to or from the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") or any office or
representative of the United States Department of Labor or any other
Governmental Entity relating to any compliance or other issues with respect to
any such Company Plan and (5) the most recently prepared actuarial report.
Except for liabilities that would not be, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (A) each Company
Plan has been established, administered and registered in accordance with its
terms and is in compliance with applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code
and (B) no event has occurred, and no condition exists, that would subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective predecessors),
either directly or by reason of its affiliation with any Company ERISA
Affiliate, to any Tax (as defined in Section 4.2(n)), fine, Lien, penalty or
other liability or obligation imposed by ERISA, the Code or any other
applicable Law arising out of or relating to any Company Plan. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Company ERISA Affiliate_ " means all employers (whether
or not incorporated) that would be treated together with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 414 of
the Code.

 



21

    

(iii) With respect to each Company ERISA Plan, the Company has made available
to Parent, to the extent applicable, accurate and complete copies of (1) the
most recent summary plan description together with any summaries of all
material modifications thereto, and (2) the most recent IRS determination
or opinion letter. Each Company ERISA Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and to the Knowledge of the
Company, nothing has occurred that would adversely affect the qualification
or tax exemption of any such Company Plan. With respect to any Company ERISA
Plan, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has engaged in a
transaction in connection with which the Company or any of its Affiliates
reasonably could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to
Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or
4976 of the Code in an amount that could be material.

 

(iv) Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate has ever sponsored,
maintained, contributed to, been required to contribute to or otherwise had
any liability or obligation with respect to an employee benefit plan that is a
defined benefit plan or subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 302 of ERISA
or Sections 412 or 4971 of the Code, including any Multiemployer Plan. No
Company Plan is (i) a multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in
Section 3(4) of ERISA or (ii) a plan that has two or more contributing
sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the
meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA.

(v) No Company Plan provides post-termination or retiree life
insurance, health or other medical benefits or coverage to any person, except
as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code or any similar Law (as defined
in Section 4.2(i)) and at no expense to the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company.

 

(vi) Except as set forth on Section 4.2(h)(vi) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, stockholder or
other approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or in
combination with another event: (1) entitle any Company Participant to
severance pay or any material increase in severance pay (other than severance
pay required by any Law), (2) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
materially increase the amount of compensation due to any
Company Participant, (3) result in any payment that would be an "excess
parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code or (4) limit the ability of
the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to merge, amend or terminate any
Company Plans. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not required to provide
any gross-up, indemnification, reimbursement or other additional payment in
respect of any Tax, interest or penalty related thereto.

 

(vii) All Company Plans that are maintained outside the jurisdiction of the
United States or cover any employees or other service providers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who reside or work outside of the United
States (each such plan, a " _Company_ _Non-U.S. Benefit Plan_") comply
with applicable Law and, to the extent intended to be funded and/or book-
reserved, are funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon
reasonable actuarial assumptions, except in each case as

 



22

    

 would not be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
would not be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each
Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plan has assets or book reserves, as applicable
(determined, in each case, in accordance with applicable funding standards,
International Financial Reporting Standards or other applicable accounting
principles) that are sufficient to provide for the payment of the relevant
benefits.

(i) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_. The businesses of each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have not been since December 31, 2017, and are not being,
conducted in violation of any federal, state, provincial, local or foreign
law, statute or ordinance, common law, or any rule, regulation, guideline,
standard, judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency
requirement, license or permit of any Governmental Entity (collectively, "
_Laws_ "), except for violations that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of
the Merger. As of the date of this Agreement, no investigation by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has any
Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for
such investigations or reviews the outcome of which would not be,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the Merger. Since December 31, 2017, the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has obtained and is in compliance with all licenses, permits,
certifications, approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations,
franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted by a
Governmental Entity (" _Licenses_ ") necessary to own, lease and operate their
properties and assets and conduct their businesses as presently conducted,
except those the absence of which would not be, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All
Licenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, no
default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) has occurred under
any such License, and to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company or
its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any Governmental Entity
threatening to suspend, revoke, withdraw, modify or decline to renew any such
License, in each case, except as would not be, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(j) _Material Contracts_.

(i) Section 4.2(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all Contracts of the
following types to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or

continuing material obligations;

 

(F) any material joint venture, profit-sharing, partnership or other similar

Each such Contract required to be disclosed in clauses (A) through (J),
whether entered into before or after the date of this Agreement is referred
to herein as a " _Material Company Contract_ ".

(ii) True and correct copies of each Material Company Contract have been made
available to Parent. Except for expirations or terminations in the ordinary
course of business in accordance with the terms of such Material Company
Contracts, each of the Material Company Contracts is valid and binding on the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect and
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except for such failures to be
valid and binding or to be in full force and effect and enforceable as would
not be, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. There is no default under any such Material Company
Contracts by the Company or its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any other party thereto, and no event has occurred that with the
lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default
thereunder by the Company or its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any other party thereto, in each case except as would not be,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(k) _Real Property_.

 true and complete list of all material Company Owned Real Property, except
for any Company Owned Real Property used in connection with, or incidental to,

reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the Company or a Company Material Subsidiary, as
applicable, has exclusive possession of each Company Owned Real Property,
other than any use and occupancy rights, without any options to purchase,
granted to third-party tenants or licensees pursuant to agreements entered
into in the ordinary course of business.

(ii) With respect to the real property leased, subleased, licensed or
otherwise occupied by the Company or the Company Material Subsidiaries (the "
_Company Leased Real Property_ "), the lease, sublease, license or other
occupancy agreement for such property is valid, is legally binding on and
enforceable by its terms against the Company or the Company Material
Subsidiaries (as applicable) and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the other
party thereto, and is in full force and effect, and none of the Company or any
of the Company Material Subsidiaries is in breach of or default under such
lease or sublease, and no event has occurred which, with notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a breach or default by any of the Company or the
Company Material Subsidiaries, except in each case, for such invalidity,

the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and the Company
Material Subsidiaries have a valid and enforceable right to use any real
property that is used in the business but is not Company Owned Real Property
or Company Leased Real Property.

and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry

foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such 

 



34

    

 qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in
good standing, or to have such power or authority, has not had and would not
be, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the Company complete and
correct copies of the certificates of incorporation and by-laws or comparable
governing documents of Parent and Merger Sub, each as amended to the date of
this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force and effect as of the

Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Capital Structure_.

 

(i) The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 1,000 shares
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. All of the issued and

convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Company Common Stock are owned
(directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record), or controlled or
directed, by Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents other Subsidiaries. None of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents other Subsidiaries holds any rights to

Subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, this Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by each other party hereto (except for Parent),

Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, this Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and

materially impair the consummation of the Merger.

 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement do not and the consummation of the Merger and the other

Merger Sub, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or default or loss of a

which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or assets is
subject, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach,
violation, termination, default, loss, creation, acceleration or change that
would not be, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



36

(g) _Financing Commitments_.

 

(i) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of (i) the

party thereto and any fee letters with the Debt Financing Sources party
thereto associated therewith; _provided_ that provisions in the fee letter
have been redacted with respect to fees, other economic terms and "market
flex" items in a customary manner; _provided_ , _further_ , that none of such
redacted provisions impose or permit additional conditions (or the expansion
of any existing conditions) on the availability of the Debt Financing at the
Closing (such commitment letter, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes
and amendments thereto and each such fee letter, collectively, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources party
thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to
lend the amounts set forth therein for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ "). Parent has also delivered to the
Company a true, correct and complete copy of the executed equity commitment
letter (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to such
letter in effect as of the date hereof) from Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board (the " _Equity Investor_ ") (the " _Equity Commitment_ " and together
with the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to
which the Equity Investor has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, to invest the cash amount set forth therein for the

Commitments 

 



37

    

 have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Except for the fee
letters referred to above and customary engagement letters and fee credit
letters with respect to the Debt Financing (none of which reduces the amount
of the Debt Financing below the Required Amounts (as defined below) (after
taking into account the amount of the Equity Financing) or adversely affects
the conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability of the Debt
Financing), as of the date hereof, there are no side letters or contracts or
other arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party that impose
conditions to, affect the availability of or modify, amend or expand the
conditions to the funding of the Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments
delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof,
Parent has fully paid any and all commitment or other fees in connection with
the Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and
Parent will continue to pay in full any such amounts required to be paid as
and when they become due and payable on or prior to the Closing Date.
Assuming the Financing is consummated in accordance with the terms of the
Financing Commitments and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII, the aggregate proceeds to be disbursed to Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to the Financing Commitments will be sufficient for the Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and to pay all
related fees and expenses associated therewith incurred or otherwise payable
by Parent (collectively, the " _Required Amounts_ "). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Debt Financing Sources_ " means the entities that have committed
to provide the Debt Financing or any replacement financing or other debt
financings in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter and any agreements or credit
agreements related thereto) or who have otherwise entered into agreements in
connection with the foregoing (including, without limitation, each arranger
and agent) and their respective Affiliates and such entities and their
respective Affiliates Representatives involved in the Debt Financing or any
replacement financing or other debt financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and their successors and permitted assigns.

force and effect and are the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent or
Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto,
enforceable against such parties in accordance with their terms, except as
enforceability is subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. Assuming that the
conditions set forth in Article VIII are satisfied at the Closing, as of the
date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that (with or without notice,
lapse of time, or both) would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or
default under the Financing Commitments by Parent or Merger Sub. As of the
date of this Agreement, Parent has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances
that are reasonably likely to result in (i) any of the conditions set forth in
the Financing Commitments not being satisfied on a timely basis or (ii) the

45

    

 Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below), it being understood that such

applicable) that such Company Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Company Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Company Proposal.

its Subsidiaries or (ii) direct or indirect acquisition by any Person or

regulatory and other aspects of such Company Acquisition Proposal and the
Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal (including risks and timing
of consummation, and any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to
by Parent in response to such Company Acquisition Proposal), that such Company

Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) against acceptance of
such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the Company

with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its
stockholders, which shall constitute a failure to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer), or (E) approve,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable or publicly propose to approve,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Company Acquisition Proposal or

Proposal and (z) __ that was not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the
Company Board, the Company Special Committee or any other duly authorized
committee of the Company Board, as applicable, as of the date of this
Agreement or, if known, the consequences of which were not known or

Company Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Company Proposal or
otherwise, the Company Board, the Company Special Committee or any other duly
authorized committee of the Company Board shall take into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent, and if requested by
Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, engage in
good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives during the
applicable notice period regarding any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent.

insurance can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum
Amount, Parent shall obtain the most advantageous policy of directors __ and
officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Amount. If Parent and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain
such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,

Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and
eligibility to participate under each applicable Parent benefit plan, as if
such service had been performed with Parent, except for benefit accrual under
defined benefit pension plans, for purposes of qualifying for subsidized
early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits.

(c) If the Effective Time occurs prior to the payment of the bonuses in
respect of calendar year 2019 (the " _2019 Bonuses_ "), Parent agrees to, and
agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to Continuing Employees the

with past practice (" _2019 Annual Bonus Targets_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) the Company shall determine actual achievement of the 2019 Annual

"cause" prior to the payment of the 2019 Bonuses will be entitled to receive
the 2019 Bonus applicable to such Continuing Employee, such 2019 Bonus to be

promptly as reasonably practicable after it gives notice of the Company
Meeting (subject to any time frame as may be required by applicable Law or
agreed by Parent and the Company). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 7.2(d), if on a date for which the Company Meeting is scheduled,
the Company has not received proxies

 



58

    

 representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock to obtain the Requisite Company Approval(s), whether
or not a quorum is present, or if Parent has provided consent, the Company
shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Company Meeting, _provided_ that the Company Meeting is
not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date
for which the Company Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Laws). The Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent and keep Parent
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation
efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement
to its stockholders. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger) shall be the only matter (other than procedural matters) that the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the
Company Meeting.

 

Section 7.3 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding the
Merger shall be a joint press release agreed to by the parties, which each of
the Company and Parent shall be permitted to file with any Governmental Entity
as may be required by applicable Law. Thereafter, the Company and Parent shall
consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon any press release, public announcement, public statement or other public
disclosure, prior to the issuance of any such press release, public
announcement, public statement or other public disclosure, with respect to the
Merger and shall not issue any such press release, public announcement,
public statement or other public disclosure, prior to such consultation except
as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer
quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the restrictions in this Section 7.3 shall not apply to any
communication regarding a Company Recommendation Change; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no further mutual agreement shall be required with respect to
any such press releases, public announcements, public statements or other
public disclosures that are consistent with prior press releases, public
announcements, public statements or other public disclosures made in
compliance with this Section 7.3. Prior to making any written communications
to the employees or independent contractors of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or Pine LP pertaining to compensation or benefit matters
that are affected by the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company shall
provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication at least three
business days prior to the date of first use, and the Company shall consider
in good faith any comments made to such communication (it being understood
that any subsequent communication that sets forth substantially the same
information shall not require compliance with this sentence).

Section 7.4 _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify and provide copies to the other of (a) any written notice or
other material communication from any Person alleging that the approval or
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger,
(b) any written notice or other material communication from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger, (c) any proceeding or investigation,
commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company or the Knowledge of Parent, as
applicable, threatened against, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that would be
reasonably likely to (i) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger or (ii) result in the failure of any 

 



59

    

 condition to the Merger set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied, or (d)
the occurrence of any event which would or would be reasonably likely to (i)
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or (ii) result in
the failure of any condition to the Merger set forth in Article VIII to be
satisfied. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall not
(x) affect or be deemed to modify any representation, warranty, covenant,
right, remedy, or condition to any obligation of any party hereunder or (y)
update any section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter. Any failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall
not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 7.4 or the failure of
any condition to the Merger set forth in Article VIII, or otherwise constitute
a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each
case, except to the extent that (i) the other party is actually materially
prejudiced by such failure to provide such information or deliver such notice
or (ii) such failure to provide such information or deliver such notice would
independently result in the failure of any condition to the Merger set forth
in Article VIII (other than Sections 8.2(b) or 8.3(b), as applicable).

 

Section 7.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.5, whether
or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense. All filing fees in respect of any regulatory approvals
required under the Competition Act (Canada) shall be the responsibility
of Parent, provided that each of Parent and the Company shall be responsible
for its own legal fees relating to the foregoing.

 

Section 7.6 _Financing_.

 

(a) _Financing_.

 

(i) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Commitments (and in the case of the Debt
Commitment Letter, taking into account any "market flex" provisions) and,
prior to the Closing, shall not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, if such
amendment, modification or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing below the amount necessary to fund the Required Amounts or (B)
impose new or additional conditions (or otherwise amend, modify or expand any
conditions) to the receipt of the Financing or other terms, in each case, in
a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or materially delay
or impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or (y) make the funding of the Debt Financing or the equity Financing (or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining any of the Financing) less likely
to occur or otherwise adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub (as
applicable) to enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing
Commitments or to draw upon and consummate the Financing. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is understood that, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 7.6(a)(i) and in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent and Merger Sub
may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add or replace lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities. Any reference
in this Agreement to

 



60

    

 (1) "Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments as amended or modified in compliance with this Section 7.6(a)(i)
and (2) "Financing Commitments", "Equity Commitment" or "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall include such documents as amended or modified in compliance with
this Section 7.6(a)(i).

 

(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 7.6, each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in
effect and satisfy on a timely basis all terms, covenants and conditions
(unless waived pursuant to the terms thereof) set forth in the Financing
Commitments, (B) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms
and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter (or on terms not materially less favorable, in
the aggregate with respect to conditionality, to Parent or Merger Sub than
the terms and conditions (including the "market flex" provisions) in the Debt
Commitment Letter) that are acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub and would not
adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein, (C) satisfy all conditions (unless waived
pursuant to the terms thereof) to such definitive agreements on a timely
basis, (D) enforce its rights under the Financing Commitments and (E) draw
upon and consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, in any case,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Financing Commitments. To the
extent requested by the Company from time to time and subject to the last
sentence of this Section 7.6(a)(ii), Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail with
respect to all material activity concerning the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the Company promptly, and in any event
within two business days after it becomes aware thereof, (x) of any breach or
default by any party to any Financing Commitment or definitive document
related to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub become aware, (y) of
the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or communication
(other than negotiations of the definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing) from any Debt Financing Source or Equity Investor with respect to
any actual material and adverse breach, default, termination or repudiation by
any party to any Financing Commitments or definitive documents related to the
Financing or any dispute or disagreement between or among any parties thereto
that would reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to obtain all or any part of the Financing on the terms and in the
manner contemplated by the Financing Commitments, or (z) if Parent or Merger
Sub expects that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the
Financing Commitments or the definitive documents related to the Financing;
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to disclose
any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if
Parent or Merger Sub (as applicable) shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such
privilege.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 7.6, if any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter shall
be terminated or modified in a manner that would have a materially adverse
impact on Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the

 



61

    

 Debt Financing, (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and
(B) each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources (w) on
terms and conditions no less favorable, with respect to conditionality, to
Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, (x)
with no conditions to funding the Debt Financing that are not contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter, (y) that would not reasonably expected to prevent,
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Debt Financing or such
alternative financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(z) in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that
is available to pay in cash the Required Amounts (the " _Alternate Debt
Financing_ "), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect
to such Alternate Debt Financing (the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ "), which
shall replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter, a copy of which shall be
promptly provided to the Company;  _provided_ that neither Parent nor Merger
Sub shall be required to accept any Alternate Debt Financing having terms and
conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) less favorable to Parent
or Merger Sub than those in the Debt Commitment Letter. In the event any New
Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Financing" or the "Debt Financing" shall mean the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below,
(ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Commitments" or the
"Debt Commitment Letters" shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment
Letters that are not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time
in question and the New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect
and (iii) Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed to be in compliance with this
Section 7.6 to the extent that prior to obtaining such new Debt Commitment
Letter Parent or Merger Sub was in breach of this Section 7.6.

(c) In connection with the Debt Financing, from the date hereof until the
Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to use its reasonable
best efforts to provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent or
Merger Sub and that is necessary or customary in connection with Parents and
Merger Subs efforts to obtain the Debt Financing ( _provided_ that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company), including their respective reasonable best efforts
to: (i) upon reasonable prior notice, participate in a reasonable number of
meetings, conference calls, presentations and roadshows with prospective
lenders and investors, due diligence sessions (including accounting due
diligence sessions), drafting sessions and sessions with the rating
agencies; (ii) reasonably assist Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing
Sources in the preparation of pertinent information regarding the Company and

and affiliates of Parent contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as obligor(s); (iii) provide
customary authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources (including
customary representations with respect to accuracy of information contained in
the disclosure and material non-public information) for inclusion in any bank
information or materials that authorizes the distribution of information to
be distributed to prospective lenders; (iv) assist with the pledging of
collateral by the Company or its Subsidiaries (including the execution and
delivery by the Company or its Subsidiaries of 

 



62

    

 customary pledge and security documents); _provided_ , that any such pledge
or other encumbrances shall be authorized and only become effective at, or as
of, the Closing; (v) request and facilitate its independent auditors to (A)
provide, consistent with customary practice (I) such accountants customary
comfort letters and reports as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger
Sub with respect to financial information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the consent of such auditors to the use of their reports in
any materials relating to the Debt Financing; (vi) facilitate the execution
and delivery of definitive financing documents, customary perfection
certificates and other certificates (including a solvency certificate in the
form attached to the Debt Commitment Letter), legal opinions of counsel or
other documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub,
in each case, with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_
that no obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries under any document,
agreement or pledge shall be effective until the Closing; (vii) request
consents, surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent or
Merger Sub; (viii) request customary payoff letters relating to the repayment
of any existing indebtedness to be repaid concurrently with the Closing and/or
the termination of any third party liens securing such indebtedness; (ix)
provide Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Sources with customary
documentation and other information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries at least five business days prior to the Closing Date as shall
have been reasonably requested in writing by Parent or Merger Sub at least ten
business days prior to the Closing Date, that is required in connection with
the Debt Financing by regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
PATRIOT Act, and that are required by the Debt Commitment Letter; and (x)
reasonably cooperate with the Debt Financing Sources "due diligence"
investigation with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_
that the Company shall not be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Financing prior
to the Closing for which it is not reimbursed by Parent. The Company hereby
consents to the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection
with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 7.6(c), nothing will require the Company to
provide (or be deemed to require the Company to prepare) any (1) pro forma
financial statements; (2) information regarding any post-Closing or pro forma
cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other post-Closing pro
forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any information used in
connection with the Debt Financing; (3) description of all or any portion of
the Financing, including any "description of notes"; (4) risk factors

non-convertible high-yield debt securities under Rule 144A promulgated under
the Securities Act.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 7.6(c) to the contrary, (i) such
requested cooperation shall not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the
business or the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) nothing in
this Section 7.6 shall require cooperation to the extent that it would (A)
subject any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries respective directors,
managers, officers or employees to any actual or potential personal liability

 



63

    

 (as opposed to liability in his or her capacity as an officer of such
Person) with respect to matters related to the Debt Financing, (B) conflict
with, or violate, the Companys and/or any of its Subsidiaries
organizational documents or any applicable Law, (C) cause any condition to the

be required to take any action that would subject it to actual or potential
liability, to bear any cost or expense or to make any other payment or agree

definitive financing agreements for the Debt Financing, the Financing or any
information utilized in connection therewith, in each case, that would not be
reimbursed or indemnified by Parent or Merger Sub, (iv) none of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers or employees shall be
required to deliver or obtain opinions of internal or external counsel,

Financing, with respect to the Financing (other than customary representation
letters and authorization letters referred to above) that, in each case, is
not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the
Effective Time and the directors and managers of the Companys Subsidiaries
shall not be required to adopt resolutions approving the
agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to which the Financing is
obtained prior to the Effective Time unless Parent and Merger Sub shall have
determined that such directors and managers are to remain as directors and
managers of the Companys Subsidiaries on and after the Effective Time and
such resolutions are contingent upon the occurrence of, or only effective as
of, the Effective Time and (v) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to maintain attorney-client privilege.
The Parties agree that Parents or Merger Subs execution of a New Debt
Commitment Letter shall not materially expand the scope of the assistance
required under Section 7.6(c) as compared to the assistance that would be
required or expected to be required in connection with the Debt Commitment
Letter in effect on the date of this Agreement and the related Debt Financing.

 

(e) Parent shall, (a) promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses

Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 7.6, and (b) indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective

the Company or any of its Affiliates).

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in
Section 8.3(b) of this Agreement, as it applies to the Companys obligations
under this Section 7.6, shall be deemed satisfied unless the Companys Willful

alternative financing, if applicable).

the principal cause of or resulted in the occurrence of the failure of a
condition to the consummation of the Merger; or

 

(c) if (i) all the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.3 have
been satisfied or waived and remain satisfied or waived at the time when the

71

than at Closing) shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement or at the time of such termination referred to in clause (x)(B) or
(y)(B) above, (I) this Agreement could not be terminated pursuant to Section

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the
case of damages resulting from Fraud and as set forth in the proviso at the
end of this Section 9.5(e) and subject to Section 10.6, (i) if Parent receives
the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to Section 9.5(b), or if
the Company receives the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.5(c),
such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party
against (A) the paying party (B) any of the paying partys actual or potential
debt or equity financing sources (including, in the case of Parent or Merger
Sub, the Equity Investor and Debt Financing Sources), (C) any of the paying
partys or its financing sources Subsidiaries or Affiliates and (D) any of
foregoings respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
incorporators, controlling persons, stockholders, equityholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or other
Representatives or any of their respective successors or permitted assigns
(with respect to any party, (B)-(D) of the foregoing, collectively, the "
_Related Parties_ "), and none of the paying party or any of its Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation, in each case relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the termination thereof (and if the
paying party is Parent or Merger Sub, the Limited Guarantee or the Financing
Commitments) or the transactions contemplated hereby (or thereby) (or the
failure of such transactions to occur for any reason or for no reason) and
none of the receiving party or any of its Related Parties shall seek to
recover any other damages or seek any other remedy, whether based on a claim
at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any
losses or damages suffered in connection with this Agreement, the Limited
Guarantee or the Financing Commitments or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith, (ii) if (A) Parent receives any payments from the Company in
respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent receives the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.5(b) or (B) the Company receives
any payments from Parent in respect of any breach of this Agreement and
thereafter the Company receives the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section
9.5(c), the amount of such Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee,
as applicable, shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments made
by the party paying the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, in respect of any such breaches and (iii) in no event shall Parent
or its Related Parties be subject to (nor shall the Company or any of its
Related Parties seek to recover) monetary damages in excess of an amount equal
to the Parent Termination Fee, in the aggregate, for any losses or other
liabilities arising out of or in connection with breaches 

 



72

    

 by Parent of its representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement or arising from any claim or cause of action that
the Company or any of its Related Parties may have; _provided_ , that in each
of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the receiving party shall also
be entitled to seek and recover accrued interest pursuant to the last sentence
of Section 9.5(f), and reimbursement of expenses or indemnification pursuant
to Section 7.6(e).

(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
this Section 9.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into
this Agreement. Each of the parties further acknowledges that the payment of
the amounts by the Company or Parent specified in this Section 9.5 is not a
penalty, but, in each case, is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, in the
circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Accordingly, if any party fails to promptly pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 9.5, such party shall also pay any costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the party entitled
to such payment in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement
that results in a judgment for such amount against the party failing to
promptly pay such amount. Any amount not paid when due pursuant to this
Section 9.5 shall bear interest from the date such amount is due until the
date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , _Eastern Edition_ in effect on the date of such payment.

 

(g) While the Company may pursue each of (i) a grant of specific performance
or other equitable relief under Section 10.6(c), (ii) monetary damages in the
case of Willful Breach of this Agreement or Fraud by Parent or Merger Sub and
(iii) the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under Section 9.5(c), any
recovery by the Company shall be subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.5(e) and under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both (i) a grant of specific performance to cause Parent
to consummate the Closing, and (ii) the Parent Termination Fee or monetary
damages in the case of Willful Breach of this Agreement or Fraud in connection
with this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, subject to the first sentence of
this Section 9.5(g), nothing in this Agreement shall limit the Companys,
Parents or Merger Subs remedies in the case of Fraud.

 

(h) _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Fraud_ " means, with respect to any Person, an actual and intentional fraud
with respect to any material statement in any representation or warranty set
forth in Article IV or in the certificates delivered pursuant to Section
8.2(a) and Section 8.3(a) with the intent to deceive another Person and
requires (a) a false representation of material fact, (b) knowledge that such
representation is false, (c) an intention to induce the party to whom such
representation is made to act or refrain from acting in reliance upon it, (d)
causing that party, in justifiable reliance upon such false representation,
to take or refrain from taking action, and (e) causing such party to suffer
damage by reason of such reliance.

 



73

    

" _Willful Breach_ " means, with respect to any representation, warranty,
agreement or covenant set forth in this Agreement, an intentional action or
omission by a party that both (a) causes such party to be in material breach
of such representation, warranty, agreement or covenant and (b) such party
actually knows, or after reasonable due inquiry should have known, at the time
of such intentional action or omission is or would constitute a material
breach, or would reasonably be expected to result in a material breach,
of such representation, warranty, agreement or covenant; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of a party to consummate the Merger
when the relevant conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VIII of this
Agreement have been satisfied and such party is obligated to effectuate the
Closing pursuant to Section 1.2 will, in and of itself, constitute a Willful
Breach.

a waiver of such rights and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
no single or partial exercise by any party of any of its rights hereunder
precludes any other or further exercise of any such rights or any other rights
hereunder or under applicable Laws.

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages
would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, subject to the other
terms of this Agreement, including clause (d) below, each party agrees that
in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement (including the obligation
of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to pay and the Companys
stockholders right to receive the aggregate consideration payable to them
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement),

that may be available to it whether at law or in equity, including monetary
damages) to (i) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (ii) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. In the event that
any action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement,
no party shall allege, and each party hereby waives the defense or
counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. Each party further agrees that no other party or any other Person
shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 10.6, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.

hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall only be entitled to

Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the Closing in accordance with Article I, if, (i) the
Condition Satisfaction has occurred, (ii) the financing provided for by the
Debt Commitment Letter has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (iii) at or following the Condition
Satisfaction, the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that
the Company stands ready, willing and able to proceed with the Closing, if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded and (iv) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the
Merger by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
Section 1.2.

Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so

unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision,

they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation".

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. 

(c) The Company Disclosure Letter may include items and information the
disclosure of which is not required either in response to an express
disclosure requirement contained in a provision of this Agreement or as an
exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in Article IV
or to one or more covenants contained in Article V or Article VII. Inclusion

affect the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement.

expressly stated.

States dollars, unless otherwise specifically noted.

 

Section 10.14 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by
operation of law or otherwise, except that Parent may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to any (i) Debt Financing Sources as collateral in respect of the Debt
Financing or (ii) other Person after the Closing, and Merger Sub may transfer
or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from
time to time in part, to any (i) Debt Financing Sources as collateral in
respect of the Debt Financing or (ii) a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; 
_provided_ that such transfer or assignment shall not (i) relieve Parent or
Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any
obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger Sub or (ii)
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby or impose any additional obligations on the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates (including in respect
of required consents or approvals or governmental filing obligations). Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

Section 10.15 _Non-Recourse; Limitation on Liability; Waiver of Claims_.

(a) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim, action, suit
or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may
only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as parties
hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein
with respect to such party, except for claims that the Company may assert in
accordance with the Limited Guarantee or Equity Commitment Letter.
Without limiting the rights of the Company against Parent and Merger Sub, in
no event shall the Company or any of its Related Parties seek to enforce this
Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or
seek to recover monetary damages from, any of Parents or Merger Subs
Related Parties (other than in accordance with the Limited Guarantee or Equity
Commitment Letter).

 



81

behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Representatives and the Companys Related Parties and each of their
successors or permitted assigns) hereby waives any rights or claims against
all Debt Financing Sources in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letters, the Debt Financing, the definitive financing agreements
for the Debt Financing, or in respect of any other document or theory of law
or equity (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect of any oral
or written representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith
or therewith and the Company (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Representatives and its Related
Parties and each of their successors or permitted assigns) agrees not to
commence any action or proceeding against any Debt Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt
Financing, the definitive financing agreements for the Debt Financing, or in
respect of any other document or theory of law or equity and agrees to cause
any such action or proceeding asserted by the (on behalf of itself and any of

assigns) in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Debt Financing, the definitive financing agreements for the Debt Financing,
or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity against any

or damages to the Company any of its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Representatives and the Companys Related Parties and each
of their successors or permitted assigns, in connection with this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing, the definitive financing
agreements for the Debt Financing, or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Without limiting the foregoing, the Debt Financing Sources shall be
beneficiaries of all limitations on remedies and damages in this Agreement
that apply to Parent or Merger Sub hereto and are express third party
beneficiaries of this Section 10.15.

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

OF

1\. The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was originally filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 2, 2012. The
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on September 24, 2013
(the " _Amended Certificate_ ").

2\. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation has been duly adopted in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

3\. The text of the Amended Certificate is hereby amended and restated to
read in its entirety as follows:

FIRST. The name of the Corporation is Pattern Energy Group Inc. 

SECOND. The registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is

19808. The name of the Corporations registered agent at that address is

THIRD. The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the DGCL or any
successor statute.

FOURTH. The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the
Corporation is authorized to issue is [●] shares. The Corporation is
authorized to issue two classes of shares, designated "Common Stock" and

The following is a statement of the designations and the powers, privileges
and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof in
respect of each class of capital stock of the Corporation.

   

A. COMMON STOCK

 

1\. _General_. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of
the Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and
preferences of the holders of the Preferred Stock set forth herein.

2\. _Voting_. The holders of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote for
each share of Common Stock held at all meetings of stockholders (and written
actions in lieu of meetings); _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as
otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be
entitled to vote on any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or to a
Preferred Stock Designation that relates solely to the terms of one or more
outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series
are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more
other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to the Certificate of
Incorporation or a Preferred Stock Designation or pursuant to the DGCL.
Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the
number of authorized shares of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be
increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting
power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of
the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, and no vote of the holders of
either the Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class
shall be required therefor.

B. PREFERRED STOCK

stockholder approval, by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law
of the State of Delaware (the " _Preferred Stock Designation_ "), setting
forth such resolution and, with respect to each such series, establishing the
number of shares to be included in such series, and fixing the voting powers,
full or limited, or no voting power of the shares of such series, and the
designation, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other
special rights, if any, of the shares of each such series and any
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The powers, designation,
preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of
each series of Preferred Stock, and the qualifications, limitations and

all as may be determined from time to time by the Board and stated in the
resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such Preferred Stock.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the resolutions providing
for issuance of any series of Preferred Stock may provide that such series
shall be superior or rank equally or be junior to any other series of
Preferred Stock to the extent permitted by law. Any shares of Preferred Stock
which may be redeemed, purchased or acquired by the Corporation may be
reissued except as otherwise provided by law.

FIFTH. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the
laws of the State of Delaware, the board of directors, acting by majority
vote, is expressly authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal, in whole or in
part, the bylaws of the Corporation.

 

SIXTH. Unless and except to the extent that the bylaws of the Corporation
shall so require, election of directors of the Corporation need not be by
written ballot.

   

SEVENTH.

 

A. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, a director of the Corporation
shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty owed to the Corporation or its
stockholders.

B. Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article SEVENTH, nor the adoption
of any provision of, or any other amendment to, this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, nor, to the fullest extent permitted by the
DGCL, any modification of law, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely
affect any right or protection of a current or former director of the
Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal, adoption or
modification.

 

C. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the liability of directors, then a director of the Corporation shall
be free of liability to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so
amended.

D. This Article SEVENTH shall not limit or exclude any rights, indemnities or
limitations of liability to which any director of the Corporation may be
entitled, whether as a matter of law, under the bylaws of the Corporation, by
agreement, by vote of the stockholders, approval of the directors of the
Corporation or otherwise.

EIGHTH. The Corporation hereby expressly elects not to be governed by Section
203 of the DGCL, and the restrictions contained in Section 203 of the DCGL
shall not apply to the Corporation.

NINTH. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (A)
any "internal corporate claim" within the meaning of the DGCL and (B) (i) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any
action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other
wrongdoing by, any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to
the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any action asserting
a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Corporations bylaws (as either
may be amended and/or restated from time to time), (iv) any action to
interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Corporations bylaws (as either
may be amended and/or restated from time to time), or (v) any action asserting
a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to
said court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named
as defendants therein; provided, that, if and only if the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction, such action may be brought in another state court sitting in the
State of Delaware. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or
entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital
stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to
the provisions of this Article NINTH.

   

TENTH. If any provision or provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as
applied to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity,
legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and
of the remaining provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, without
limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation
to protect its directors, officers, employees and agents from personal
liability in respect of their good faith service or for the benefit of the
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.
