holders of Company Common Stock, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by
the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted in the Merger (the &#147;<U>Exchange

such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund,

promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with
respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level
required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under <U>Section&nbsp;4.1(a)</U>, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such aggregate payments under <U>Section&nbsp;4.1(a)</U>.
