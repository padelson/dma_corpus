(c) _Conversion of Warrants_

(i) At the Effective Time, the TICC Warrant which represents 100% of the
issued and outstanding warrants or options to purchase Company Common Stock as

Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall
be assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 2.01(c).

(ii) The TICC Warrant shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions set forth in the agreements which govern the TICC Warrant
in existence immediately prior to the Effective Time. Pursuant to the
provisions of such agreements, the holder of the TICC Warrant shall have
the right to acquire and receive, upon exercise of the TICC Warrant (i) that
number of shares of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the amount calculated as
follows: (the number of shares that constitute the Stock Consideration as
calculated pursuant to Section 2.01(b) hereof ÷ .96) × .04 and (ii) $1,400,000
of cash.

(iii) Parent shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the TICC Warrant assumed by
Parent under this Agreement.

(d) _Certificates for Shares_. Upon surrender of certificates representing
the Shareholders shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in
Section 2.02 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
delivery of an affidavit (and indemnity, if required) in the manner provided
in Section 2.04 (i) a certificate representing the Stock Consideration (other

(ii) a certificate representing the Escrow Shares shall be issued to
the Shareholder and delivered into escrow pursuant to Section 2.07 and the
Escrow Agreement.

(e) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratios_. The number of shares of Parent Common
Stock that Shareholder is entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Parent Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.



 

\- 4 - (f) _Tax Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
because, as set forth in Section 2.05, the parties hereto intend that the
Transaction shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, in the event that the aggregate Market Value of the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock determined pursuant to Section 2.01(b) is
less than 40 percent of the sum of (x) the Market Value of the Total Merger
Consideration and (y) the aggregate amount of all Permitted Distributions paid
or payable to the Shareholder contemporaneously with the Closing (the
"40-Percent Amount"), the Shareholder shall have the right, exercisable in his
sole discretion on or prior to the Closing Date, to elect to increase (but not
decrease) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock
Consideration, and to decrease (but not increase) the Cash Consideration by an
amount equal to the product of (i) the number of such additional shares of
Parent Common Stock and (ii) the quotient of A divided by B where A and B
have the values set forth in Section 2.01(b) above (and proportionately to
increase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock and to decrease the
amount of cash to which the holder of the TICC Warrant is entitled upon
exercise), provided that (i) the aggregate Market Value of the Stock
Consideration and the Cash Consideration as so adjusted does not exceed the
Market Value of the Total Merger Consideration to which the Shareholder would
otherwise be entitled, (ii) the aggregate Market Value of the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of cash, as so adjusted, to which
the holder of the TICC Warrant is entitled upon exercise does not exceed the
aggregate Market Value of the shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of
cash to which the holder of the TICC Warrant would otherwise be entitled upon
exercise, and (iii) the right of the Shareholder under this Section 2.01(f) to
increase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be received in the
Transaction may be exercised only insofar as may be necessary to ensure that
the aggregate Market Value of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received
by the Shareholder in the Transaction will equal (but not exceed) the
40-Percent Amount. For purposes of this Section 2.01(f) only, the _"Market
Value"_ of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed to be equal to the
average reported closing price for a share of Parent Common Stock for the
three trading days ending on the last trading day immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and any determination of the Market Value of the Total Merger
Consideration or the Stock Consideration shall be based on such value. 



   Section | 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. 
---|--- 

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. Upon the surrender of certificates representing
the Shareholders shares of Company Common Stock at the Closing, the
Shareholder shall receive in exchange therefore certificates representing the
Stock Consideration, less the Escrow Shares, and the Cash Consideration. The
certificates representing the Shareholders shares of Company Common Stock
shall be cancelled upon surrender. Until so surrendered, the Shareholders
shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Total Merger Consideration.

(b) _Transfers of Ownership_. If certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Shareholders shares of Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefore
are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
certificates of Company Common Stock so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Shareholder will have
paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Tax
required solely by reason of the



 

\- 5 - issuance of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the certificates of Company
Common Stock so surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or
any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

Section 2.03 _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock_. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Other than shares presented to the Surviving Corporation by the Shareholder in
connection with the Transaction, if, after the Effective Time, certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled for no consideration.

Section 2.04 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
of the Shareholders certificates of Company Common Stock shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificates of Company Common Stock, upon making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Shareholder, the certificates representing the
Stock Consideration; provided, however, that, as a condition precedent to the
issuance of such certificates representing the Stock Consideration, the
Shareholder shall indemnify Parent against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the certificates of
Company alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 2.05 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the
Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan
of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

Section 2.06 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_ If, at any time

Section 9.01 _Survival_. All representations, warranties, covenants, and
obligations of the Shareholder, the Company and Parent contained in this
Agreement and the Disclosure Letters, and the certificates delivered by the
Shareholder, Company and Parent pursuant to _Article VII_, shall survive the
Closing. Any and all claims for indemnification under _Section 9.02_ must be
made prior to the date eighteen (18) months following the Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , that the representations and warranties in _Sections 3.03_
(Capital Structure) and _3.04_ (Title to Company Common Stock) and any and all
claims based upon fraud or willful misconduct shall survive indefinitely;
_further provided, however,_ that the representations and warranties in
_Section 3.11_ (Taxes) shall survive for the applicable statute of
limitations and shall terminate thirty (30) days after the expiration of such
statute of limitations period; _further provided, however_ , that the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.05_ (Authority; Execution and
Delivery), _Section 3.07(a)(B)(iv) and (vi)_ (No Conflicts; Consents),
_Section 3.19(f)(iii)_ (Government Contracts) and _Section 3.12_ (Benefit

representations and warranties in _Section 4.07_ (Taxes) shall survive for
the applicable statute of limitations and shall terminate thirty (30 days
after the expiration of such statute of limitations period. In the event
notice of any claim for indemnification under _Section 9.02_ or _Section
9.03_ shall have been given prior to the end of the applicable date
referenced above (the _"Claims Period"_ ), such indemnification claim may be
pursued until such time as such claim is finally resolved, and _further
provided, however_ , that this  _Section 9.01_ shall not limit any covenant
or obligation of the parties contained in this Agreement or the right to
pursue any claim for breach of such covenant or obligation, which by its terms
contemplates performance or continued performance after the Claims Period.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, all covenants and
obligations of the Shareholder, the Company and Parent which by their terms
contemplate performance after the Closing Date or after termination of this
Agreement shall survive pursuant to their respective terms.

Section 9.02 _Indemnification and Payment of Damages by the Company and the
Shareholder_. Parent and its directors, officers, stockholders, accountants,
agents and employees, affiliates and their respective heirs, successors and
assigns (each a " _Parent Indemnified Party_ ") shall be fully indemnified,
held harmless and reimbursed from and against any and all proceedings,
charges, complaints, judgments, damages, dues, penalties, fines, costs,
amounts paid in settlement, liabilities, Taxes, Liens, losses, expenses and
fees, including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses
(collectively, " _Damages_ ") by the Shareholder (or by the Company and the
Shareholder jointly and severally for claims arising out of the failure to
consummate the Transaction), caused by or arising, directly or indirectly,
out of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company or the Shareholder in this Agreement, the Shareholder and Company
Disclosure Letter, or any other certificate delivered by the Company or the
Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement;



 

\- 60 - (b) any breach by the Company or the Shareholder of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or the Lock-Up Letter; and

(c) enforcing the Parent Indemnified Parties indemnification rights provided
for hereunder.

Section 9.03 _Indemnification and Payment of Damages by Parent_. After the
Closing, the Shareholder and his heirs, successors and assigns (each a
"Shareholder Indemnified Party") shall be fully indemnified, held harmless and
reimbursed from and against any and all Damages by Parent caused by or
arising, directly or indirectly, out of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Parent in this Agreement, the Parent Disclosure Letter, or any other
certificate delivered by Parent pursuant to this Agreement; and

(b) any breach by Parent of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or the Lock-Up Letter; and

(c) enforcing the Shareholder Indemnified Parties indemnification rights
provided for hereunder.

Section 9.04 _Indemnification Process_. The party or parties making a claim
for indemnification under this _Article IX_ shall be, for purposes of this
Agreement, referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ " and the party or parties
against whom such claims are asserted under this _Article IX_ shall be, for
purposes of this Agreement, referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_." The
Parent, the Shareholder and the Company acknowledge that all actions to be
taken on behalf of a Parent Indemnified Party shall be taken on its behalf by
the Committee in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. All claims by any Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) In the event that (i) any proceeding is asserted or instituted by any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement that could give rise
to Damages for which an Indemnifying Party could be liable to an Indemnified
Party under this Agreement (such proceeding, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") or
(ii) any Indemnified Party under this Agreement shall have a claim to
be indemnified by any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement that does not
involve a Third Party Claim (such claim, a " _Direct Claim_ " and with the
Third party Claims, sometimes collectively referred to herein as, a " _Claim_
"), the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness send to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature
of such Third Party Claim or Direct Claim and the amount or estimated amount
thereof, which amount or estimated amount shall not be conclusive of the final
amount, if any, of such Third Party Claim or Direct Claim (a " _Claim Notice_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder unless such
failure shall materially prejudice the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
such Claim.



 

\- 61 - (b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will have the
right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its
choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party at any time within 15
days after the Indemnifying Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim;
_provided , however_ , that the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-
counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim, _further provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
shall bear the cost and expense of separate co-counsel retained by the
Indemnified Party if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Party
to represent the Indemnified Party would present such counsel with a conflict
of interest in respect of which a party refuses to grant an informed waiver
and consent, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed counsel to
represent the Indemnified Party within the 15 day time period specified above,
or (iii) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation. So long
as the Indemnifying Party has assumed and is conducting the defense of the
Third Party Claim, (a) the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of
any judgment on, or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to
be unreasonably withheld) unless the judgment or proposed settlement involves
only the payment of money damages by one or more of the Indemnifying Parties
and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the
Indemnified Party, does not impose any future obligation on the Indemnified
Party, and includes as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party a release from all liability in
respect of the Third Party Claim, and (b) the Indemnified Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld). In the event that any
Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party settles or compromises or consents to
the entry of any judgment with respect to any Third Party Claim in violation
of the preceding sentence, then such violating party shall pay and indemnify
fully, hold harmless, and defend the other party against any incremental
Damages under this _Article IX_ caused by or arising from such settlement,
compromise or consent to the entry of judgment.

(c) In the event of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following receipt of a Claim Notice
whether or not the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim. If the Indemnifying
Party does not respond within such thirty (30) days, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have accepted responsibility for the Damages set forth in
such notice and shall have no right to further contest the validity of such
notice. If the Indemnifying Party responds within such thirty (30) days after
receipt of the notice and rejects such claim in whole or in part, the
Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to
it under contract or applicable Law.

(d) In addition to (and not in limitation of) the cooperation contemplated by
_Section 9.03(b)_, from and after the delivery of a Claim Notice relating to
a Third Party Claim, at the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each
Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its representatives
reasonable access to the books, records, personnel and properties of
such Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the matters to
which the Third Party Claim relates. All such access shall be granted during
normal business hours and shall be granted under conditions that will not
interfere with the business and operations of such Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, and shall require its representatives to not,
use (except in connection with such Third Party Claim) or disclose to any
third party other than the Indemnifying Partys representatives (except as
may be required by applicable Law) any information obtained pursuant to this
_Section 9.03(d)_.



 

\- 62 - (e) Parent shall provide the Shareholder with prior written notice ("Parent
Payment Notice") at least five (5) business days prior to its payment of any
Claim determined to be payable by Parent to the Shareholder hereunder
("Payable Parent Claim"). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, and subject to applicable Law and the availability of authorized
shares of Parent Common Stock to satisfy the election, the Shareholder shall
have the right (but not the obligation) to receive shares of Parent Common
Stock in lieu of cash in satisfaction of such Payable Claim, and shall notify
Parent of his election to exercise such right within ten (10) business days of
his receipt of any Parent Payment Notice. In the event the Shareholder elects
to receive Parent Common Stock in satisfaction of a Payable Parent Claim,
such shares of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at their fair market value,
as such term is defined in the Escrow Agreement.



   Section | 9.05 _Limitation on Indemnity Payments_. 
---|--- 

__(a) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, no Claim
payable by the Shareholder (or the Company prior to Closing) pursuant to this
_Article IX_ shall be required until the aggregate amount of Damages incurred
by a Parent Indemnified Party exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Shareholder
Deductible_ "); provided, however, that the Claim payable by the Shareholder
(and/or the Company prior to the Closing) shall only include such Damages as
exceed the Shareholder Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Shareholder Deductible shall not apply to any Claims based upon: (i) breach of
any covenants or other obligations contained herein, (ii) breach of
the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.03_ (Capital
Structure), _Section 3.04_ (Title to Company Common Stock), _Section 3.05_
(Authority; Execution and Delivery), _Sections 3.07(a)(B)(iv) and (vi)_ (No
Conflicts; Consents), _Section 3.11_ (Taxes), _Section 3.19(f)(iii)_
(Government Contracts), _Section 3.12_ (Benefit Plans), and (iii) fraud or
willful misconduct. Clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are collectively referred to
herein as the _"Shareholder Carve-Out Indemnification Obligations."_

(b) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, no Claims
payable by Parent pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be required until the
aggregate amount of Damages incurred by the Shareholder Indemnified Parties
exceeds $100,000 (the _"Parent Deductible"_ ); provided, however, that the
Claims payable by the Parent shall only include such Damages as exceed the
Parent Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Deductible shall
not apply to any Claims based upon: (i) breach of any covenants or other
obligations contained herein, (ii) breach of the representations and
warranties contained in _Section 4.03_ (Capital Structure), _Section 4.04(a)
and (c)_ (Authority; Execution and Delivery), _Section 4.05_ (No Conflicts;
Consents), _Section 4.07_ (Taxes) and _Section 4.10_ (Trust Funds;
Liquidation) and (iii) fraud or willful misconduct. Clauses (i), (ii), and
(iii) are collectively referred to herein as the _"Parent Carve-Out
Indemnification Obligations."_

(c) Subject to the Shareholders right to substitute cash for the Escrow
Shares as set forth in the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Shares shall be the
exclusive source from which the Parent Indemnified Parties may seek to satisfy
the indemnification obligations of the Shareholder under this _Article IX_
(other than the Shareholder Carve-Out Indemnity Obligations) and in no



 

\- 63 - event shall the aggregate liability of the Shareholder (or the Company if the
Closing does not occur) under this  _Article IX_ (other than the Shareholder
Carve-Out Indemnification Obligations) exceed the Escrow Shares. In no event
shall the aggregate liability of the Shareholder (or the Company if the
Closing does not occur) under this _Article IX_  (including the Shareholder
Carve-Out Indemnification Obligations) exceed the Total Merger Consideration.
In no event shall the aggregate liability of Parent under this _Article IX_
exceed $25,000,000.

Section 9.06 _Calculations of Amounts; Other Limitations_. The amounts for
which an Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this _Article IX_ shall be
net of (i) any specific provision or specific reserve established solely for
the matter to which the claim relates made in the Company Financial
Statements, (ii) any amounts received by the Indemnified Party under any third
party insurance policy in respect of such Damages, (iii) any amounts actually
received by the Indemnified Party in respect of claims under any third party
indemnification agreements and (iv) the amount of any Tax benefits actually
realized by the Indemnified Party resulting from the matter giving rise to
the indemnification claim. Without prejudice to the rights of any Indemnified
Party, if any Damages sustained by an Indemnified Party are covered by an
insurance policy, the Parent Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect such insurance. Upon making payment in full in
respect of any claim for indemnification, the Indemnifying Party shall, to the
extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the claiming party
against any third party in respect of such claim. All indemnification payments
made pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be deemed to be adjustments to the
Total Merger Consideration and, to the extent such payments are taxable to
the recipient, the amount of such payments shall be increased so that the
recipient will receive on an after-tax basis the full amount of
indemnification contemplated by this _Article IX_.

Section 9.07 _Effect on Liability_.

Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 9.07_, neither (a) the
consummation of the Transaction, or (b) the delay or omission of any party to
exercise any of its rights under this Agreement, shall (i) affect the
liability of the parties to one another for any breach of this Agreement or
(ii) prevent any party from relying on the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement. The right to indemnification payment of Damages
or other remedy based on the breach of representations, warranties,
covenants, and obligations will not be affected by any investigation conducted
with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at
any time whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the Closing Date with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation,
_provided, however_ , that if the Transaction is consummated, then for any
breach of any representation, warranty, or any covenant or obligation to be
performed prior to Closing that the Shareholder or the Company on the one
hand, and Parent on the other hand becomes aware of, and notifies the non-
breaching party of prior to Closing (receipt of which by the non-breaching
party is evidenced in writing), the non-breaching party shall waive any right
to indemnification payment of Damages or other remedy based on such breach.

Section 9.08 _No Right of Contribution_. The Shareholder shall have no right
to seek contribution from Company or any Company Subsidiary or Surviving
Company to satisfy any claim made after Closing pursuant to this _Article
IX_.



 

\- 64 - Section 9.09 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of fraud or willful
misconduct, the provisions of this _ Article IX_ shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties from and after the Closing
with respect to this Agreement and the Transaction.
