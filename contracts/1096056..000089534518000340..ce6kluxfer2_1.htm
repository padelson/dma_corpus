Section 2.16 Guarantee

 

The Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees in favour of the
Company the due and  punctual performance by the Purchaser of each and every
of the Purchaser's covenants, obligations and undertakings hereunder,
including the payment of the aggregate Consideration payable to Shareholders
in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement,
which guarantee will remain in force until all such covenants, obligations and
undertakings have been satisfied in full and agrees to be jointly and
severally liable with the Purchaser for the truth,  accuracy and completeness
of all of the Purchaser's representations and warranties hereunder. The Parent
hereby agrees that its guarantee is continuing in nature and full and
unconditional, and no release or extinguishments of the Purchaser's 
liabilities (other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement),
whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, will affect the
continuing validity and enforceability of the Parent's guarantee. The Parent
hereby agrees that  the Company shall not have to proceed first against the
Purchaser in respect of any such matter before exercising its rights under
this guarantee against the Parent and the Parent agrees to be jointly and
severally liable with the Purchaser for  all guaranteed obligations as if it
were the principal obligor of such obligations. The Parent acknowledges that
the Company is relying on this Section 2.16 in entering into this Agreement.

 

Section 2.17 Alternative Transaction

 

In the event the Parent or the Purchaser concludes that it is necessary or
desirable to proceed  with another form of transaction (such as a take-over
bid or amalgamation) whereby the Parent or one of its affiliates would
effectively acquire all of the Shares within approximately the same time
periods and on economic terms and other terms  and conditions that would
provide Shareholders with a financial result equivalent to or better than the
terms presently contemplated by this Agreement and such transaction (i) would
not reasonably be expected to impair or delay the ability of the  Parent and
the Purchaser to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or
prevent or delay the consummation by the Parent and the Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated hereby), and (ii) would not impose any additional 
liabilities or obligations on the Company or any of its affiliates (including
Tax liabilities or obligations) (an "Alternative Transaction"),  the Company
agrees to support the completion of such Alternative Transaction in the same
manner as the Arrangement and shall otherwise fulfill its covenants contained
in this Agreement in respect of such Alternative Transaction. In the event
of  any proposed Alternative Transaction, any reference in this Agreement to
the Arrangement shall refer to the Alternative Transaction to the extent
applicable, all terms, covenants, representations and warranties of this
Agreement shall be and  shall be deemed to have been made in the context of
the Alternative Transaction and all references to dates and time periods
regarding the Arrangement, including the Effective Date, herein shall refer to
the date of closing of the transactions  contemplated by the Alternative
Transaction (as such date may be extended from time to time).

       (3)  |  

Investigations made by or on behalf of the Parent and the Purchaser, whether

---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (4)  |  

For greater certainty, the Parent and the Purchaser and their respective

Section 4.7 Financing

 

 

       (1)  |  

Each of the Parent and the Purchaser shall, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
proceeds of  the Debt Financing at Closing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter
and the Fee Letter, as  in effect on the date of this Agreement (subject to
the last sentence of this Section 4.7(1)), in accordance with its terms, (ii)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the
"Definitive Debt Agreements") consistent with the terms and conditions
contained therein and (iii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by the Parent,
obtain the  waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the
Purchaser and the Parent (as applicable) in the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Fee Letter and the Definitive Debt Agreements and otherwise comply with all of
its obligations  thereunder. In the event that all conditions contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter have been satisfied or waived
and the Parent is required to consummate the Closing pursuant to Section 2.9,
the Parent shall use  commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Financing
Source to fund its respective committed portion of the Debt Financing required
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay
related fees and expenses  at Closing. Neither the Parent nor the Purchaser
shall, without the prior written consent of the Company, permit any amendment
or modification to, or any waiver of any provision (including any remedy)
under, or replace (it being  understood that any Alternative Debt Financing
shall not be deemed a replacement for purposes of this sentence), the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter if such amendment, modification, or waiver
or replacement (w) adds new (or  adversely modifies any existing) conditions
to the consummation of the Debt Financing as compared to those in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter as in effect on the date of this
Agreement in a manner that would reasonably  be expected to prevent, impede
or materially delay the consummation of the Arrangement and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (x) reduces the aggregate amount
of the Debt Financing below the amount (taking into  account all other
available sources of funds) required to consummate the Arrangement and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses, or (y) would otherwise reasonably be expected to  prevent, impede
or materially delay the consummation of the Arrangement and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (2)  |  

In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions set out in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee
Letter,  and such portion is necessary for Purchaser to satisfy its payment
obligations hereunder and under the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter at
Closing, regardless of the reason therefor, each of the Parent and the
Purchaser will (i)  use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
alternative debt financing from the same or other source(s) (the "Alternative
Debt  Financing") (in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) on terms not less favorable in the aggregate
to the Parent than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee 
Letter that the Alternative Debt Financing would replace (taking into account
any flex provisions) and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such
unavailability and the reason therefor and the "commercially reasonable
efforts" described  in this Section shall not be deemed to require the
Purchaser or the Parent to incur any out-of-pocket expenses (other than its
own out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Debt Financing) in
connection therewith that are in  excess of those specified in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (3)  |  

For purposes of the foregoing Section 4.7(1) and Section 4.7(2), (i) the term
"Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter
(or  similar agreement) with respect to any Alternative Debt Financing
arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letters remaining in
effect at the time in question), (ii) the term "Fee Letter" shall be deemed to
include any  fee letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any
Alternative Debt Financing arranged in compliance with this Section 4.7 and
(iii) the term "Financing Sources" shall be deemed to include any financing
sources providing the  Alternative Debt Financing arranged in compliance
herewith. The Parent and the Purchaser shall keep the Company reasonably
informed of any actual material breach or default by any party to any Debt
Commitment Letters or the  Definitive Debt Agreements of which the Parent or
the Purchaser gains knowledge and termination or repudiation by any party to
any Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Debt Agreements or any provision
thereof.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (4)  |  

In the event that the need for an extension of the Outside Date becomes
reasonably foreseeable to allow for the condition in Section 6.1(4) or
Section  6.1(7) to be satisfied, the Parent shall promptly use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an extension to the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Fee Letter for the Debt Financing, provided that it is on terms
no less favorable  in the aggregate to the Parent, , or an Outside Date
Alternative Financing, in each case with an expiration date that would be
coterminous or later than such contemplated extension of the Outside Date.

Section 4.8 Pre-Acquisition Reorganization

 

 

       (1)  |  

The Company agrees that, upon request of the Purchaser, the Company shall
consider and evaluate, in its sole discretion, any proposed corporate
structure,  capital structure, business, operations and assets or such other
transactions, including amalgamation or liquidation, as the Purchaser may
request (each a "Pre-Acquisition Reorganization"), provided such Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization is mutually beneficial to the Parties.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (2)  |  

In the event that the Company agrees in writing with the Purchaser to
implement any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization, then the Purchaser agrees that
it will  be responsible for all direct and indirect costs and expenses
associated with any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization (including, for greater
certainty, any and all costs incurred by the Company in connection with a Pre-
Acquisition  Reorganization and all ancillary matters related thereto) and
shall indemnify and save harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective directors and officers from and against any and all direct and
indirect liabilities,  losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest
awards, judgements and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with or as a result of any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization
(including in respect of any  reversal, modification or termination of a Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization and including any out of pocket costs and expenses
for filing fees and external counsel and auditors which may be incurred) and
that any Pre-Acquisition  Reorganization will not be considered in
determining whether a representation or warranty of the Company under this
Agreement has been breached. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, no direct or  indirect costs incurred by the
Parent and/or the Purchaser in connection with any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization shall constitute expenses subject to reimbursement pursuant to
any Purchaser Reimbursement Payment contemplated in  Section 8.2(4) of this
Agreement.

Subsidiaries shall be required to: (i) pay any fees or costs associated with
the Debt  Financing or any other financing of or by the Purchaser or the
Parent (provided that if any such fees or expenses are incurred, the Parent

would,  or would be reasonably likely to:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (a)  |  

cause any of the representations or warranties of such Party contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time
from  the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time if such failure to be
true or accurate would cause any condition in Section 6.2(1)
[Company              Reps and Warranties Conditions] or Section
6.3(1) [Purchaser and Parent Reps and Warranties Conditions], as applicable, 
to not be satisfied; or

    | (b)  |  

result in the failure to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied
with by such Party under this Agreement if such failure to comply would

---|---|---

Notification provided under this Section 4.11 will not affect the

Parties (or  remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. In addition, the failure by
any Party to provide a notification pursuant to Section 4.11(1) shall not be
considered in  determining whether any condition in Section 6.2, Section
6.3(1) or Section 6.3(2) has been satisfied.

       (3)  |

Party") has delivered a written notice ("Termination Notice") to the
applicable other Party (the "Breaching Party") specifying in reasonable detail
all breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or other matters
which the Terminating Party  asserts as the basis for termination. After
delivering a Termination Notice, provided the Breaching Party is proceeding
diligently to cure such matter and such matter is capable of being cured prior
to the Outside Date (with any  Willful Breach being deemed to be incurable),
the Terminating Party may not exercise such termination right until the
earlier of (a) the Outside Date, and (b) the date that is thirty (30) days
following receipt of such Termination  Notice by the Breaching Party, if such
matter has not been cured by such date. If the Terminating Party delivers a
Termination Notice prior to the date of the Company Meeting, unless the
Parties mutually agree otherwise, the Company  shall postpone or adjourn the
Company Meeting to the earlier of (a) five (5) Business Days prior to the
Outside Date and (b) the date that is ten (10) Business Days following receipt

Section 5.3 Responding to an Acquisition Proposal

 

Notwithstanding Section 5.1, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Required
Shareholder Approval,  the Company receives an unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal, the Company and its Representatives may engage in or
participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding such
Acquisition Proposal and, subject to entering into a  confidentiality and
standstill agreement with such Person containing confidentiality, standstill
and other terms that are no less favourable to the Company in the aggregate
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and which do not 
restrict the Company from complying with this Article 5 (it being understood
and agreed that such confidentiality and standstill agreement need not
restrict the making of a confidential Acquisition Proposal and related
communications to the  Company or the Board), the Company and its
Representatives may provide copies of, access to or disclosure of information,
properties, facilities, books or records of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(provided that the Company provides a copy of  such confidentiality and
standstill agreement to the Purchaser prior to providing such Person with any
such copies, access or disclosure and makes such information available to the
Parent substantially simultaneously to the extent such  information was not
previously made available to the Parent), if and only if:

 

 

       
    | (a)  |  

the Board first determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal 
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to a
Superior Proposal and, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the
failure to engage in such discussions our negotiations would be inconsistent
with its  fiduciary duties;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (b)  |  

such Person was not restricted from making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant
to an existing confidentiality, standstill, non-disclosure, use, business 
purpose or similar restriction with the Company or its Subsidiaries;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (c)  |  

the Acquisition Proposal did not arise, directly or indirectly, as a result of
a violation by the Company of this Article 5 or by the OCM Shareholders of 
the Company Support and Voting Agreements; and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (d)  |  

the Company has been, and continues to be, in compliance with its obligations
under Article 5 in all material respects.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

Section 5.4 Right to Match

 

 

       (1)  |  

If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior
Proposal prior to obtaining the Required Shareholder Approval, the Board may,
or  may cause the Company to make a Change in Recommendation and, subject to
compliance with Section 8.2(3), terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.2(1)(c)(ii) in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such  Superior Proposal, if and only if:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (a)  |  

the Company has been, and continues to be, in compliance with its obligations
under Article 5 in all material respects;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (b)  |  

the Acquisition Proposal did not arise, directly or indirectly, as a result of
a violation by the Company of this Article 5 or by the OCM Shareholders of 
the Company Support and Voting Agreements;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (c)  |  

the Company or its Representatives have delivered to the Purchaser a written
notice of the determination of the Board that such Acquisition Proposal 
constitutes a Superior Proposal and of the intention of the Board to enter
into such definitive agreement and make a Change in Recommendation, together
with a written notice from the Board regarding the value and financial terms
that  the Board, in consultation with its financial advisors, has determined
should be ascribed to any non-cash consideration offered under such
Acquisition Proposal (the "Superior Proposal Notice");

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (d)  |  

the Company or its Representatives have provided to the Purchaser a copy of
the proposed definitive agreement for the Superior Proposal (including any 
financing commitments or other documents containing material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal);

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (e)  |  

at least five (5) Business Days (the "Matching
Period")              have elapsed from the date that is the
later of the date on which the Purchaser received the Superior Proposal Notice
the date on which the Purchaser received and a copy of the proposed definitive
agreement for the Superior Proposal  from the Company (including any
financing commitments or other documents containing material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal);

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (f)  |  

during any Matching Period, the Purchaser has had the opportunity (but not the
obligation), in accordance with Section 5.4(2), to offer to amend this 
Agreement and the Arrangement in order for such Acquisition Proposal to cease
to be a Superior Proposal;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (g)  |  

after the Matching Period, the Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Acquisition  Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (and, if
applicable, compared to the terms of the Arrangement as proposed to be amended
by the Purchaser under Section 5.4(2)); and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (h)  |  

the Board has determined, in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Change in Recommendation 
and terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (2)  |  

During the Matching Period, or such longer period as the Company may approve
in writing for such purpose: (a) the Board shall, in good faith, review any 
offer made by the Purchaser under Section 5.4(1)(f) to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the Arrangement in order to determine whether such proposal
would, upon acceptance, result in the Acquisition Proposal previously 
constituting a Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal; and (b)
the Company shall negotiate in good faith with the Purchaser to make such
amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement as would enable
the  Purchaser to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on such amended terms. If the Board determines that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall promptly so
advise the  Purchaser and the Company and the Purchaser shall amend this
Agreement to reflect such offer made by the Purchaser, and shall take and
cause to be taken all such actions as are necessary to give effect to the
foregoing.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (3)  |  

Each successive amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that results in an
increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of such
consideration)  to be received by the Shareholders or other material terms or
conditions thereof shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the
purposes of this Section 5.4, provided that the Matching Period in respect of
such new Acquisition  Proposal shall extend only until the later of the end
of the initial five (5) Business Day Matching Period and 36 hours after the
Purchaser received the Superior Proposal Notice for the new Superior Proposal
and a copy of the proposed  definitive agreement for the new Superior
Proposal (including any financing commitments or other documents containing
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal).

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (4)  |  

If the Company provides a Superior Proposal Notice to the Purchaser on a date
that is less than ten (10) Business Days before the Company Meeting or if
the  Company Meeting is to be held during a Matching Period, the Company
shall either proceed with or shall postpone the Company Meeting, as directed
by the Purchaser acting reasonably, to a date that is not more than ten
Business Days  after the scheduled date of the Company Meeting but in any
event the Company Meeting shall not be postponed to a date which would prevent
the Effective Date from occurring on or prior to the Outside Date.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (5)  |  

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board from making any
disclosure to any securityholders of the Company prior to the Company
Meeting,  if, in the good faith judgment of the Board, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, failure to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with the Board's exercise of its fiduciary duties or disclosure
is otherwise required by  law; provided that the Purchaser and its counsel
shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
such disclosure and the Board shall give reasonable consideration to such
comments. In addition, nothing  contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Board from responding, within the time and in the manner required by
applicable Securities Laws, to any Acquisition Proposal by take-over or tender
or exchange offer made for the Shares  that it determines is not a Superior
Proposal; provided that the Purchaser and its counsel shall be provided with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such response and the
Board shall give reasonable consideration to  such comments. Nothing
contained in this Section 5.4(5) shall (a) permit the Board to make a Change
in Recommendation other than as permitted by Section 5.4 and (b) limit in any
way (i) the rights of the Purchaser pursuant to Section  7.2(1)(d)(ii) or
(ii) the obligations of the Company contained in this Agreement, including the
obligation to convene and hold the Company Meeting in accordance with Section
2.3.

Section 5.5 Breach by Subsidiaries and Representatives

 

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall advise its
Subsidiaries and its  Representatives of the prohibitions set out in this
Article 5 and any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Article 5 by
the Company, its Subsidiaries or Representatives is deemed to be a breach of
this Article 5 by the Company.

---|---|--- 
    

 

 

For purposes of the foregoing, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the

       (4)  |  

If this Agreement is terminated by either the Purchaser or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(b)(i) [Failure of Required Shareholder Approval],
the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) all reasonable documented expenses
incurred by the Parent and the Purchaser in connection  with this Arrangement
up to a maximum of $3,500,000 (the "Purchaser Reimbursement Payment") by wire
transfer in immediately  available funds to an account designated by the
Purchaser no later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such
termination; provided that in no event shall the Company be required to pay
under Section 8.2(2), on the one hand,  and this Section 8.2(4), on the other
hand, in the aggregate, an amount in excess of the Termination Fee.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (5)  |  

If this Agreement is terminated by:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (a)  |  

either the Purchaser or the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(b)(ii) [Failure
of Parent Resolution]; or

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (b)  |  

either the Purchaser or the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(b)(iv) [Outside
Date], if an extension to the Outside Date was requested in writing to allow
for the satisfaction of the condition in Section 6.1(4) or Section 6.1(7) and
such extension was not permitted due to  the application of the second
proviso in the definition of "Outside Date,"

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

then the Parent or the Purchaser shall pay (or cause to be paid) all
reasonable documented expenses  incurred by the Company in connection with
this Arrangement up to a maximum of $3,500,000 by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Company no later than two (2)
Business Days after the date of such  termination.

 

 

       (6)  |  

Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that  without these agreements the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement, and that any payments made pursuant to this Section 8.2 are made in
consideration for the disposition of the recipient's rights under this
Agreement, and that  the amounts set out in this Section 8.2 represent
liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages, including
opportunity costs, reputational damages and expenses, which the affected Party
or Parties will suffer or  incur as a result of the event giving rise to such
damages and resultant termination of this Agreement, and are not penalties.
Each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that
any such liquidated damages  are excessive or punitive. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to the
Purchaser's and the Parent's rights set forth in Section 8.5, in the event of
the termination of this Agreement by  the Purchaser or the Company in
circumstances that constitute a Termination Fee Event, the receipt of the
Termination Fee by the Purchaser shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
(including damages, specific performance and injunctive  relief) of the
Parent and the Purchaser and their respective affiliates against the Company,
its affiliates and any of their respective former, current or future
directors, officers, employees, affiliates, shareholders, managers,  members
or agents and the Financing Sources for all breaches of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby by the Company and the failure of the transactions 
contemplated herein to be consummated (including with respect to any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Arrangement to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, other than a Willful Breach).
For the  avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that the Company and the Purchaser
shall be entitled to pursue an injunction, or other form of specific
performance or equitable relief, solely as provided in Section 8.5.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (7)  |  

The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 8.2 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that 
without these agreements the Parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee when due and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Purchaser commences a suit that results in
a  judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall
pay to the Purchaser its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such or
portion  thereof at the prime rate of the Royal Bank of Canada in effect on
such date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

notice or other communication to a Party. 


 

 

Section 8.4 Time of the Essence

 

Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

 

Section 8.5 Injunctive Relief

 

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which money damages
would not be an  adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to injunctive and  other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to enforce
compliance with the terms of this Agreement, without any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of  any such
injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which the Parties may be entitled at law or in equity.

 

Section 8.6 Third Party Beneficiaries

 

 

       (1)  |  

Except as provided in Section 4.12 and the Financing Sources Sections which,
without limiting its terms, are intended as stipulations for the benefit of
the  third Persons mentioned in such provisions (such third Persons referred
to in this Section 8.6, including the Financing Sources, as the
"Third              Party Beneficiaries") and except for the
rights of the Affected Securityholders to receive the applicable consideration
following the Effective Time pursuant to the Arrangement (for which purpose
the Company hereby confirms  that it is acting as agent on behalf of the
Affected Securityholders), the Parties intend that this Agreement will not
benefit or create any right or cause of action in favour of any Person, other
than the Parties and that no Person,  other than the Parties, shall be
entitled to rely on the provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit,
proceeding, hearing or other forum.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (2)  |  

Despite the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge to each of the Third Party
Beneficiaries their direct rights against the applicable Party under Section
4.12,  which are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Third Party Beneficiary, his or her heirs and his or her legal
representatives, and for such purpose, the Company confirms that it is acting
as agent on their  behalf, and agrees to enforce such provisions on their
behalf.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (3)  |  

Each of the Parties acknowledges to each of the Financing Sources, as a Third
Party Beneficiary, their direct rights against it under the Financing
Sources  Sections, which are intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Financing Source, its heirs and its legal
representatives.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

Section 8.7 Waiver

 

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver
of any other  provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding
unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. A Party's
failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate
as a waiver of that right. A  single or partial exercise of any right will
not preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of that right or the
exercise of any other right.

 

Section 8.8 Entire Agreement

 

This Agreement, together with the Company Disclosure Letter, Parent and
Purchaser Disclosure Letter  and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral  or written, of
the Parties. There are no representations, warranties, covenants, conditions
or other agreements, express or implied, collateral, statutory or otherwise,
between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, 
except as specifically set forth in this Agreement. The Parties have not
relied and are not relying on any other information, discussion or
understanding in entering into and completing the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

Section 8.9 Successors and Assigns

 

 

       (1)  |  

This Agreement becomes effective only when executed by the Company, the Parent
and the Purchaser. After that time, it will be binding upon and enure to the 
benefit of the Company, the Parent and the Purchaser and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (2)  |  

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations under this
Agreement are assignable or transferable by any Party without the prior
written  consent of the other Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company (including on behalf of the Company Related Parties) agrees that the
Parent or the Purchaser (i) may assign all or any part of its rights under
this Agreement  to, and its obligations under this Agreement may be assumed
by, any of its affiliates, provided that it shall continue to be liable
jointly and severally with such affiliate for all of its obligations hereunder
(ii) may assign their  rights under this Agreement in whole or in part
without the prior written consent of the Company to the Financing Sources as
collateral security for the obligations of the Parent or the Purchaser to such
Financing Sources.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

Section 8.10 Severability

 

If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable by any  court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be
severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions shall remain in full
force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of  being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are  fulfilled to the fullest extent
possible. For greater certainty, if any provision of this Agreement or the
Plan of Arrangement is interpreted by a Securities Authority in a manner that
would result in the intentions set out in the Company Voting  and Support
Agreements with respect to the voting of the Shares subject to such Company
Voting and Support Agreements not being achieved, it will be deemed to be
incapable of being enforced to the extent necessary so that such intentions
can be  realized.

 

Section 8.11 Governing Law

 

 

       (1)  |  

This Agreement and any disputes relating to this Agreement and the transaction
contemplated thereby will be governed by and interpreted and enforced in 
accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of
Canada applicable therein.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (2)  |  

Each Party irrevocably attorns and submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
of the Ontario courts situated in the City of Toronto and waives objection
to  the venue of any proceeding in such court or that such court provides an
inconvenient forum.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       (3)  |  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of
the Parties (including the Company on behalf of the Company Related Parties) 
hereby agrees that (i) it will not bring or support an action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the  Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof,  in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in Federal courts, the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New  York (and appellate courts thereof) and (ii)
any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim

The Parent appoints the Purchaser as agent for the service of process in
Ontario in any legal proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions  contemplated hereby; provided that in the case of any such
service upon the Purchaser, the Party affecting such service shall also
deliver a copy thereof to the other Parties in the manner provided in Section
8.3. Nothing herein shall  affect the right of any Party to service process
in any manner permitted by applicable Law.

liability whatsoever  to the Company under this Agreement or any other
document delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby on
behalf of the Purchaser or the Parent. No director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall have any  personal liability whatsoever to

to be paid fair value for such Company Shares as set out in  this Section
3.1), as provided in Section 2.3(b)(i), (iv) and (v), and if they:

 

 

       
    | (a)  |  

ultimately are entitled to be paid fair value for their Company Shares: (i)
shall be deemed not to have participated in the transactions in Article 2
(other  than Section 2.3(b)(i), (iv) and (v)); (ii) will be entitled to be 
paid the fair value of such Company Shares by the Parent, which fair value,
notwithstanding anything contrary contained in Part XIV of the OBCA, shall be
determined as of the close of business on the Business Day before the 
Arrangement Resolution was adopted; and (iii) will not be entitled to any
other payment or consideration, including any Share Consideration or Cash

Recognition of Dissenting Holders

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (a)  |  

In no circumstances shall the Purchaser, the Parent or the Company or any
other Person be required to recognize a Person exercising Dissent Rights
unless  such Person is the registered holder of those Company Shares in
respect of which such rights are sought to be exercised.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (b)  |  

For greater certainty, in no case shall the Purchaser, the Parent or the
Company or any other Person be required to recognize any Dissenting Company 
Shareholders as holders of Company Shares in respect of which Dissent Rights
have been validly exercised after the completion of the step in Section
2.3(b)(i), (iv) and (v), and the names of such Dissenting Company Shareholders
shall be removed from the registers of holders of the Company  Shares in
respect of which Dissent Rights have been validly exercised at the same time
as the step described in Section 2.3(b)(i), (iv) and (v) occurs. In addition
to any other restrictions under Section 185 of the OBCA, none of the following
shall be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights: (i)  holders of any Company

dividends payable with respect to any Parent Shares allotted and issued
pursuant to this Arrangement for which a certificate has not been issued shall
be paid or  delivered to the Depositary to be held by the Depositary in trust
for the registered holder thereof. All monies received by the Depositary shall
be invested by it in interest-bearing trust accounts upon such terms as the

deliver to any such registered holder, as soon as reasonably practicable after
application therefor is made by the registered holder to the Depositary in
such form as the  Depositary may reasonably require, such dividends and any
interest thereon to which such holder is entitled, net of applicable
withholding and other taxes.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (c)  |  

Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding  Company Shares that were exchanged pursuant to Section
2.3(b)(ii), together with a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal
and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably
require, the Company  Shareholder represented by such surrendered
certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the
Depositary shall deliver to such Company Shareholder:

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (i)  |  

a certificate (or other evidence of entitlement) representing the number of 
Parent Shares to which such Company Shareholder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.3, which Parent Shares will be registered in such name or names and

less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.4,

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

and any certificate(s) representing Company Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith thereafter be  cancelled.

 

 

       
    | (d)  |  

As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Depositary shall deliver
to each former holder of Company DSUs, Company RSUs and Company PSUs, as 
applicable, a cheque (or other form of immediately available funds)
representing the cash amount to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.3, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.4.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (e)  |  

Any payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary (or the Company, if
applicable) pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement that has not been deposited
or  returned to the Depositary (or the Company) or that otherwise remains
unclaimed, in each case, on or before the second anniversary of the Effective
Date, and any right or claim to payment hereunder that remains outstanding on
the  second anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a
right or claim of any kind or nature and the right of the holder to receive
the applicable Consideration pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement shall
terminate and be  deemed to be surrendered and forfeited to the Purchaser (or
the Company, as applicable) for no consideration.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (f)  |  

After the Effective Date, certificates formerly representing Company Shares
which are held by a Company Shareholder, except for Company Shares held by 
Dissenting Company Shareholders in respect of which they have validly
exercised Dissent Rights pursuant to Section 3.1, will represent only the
right to receive the Consideration to which such Company Shareholder is
entitled pursuant  to Section 2.3 in accordance with the terms of this Plan
of Arrangement. Any such certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Date represented outstanding Company Shares and which has not been
surrendered, together with a  duly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal all other documents and instruments required by this Article 4, on
or prior to the second anniversary of the Effective Date, will cease to
represent any claim against or interest of  any kind or nature in the
Company, the Parent, the Purchaser or the Depositary. On such date, all
Consideration to which such former holder was entitled shall be deemed to have
been surrendered to the Purchaser and shall be returned  by the Depositary to
the Purchaser or as directed by the Purchaser.

    | (g)  |

dividends,  premium or other payment in connection therewith.

No Fractional Purchaser Shares and Rounding of Cash Consideration

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (a)  |  

In no event shall any fractional Purchaser Shares be issued under this Plan
of  Arrangement. Where the aggregate number of Purchaser Shares to be issued
to a Company Shareholder as consideration under this Plan of Arrangement 
would result in a fraction of a Purchaser Share being issuable, then the
number of Purchaser Shares to be issued to such Company Shareholder shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole Purchaser Share.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (b)  |  

If the aggregate cash amount which a Company Shareholder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(ii) would otherwise include a  fraction of
$0.01, then the aggregate cash amount which such Company Shareholder shall be
entitled to receive shall be rounded up to the nearest whole $0.01.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       4.3  |  

Lost Certificates

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more  outstanding Company Shares that were transferred
pursuant to Section 2.3 shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit or statutory declaration of that fact by the Person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen  or destroyed and who was listed
immediately prior to the Effective Time as the registered holder thereof on
the securities registers maintained by or on behalf of the Company, the
Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or  destroyed
certificate the Consideration that such holder has the right to receive in
accordance with Section 2.3 and such holder's Letter of Transmittal. When
authorizing such exchange for any lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate, the
Person to  whom such Consideration is to be shall, as a condition precedent
to the delivery of such Consideration, give a bond satisfactory to the Parent,
the Purchaser and the Depositary (each acting reasonably) in such sum as the
Parent, the Purchaser and  the Depositary may direct, or otherwise indemnify
the Parent, the Purchaser and the Depositary in a manner satisfactory to the
Parent, the Purchaser and the Depositary (each acting reasonably) against any
claim that may be made against Parent,  the Purchaser or the Depositary with
respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

 

       4.4  |  

Withholding Rights

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

The Parent, the Purchaser, the Company and the Depositary, as applicable,
shall be entitled to  deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable
or deliverable to any Person under this Plan of Arrangement or the Arrangement
Agreement, including to any Person exercising Dissent Rights, such amounts as
the Parent, the Purchaser, the  Company or the Depositary, as applicable, are
required to deduct and withhold, or reasonably believe to be required to
deduct and withhold, from such amount otherwise payable or deliverable under
any provision of any Laws in respect of Taxes. Any  such amounts will be
deducted, withheld and remitted from the amount otherwise payable or
deliverable pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement or the Arrangement Agreement
and shall be treated for all purposes under this Plan of Arrangement or the 
Arrangement Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction, withholding and remittance was made; provided that such
deducted and withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity. To  satisfy the amount required to be deducted or
withheld from any payment to any former holder of Company Shares or Company
Incentive Securities, the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or the
Depositary, as applicable, may sell or otherwise dispose  of any portion of
the Consideration payable to such holder as is necessary to provide sufficient
funds to enable the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or the Depositary, as
applicable, to comply with such deduction and/or withholding  requirements.

Calculations

    
---|---

in the Debt  Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter delivered to the Company,

obligations of the Financing Sources to provide the Debt Financing or any

case, that would adversely affect  or delay in any material respect the

Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter on or prior to the Closing.

    | (b)  |  

The Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required
to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee 
Letter on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such
amounts due on or before the Closing. The Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letter have not been modified, altered or amended on or prior to the date of 
this Agreement. None of the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter or
the Fee Letter have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded prior to the date
of this Agreement. Each of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter is
in  full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement and is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Parent (or the affiliate of the Parent
party thereto), enforceable against the Parent (or the affiliate of the Parent
party  thereto) and, to the knowledge of the Parent, each other party thereto
in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be
limited by the applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, 
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws from time to time in effect
affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies and
principles of equity.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | (c)  |  

The proceeds of the Debt Financing, if funded, together with available cash of
the Parent and its Subsidiaries, will constitute sufficient funds for the 
satisfaction of all of the Parent's and the Purchaser's obligations under this
Agreement at the Closing, including the payment of the Consideration and all
other amounts to be paid at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement and the 
payment of all associated costs and expenses of the Arrangement.

financial advisors, has: (i) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of
the  Parent vote in favour of the Parent Resolution; and (ii) authorized the
entering into of this Agreement and the performance by the Parent of its
obligations under this Agreement, and no action has been taken to amend, or
supersede,  such determinations, resolutions or authorizations.

Each of the directors and executive officers of the Parent has advised the
Parent and the Parent believes that they intend to vote or cause to be voted

become effective in respect of each Demand Registration in accordance with the
intended method of distribution set forth in the written request delivered by

with _Section 5.2(a)(i)_. As promptly as practicable, but no later than ten
(10) days after receipt of a  notice of a Demand Registration, the Company
shall give written notice thereof to all holders of record of Registrable
Securities other than the Demand Holder(s) making such request. The Company
shall include in such registration all  Registrable Securities with respect
to which the Company receives, within the ten (10) days immediately following
the receipt by the Stockholders of such notice from the Company, a request for
inclusion in the registration from the Stockholder  thereof. Each such
request from a Stockholder for inclusion in the Registration shall also
specify the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities proposed to be
registered.

registration,  the Stockholders shall be entitled to an additional Demand
Registration right to the extent the related Registration Statement is
withdrawn or otherwise not available for use for the sale of the Company
Securities covered thereby and (ii) a  Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down
shall be only counted as a request for a Demand Registration for purposes of
this _Section 5.1(b)_ if it is  actually consummated with respect to no less
than 75% of the amount of Company Securities requested to be included in such
Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down.

 

(c) RESERVED.

 

(d) The Company may include in any offering pursuant to a Demand Registration
other Equity Securities for sale for its own account  or for the account of
another Person (the " _Other Securities_ ") subject to the following sentence.
If the Registrable Securities and Other  Securities are to be sold in a
Demand Registration in a firm commitment underwritten offering and the
managing underwriters of such Demand Registration advise the Company in
writing that, in their good faith opinion, the number of Equity  Securities
proposed to be included in such Demand Registration exceeds the number of
securities that can reasonably be expected to be sold in such offering without
being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution
of  securities offered or the market for the securities offered, then there
shall be included in such offering the number or dollar amount of Registrable
Securities that in the good faith opinion of such managing underwriters can be
sold without so  adversely affecting such offering, and such number of
Registrable Securities shall be allocated for inclusion as follows: (A)
_first_ , the  Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Demand
Registration by the Demand Holder and, if different, any Stockholder who was a
Stockholder as of the Effective Time, pro rata (B) _second_ , the Registrable
Securities for which inclusion in such Demand Registration was requested by
the other holders of Registrable Securities, pro rata, and (C) _third_ , Other
Securities requested to be included in such Demand Registration to the extent
permitted hereunder allocated among the Company and the  respective holders
of such Other Securities, as applicable, as determined by the Company and such
holders.

 

(e) (A) The Company shall not be obligated to effect (i) any Demand
Registration within one hundred twenty (120) after the effective  date of any
other registration statement of the Company (unless such Demand Registration
is a Short-Form Registration pursuant to _Section 5.1(g)_ ,  in which case
the Company shall not be obligated to effect such Short-Form Registration
within ninety (90) days after the effective date of any other registration
statement of the Company); or (B) if the Board, in its good faith judgment, 
determines that any registration of Registrable Securities should not be made
or continued because it would materially interfere with any existing or
potential material financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization, merger,
share exchange or  other transaction or event involving the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, because the Company does not yet have appropriate financial
statements of acquired or to be acquired entities available for filing or
because the Company has material,  confidential information that may be
required to be disclosed in a registration statement and which the Board deems
reasonably inappropriate to disclose at such time (in each case, a " _Valid
Business Reason_ "), then (x) the Company may postpone filing a registration
statement relating to a Demand Registration until five (5) Business Days after
such Valid Business Reason no longer  exists, but in no event for more than
sixty (60) days after the date the Board determines a Valid Business Reason
exists and (y) in case a registration statement has been filed relating to a
Demand Registration, the Company may, to the extent  determined in the good
faith judgment of the Board to be reasonably necessary to avoid interference
with any of the transactions described above, suspend use of or, if required
by the SEC, cause such registration statement to be withdrawn and  its
effectiveness terminated or may postpone amending or supplementing such
registration statement until five (5) Business Days after such Valid Business
Reason no longer exists, but in no event for more than sixty (60) days after
the date the  Board determines a Valid Business Reason exists (such period of
postponement or withdrawal under this clause (ii), the " _Postponement Period_
").  The Company shall give written notice to the Stockholders of its
determination to postpone filing or suspend use of or withdraw a registration
statement and of the fact that the Valid Business Reason for such
postponement, suspension or  withdrawal no longer exists, in each case,
promptly after the occurrence thereof. Each Stockholder of Registrable
Securities agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company that the
Company has determined to suspend use of, withdraw,  terminate or postpone
filing, amending or supplementing any registration statement pursuant to
clause (B) above, such Stockholder will discontinue its disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement. If the
Company  shall have suspended use of, withdrawn or prematurely terminated a
registration statement filed under _Section 5.1(a)_ (whether pursuant to
clause  (B) above or as a result of any stop order, injunction or other order
or requirement of the SEC or any other governmental agency or court), the
Company shall not be considered to have effected a Demand Registration for the
purposes of _Section 5.1(a)_ until the Company shall have permitted use of
such suspended registration statement or filed a new registration statement
covering the  Registrable Securities covered by the withdrawn or terminated
registration statement and such registration statement shall have been
declared effective and shall not have been withdrawn and any stop order or
injunction has been lifted and any  other order or requirement of the SEC or
any other governmental agency or court has been complied with such that the
sale of securities under the registration statement is permissable. If the
Company shall give any notice of suspension,  withdrawal or postponement of a
registration statement, the Company shall, not later than five (5) Business
Days after the Valid Business Reason that caused such suspension, withdrawal
or postponement no longer exists (but in no event later  than sixty-five (65)
days after the date of the suspension, postponement or withdrawal), as
applicable, permit use of such suspended registration statement or use its
commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration under the 
Securities Act of the Registrable Securities covered by the withdrawn or
postponed registration statement in accordance with this _Section 5.1(e)_  
(unless the Stockholders shall have withdrawn such request, in which case the
Company shall not be considered to have effected a Demand Registration for the
purposes of _Section 5.1(a)_ and such request shall not count as a Demand
Registration under _Section 5.1(b)_ ), and  following such permission or such
effectiveness such registration shall no longer be deemed to be suspended,
withdrawn or postponed pursuant to clause (B) above.

 

(f) In the event of a Demand Registration, the Company shall be required to
maintain the continuous effectiveness of the applicable  Registration
Statement for a period of at least 180 days after the effective date thereof
or such shorter period in which all Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement have actually been sold, except that if the Company
is  requested to file a shelf registration pursuant to Rule 415 of the
Securities Act for an offering on a delayed or continuous basis it shall be
required to maintain the continuous effectiveness of such Registration
Statement until all  Registrable Securities initially covered thereby are no
longer Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, a registration requested pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ shall not
be deemed to have been effected and shall not be deemed a Demand Registration
under _Section  5.1(b)_ (i) if not a registration statement filed pursuant to
Rule 415 for an offering on a delayed or continuous basis, if it does not
remain effective for at least 180 days (or such shorter period as will
terminate when all  securities covered by such registration statement have
been sold or withdrawn) or (ii) in the event of an underwritten offering, if
the conditions to closing specified in the purchase agreement or underwriting
agreement entered into in  connection with such registration are not
satisfied or waived other than by reason of some wrongful act or omission by a
holder of Registrable Securities affiliated with the Demand Holder that made
the request for the Demand Registration.

 

(g) Within sixty (60) days of becoming eligible  to file a Form S-3 or Form
F-3 or any comparable or successor form or forms or any similar short-form
registration (including pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act) ("
_Short-Form Registration_ "), the Company shall, upon the written request
delivered to the Company of any Stockholder  who was such at the Effective
Time (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not be considered a Demand
Registration), file a shelf registration statement on such form providing for
the registration of, and the sale on a continuous or delayed  basis of all of
the Registrable Securities, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, to
permit the distribution of the Registrable Securities. Upon filing a Short
Form Registration, the Company will use its commercially reasonable  efforts
to keep such Short-Form Registration effective with the SEC at all times
through the end of the Effective Period and to refile such Short-Form 
Registration upon its expiration (if such expiration occurs prior to the end
of the Effective Period), and to cooperate in any shelf take down by amending
or supplementing the prospectus statement related to such Short-Form
Registration as  may reasonably be requested by the holders of Registrable
Securities or as otherwise required. Any holder of Registrable Securities
included in the Short-Form Registration (an " _Initiating Shelf Holder_ ") may
initiate an offering or sale of all or part of such Registrable Securities (a
" _Shelf Take-Down_ "), in which case the provisions of this _Section 5.1(g)_
shall apply. If an Initiating Shelf Holder is a  Stockholder who was such as
of the Effective Date, it may elect, in a written request delivered to the
Company (an " _Underwritten Shelf Take-Down  Notice_ "), that a Shelf Take-
Down be in the form of an underwritten offering (an " _Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down_ ") and the Company shall file and effect an amendment or supplement
to its Short-Form  Registration for such purpose as soon as practicable;
provided, that any such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down that is a Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down (as defined below) shall be deemed to be, for
purposes of _Section 5.1(b)_, a Demand Registration. Such Initiating Shelf 
Holder shall indicate in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice whether it
intends for such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down to involve a customary "road
show" (including an "electronic road show") or other substantial marketing
effort by the  underwriters (a " _Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ ").
Upon receipt of an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice indicating that such
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down will be a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down,
the Company shall promptly (but in any event no later than  ten days prior to
the expected date of such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down) give written
notice of such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down to all other holders of
Registrable Securities and, subject to the priorities described in _Section
5.1(d)_ , shall permit the participation of all such  holders that request
inclusion in such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down who respond in writing
within five days after the receipt of such notice of their election to
participate. If such Initiating Shelf Holder desires to effect a Shelf  Take-
Down that does not constitute a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down (a "
_Non-Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ "), the Initiating Shelf Holder
shall so indicate in the Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice delivered to the
Company, which request shall include (i) the total  number of Registrable
Securities expected to be offered and sold in such Non-Marketed Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down, (ii) the expected plan of distribution of such Non-Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down and (iii) the action or actions  required
(including the timing thereof) in connection with such Non-Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down (including the delivery of one or more stock
certificates representing shares of Registrable Securities to be sold in such
Non-Marketed  Underwritten Shelf Take-Down), and, the Company shall file and
effect an amendment or supplement to its Form S-3 Shelf Registration Statement
for such purpose as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary,  Initiating Shelf Holder(s) shall only be entitled to request a
Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down pursuant to this _Section 5.1(g)_ if
such Initiating Shelf Holder(s), together with all other Initiating Shelf
Holders delivering the request for the Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down,
are  requesting the registration of Registrable Securities with an aggregate
estimated market value of at least $25 million.

 

(h) In connection with the Transfer of Registrable Securities to any Person in
accordance herewith, a Stockholder who was such as of  the Effective Time may
(i) assign the right to exercise one Demand Registration pursuant to _Section
5.1(a)_ with respect to a transfer of Company  Securities representing at
least 50% of the Registrable Securities held by such Stockholder as of the
Effective Time and (ii) grant the right to participate in any registration
pursuant to the terms of _Section 5.1(i)_.

 

(i) (A) If, at any time during the Effective Period, the Company (other than
pursuant to _Section 5.1(a)_ through _(h)_ ) proposes or is required to file a
registration statement  under the Securities Act with respect to an offering
of Company Securities, whether or not for sale for its own account (other than
a registration statement (i) on Form S-4, Form S-8 or any successor forms
thereto, (ii) filed solely in  connection with any employee benefit or
dividend reinvestment plan or (iii) pursuant to a Demand Registration in
accordance with _Section 5.1_   hereof), in a manner that would permit
registration of Registrable Securities for sale to the public under the
Securities Act, then the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
give written notice of such proposed filing at least 30  days before the
anticipated filing date (the " _Piggyback Notice_ ") to the holders of
Registrable Securities. The Piggyback Notice shall offer the  holders of
Registrable Securities the opportunity to include in such registration
statement the number of Registrable Securities as they may request (a "
_Piggyback        Registration_ "). Subject to _Section 5.1(i)(B)_
hereof, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to include
in  each such Piggyback Registration all Registrable Securities with respect
to which the Company has received from any holder thereof written requests for
inclusion therein within 15 days following receipt of any Piggyback Notice by
such holder,  which request shall specify the maximum number of Registrable
Securities intended to be disposed of by such holder and the intended method
of distribution thereof. The holders shall be permitted to withdraw all or
part of the Registrable  Securities from a Piggyback Registration at any time
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the effective date of the Registration
Statement relating to such Piggyback Registration. No Piggyback Registration
shall count towards registrations  required under _Section 5.1(b)_.

 

(B) If any of the securities to be registered pursuant to the registration
giving rise  to the rights of holders of Registrable Securities under this
_Section 5.1(i)_ are to be sold in an underwritten offering, such holders
shall be  permitted to include all Registrable Securities requested to be
included in such registration in such offering on the same terms and
conditions as any Other Securities included therein; provided, however, that
if such offering involves a firm  commitment underwritten offering and the
managing underwriter(s) of such underwritten offering advise the Company in
writing that it is their good faith opinion that the total amount of
Registrable Securities requested to be so included,  together with all Other
Securities that the Company and any other Persons having rights to participate
in such registration intend to include in such offering, exceeds the total
number or dollar amount of such securities that can be sold  without having
an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Registrable
Securities to be so included together with all Other Securities, then there
shall be included in such firm commitment underwritten offering the number
or  dollar amount of Registrable Securities and such Other Securities that in
the good faith opinion of such managing underwriter(s) can be sold without so
adversely affecting such offering, and such number of Registrable Securities
and Other  Securities shall be allocated for inclusion as follows:

 

(i) first, all Other Securities being sold by the Company, in the case of a
registration initiated by the Company, or  by any Person (other than a holder
of Registrable Securities), in the case of a registration initiated by such
Person, exercising a contractual right to demand registration;

 

(ii) second, all Registrable Securities requested to be included by the
holders thereof, pro rata (if applicable),  based on the number of
Registrable Securities Beneficially Owned by each such holder; and

 

(iii) third, all Other Securities being sold by the Company (in the case of a
registration in response to the exercise  of contractual right to a demand
registration other than by a holder of Registrable Securities) or, in the case
of a Company initiated registration, being sold by any other holders of Other
Securities requesting to participate therein, pro  rata, based on the number
of Other Securities Beneficially Owned by each such holder of Other Securities
or as otherwise determined by such holders of Other Securities.

 

(j) (A) Each Stockholder agrees that in connection with any registered
underwritten offering of Registrable Securities in which it  is a
participating as a selling Stockholder, and upon request from the managing
underwriter(s) for such offering, such Stockholder will not, without the prior
written consent of such managing underwriter(s), during such period as is
reasonably  requested by the managing underwriter(s) (which period shall in
no event be longer than ninety (90) days from the pricing date of such
offering), Transfer any Registrable Securities held by such Stockholder. The
foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.1(j)(A)_ shall be applicable to the
Stockholders only if, for so long as and to the extent that the Company, the
directors and executive  officers of the Company and each selling Stockholder
included in such offering are subject to substantially similar restrictions.
Each Stockholder agrees to execute and deliver such other agreements as may be
reasonably requested by the  managing underwriter(s) that are consistent with
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.1(j)(A)_ and are necessary to give
further effect  thereto and each such Stockholder shall receive the benefit
of any shorter "lockup" period or permitted exceptions (on a pro rata basis)
or waivers agreed to by the managing underwriter(s) for any such offering.

 

(B) For the avoidance of doubt. with respect to each underwritten offering of
Registrable Securities covered by a registration pursuant to _Section 5.1_ ,
the Company agrees that upon request from the managing underwriter(s) for such
offering, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of such
managing underwriter(s), during  such period as is reasonably requested by
the managing underwriter(s) (which period shall in no event be longer than
ninety (90) days from the pricing date of such offering), effect any public
sale or distribution, or to file any registration  statement (other than (x)
any such registration statement required under _Section 3.1_ or (y) a
registration statement (i) on Form S-4, Form S-8  or any successor forms
thereto or (ii) filed solely in connection with any employee benefit or
dividend reinvestment plan) covering any of its equity securities, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such 
securities. The foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.1(j)(B)_ shall be
applicable to the Company only if, for so long as and to the extent that  the
each selling Stockholder included in such offering are subject to
substantially similar restrictions. The Company agrees to execute and deliver
such other agreements as may be reasonably requested by the managing
underwriter(s) that are  consistent with the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.1(j)(B)_ and are necessary to give further effect thereto and shall
receive the  benefit of any shorter "lockup" period or permitted exceptions
or waivers agreed to by the managing underwriter(s) for any such offering.

 

Section 5.2 _Registration Procedures_.

 

(a) If and whenever a Stockholder properly requests that the Company effect

(d)In the case of any registration under this _Article V_ involving an

(e) The Company shall pay directly all costs, fees and expenses (other than

Except as  provided above, each Stockholder shall pay the fees and expenses
of any counsel engaged by such Stockholder and shall bear its respective
Selling Expenses associated with a registered sale of its Registrable
Securities pursuant to this _Article V_. The obligation of the Company to bear
and pay its Registration Expenses shall apply irrespective of whether a
registration, once properly  demanded or requested, becomes effective or is
withdrawn or suspended.

 

(f) If any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Demand
Registration or shelf registration is an underwritten offering,  the holders
holding a majority of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering
shall select the investment bank or investment banks and managers marketing
the offering with the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Company shall have the
right to select the investment bank or investment banks and managers to market

holding a  majority of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such
offering, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 

Section 5.3 _Indemnification; Contribution._

 

(a) In the event of any registration or offer and sale of any securities of
the Company under the Securities Act pursuant to this _Article V_ , the
Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold
harmless each Stockholder of Registrable Securities included  in a
registration statement, any Person who is or might be deemed to be a
"controlling person" (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act
and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) (each such Person, a " _Controlling
Person_ ") of such Stockholder, their respective direct and indirect general
and limited partners, directors, officers, managers, members, employees,
agents,  Affiliates and shareholders, and each other Person, if any, who acts
on behalf of or controls any such Stockholder or Controlling Person and any

such underwriter (each of the foregoing, a " _Covered Person_ ") against any
losses,  claims, actions, damages, liabilities, expenses (including, without
limitation, costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees and any other
reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any
legal, administrative,  regulatory or other suit, action, claim, audit,

judgments, fines, penalties, charges and amounts paid in settlement, joint or
several, to which such Covered Person may be,  or is threatened to become,
subject or be involved under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state
blue sky securities laws, any equivalent non-U.S. securities laws or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, actions, damages,  liabilities or
expenses arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in or incorporated by reference in any
Registration Statement, Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus, free writing 
prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act or any successor
rule thereto) or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any document
incorporated by reference therein, (ii) any omission or alleged omission of a
material  fact required to be stated in any Registration Statement or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, (iii) any omission or alleged omission of a material
fact required to be stated  in any Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus, free
writing prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
document incorporated by reference therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances  under which they were made, not
misleading, (iv) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the
Securities Act or any other similar federal or state securities laws or any
rule or regulation promulgated thereunder or any equivalent  non-U.S.

registration of securities or (v) any information provided by the Company or
at the  instruction of the Company to any Person participating in the offer
at the point of sale containing any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact or omitting or allegedly omitting any material
fact required to be  included in such information or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and the Company shall promptly reimburse
each Covered Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
such Covered Person in connection with  investigating or defending any such
loss, claim, action, damage or liability as such expenses are incurred;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not  be so liable in any such case to the
extent that any loss, claim, action, damage, liability or expense arises out
of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or
omission or alleged omission, made or incorporated  by reference in any such
Registration Statement, Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus, free writing
prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act or any successor
rule thereto) or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any  document
incorporated by reference therein or other information in reliance upon, and
in conformity with, written information prepared and furnished to the Company
by such Covered Person expressly for use therein. This indemnity shall be in 
addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have.

 

(b) In connection with any registration in which a Stockholder of Registrable
Securities is participating, each such Stockholder  shall furnish to the
Company in writing such information as the Company reasonably requests for use
in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus and shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless  the
Company, its directors and officers, employees, agents and any Person who is
or might be deemed to be a Controlling Person of the Company against any
losses, claims, actions, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without
limitation,  costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees and any
other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with
any legal, administrative, regulatory or other suit, action, claim, audit,
assessment, arbitration or other  proceeding, investigation or inquiry),
judgments, fines, penalties, charges and amounts paid in settlement,, joint or
several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any state blue sky  securities laws, any equivalent
non-U.S. securities laws or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
actions, damages, liabilities or expenses arising out of or based upon (i) any
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact  contained in the
Registration Statement, Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus, free writing
prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act or any successor
rule thereto) or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, (ii) any 
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated in any
Registration Statement or any supplement thereto or amendment thereof or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (iii) any omission or
alleged  omission of a material fact required to be stated in any Prospectus,
preliminary Prospectus, free writing prospectus or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances  under which they were made, not misleading or (iv) any
information provided by such Stockholder or at the instruction of such
Stockholder to any Person participating in the offer at the point of sale
containing any untrue statement or alleged  untrue statement of any material
fact or omitting or allegedly omitting any material fact required to be
included in such information or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, but, in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii),  (iii) and (iv),
only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or
omission or alleged omission, is made in such Registration Statement,
Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus, free writing prospectus (as defined in
Rule  405 under the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto), any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto or other information in reliance upon,
and in conformity with, written information prepared and furnished to the
Company by such  Stockholder expressly for use therein, and such Stockholder
shall promptly reimburse the Company, its directors and officers, employees,
agents and any Person who is or might be deemed to be a Controlling Person of
the Company for any legal or  other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, action,
damage, liability or expense as such expenses are incurred; _provided_ , that
the obligation to indemnify pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ shall not exceed an
amount  equal to the net proceeds (after deducting Selling Expenses) actually
received by such Stockholder in the sale of Registrable Securities to which
such Registration Statement or Prospectus relates. This indemnity shall be in
addition to any  liability which such Stockholder may otherwise have.

 

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall give prompt written
notice to the indemnifying party of any action or  proceeding with respect to
which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ ;
_provided_ , that any failure or delay to so notify the indemnifying party
shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder, except
to the extent that the  indemnifying party is actually and materially
prejudiced by reason of such failure or delay. In case a claim or an action
that is subject or potentially subject to indemnification hereunder is brought
against an indemnified party, the  indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate in and shall have the right, exercisable by giving written notice
to the indemnified party as promptly as practicable after receipt of written
notice from such indemnified party of such claim  or action, to assume, at
the indemnifying party's expense, the defense of any such claim or action,
with counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party; _provided_ , that
any indemnified party shall continue to be entitled to participate in the
defense of such claim or action, with counsel of its own choice, but the
indemnifying party shall not be  obligated to reimburse the indemnified party
for any fees, costs and expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified
party in connection with such defense unless (A) the indemnifying party has
agreed in writing to pay such fees, costs and  expenses, (B) the indemnifying
party has failed to assume the defense of such claim or action within a
reasonable time after receipt of notice of such claim or action, (C) having
assumed the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying  party fails to
employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party or to pursue the
defense of such claim or action in a reasonably vigorous manner, (D) the use
of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified 
party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest or (E) the
indemnified party has reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal
or equitable defenses available to it and/or any other indemnified party which
are different  from or additional to those available to the indemnifying
party. Subject to the proviso in the foregoing sentence, no indemnifying party
shall, in connection with any one (1) claim or action or separate but
substantially similar or related  actions in the same jurisdiction arising
out of the same general circumstances or allegations, be liable for the fees,
costs and expenses of more than one (1) firm of attorneys (in addition to any
local counsel) for all indemnified parties. The  indemnifying party shall not
have the right to settle a claim or action for which any indemnified party is
entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent of the indemnified
party, and the indemnifying party shall not consent to the  entry of any
judgment or enter into or agree to any settlement relating to such claim or
action unless such judgment or settlement does not impose any admission of
wrongdoing or ongoing obligations on any indemnified party and includes as
an  unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff
therein to such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party, of a full and final release from all
liability in respect of such  claim or action. The indemnifying party shall
not be liable hereunder for any amount paid or payable or incurred pursuant to
or in connection with any judgment entered or settlement effected with the
consent of an indemnified party unless the  indemnifying party has also
consented to such judgment or settlement (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.3_ is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to, or unenforceable by, an
indemnified party in respect of any loss, claim, action, damage, liability or
expense referred to  herein, then the applicable indemnifying party, in lieu
of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss,
claim, action, damage, liability or  expense in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the
one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with
the statements, omissions or violations which resulted in  such loss, claim,
action, damage, liability or expense as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand,
and of the indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined  by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by
the indemnified  party, whether the violation of the Securities Act or any
other federal or state securities law or rule or regulation promulgated
thereunder or equivalent non-U.S. securities laws applicable to the Company
and relating to any action or inaction  required of the Company in connection
with any registration of securities was perpetrated by the indemnifying party
or the indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or  prevent such statement,
omission or violation. The parties agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant hereto were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method or allocation that does not take into
account  the equitable considerations referred to in this _Section 5.3(iv)_.
In no event shall the amount which a Stockholder of Registrable Securities
may  be obligated to contribute pursuant to this _Section 5.3(iv)_ exceed an
amount equal to the net proceeds (after deducting Selling Expenses)  actually
received by such Stockholder in the sale of Registrable Securities that gives
rise to such obligation to contribute. No indemnified party guilty or liable
of fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 
Securities Act shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.3_   shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified
party or any officer, director or Controlling Person of such indemnified party
and shall survive the Transfer of any Registrable  Securities by any
Stockholder.

 

Section 5.4 _Rule 144_. The Company covenants that it will timely file the 
reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (or, if the
Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any
holder of  Registrable Securities, use commercially reasonable efforts to
make publicly available other information which would permit sales pursuant to
Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any similar rules or regulations
hereafter adopted by the SEC),  and it will use commercially reasonable
efforts to take such further action as any such holder may reasonably request
to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration
under the Securities Act within the limitation of  the exemptions provided by
(i) Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from time
to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.

avoidance doubt, no Company Securities Beneficially Owned by a Related Person
shall have any registration rights under  _Article V_ ; and (ii) in
connection with each and any Related Person Purchase, such Related Person
shall agree by a written instrument to be  executed and delivered to the
Company that any and all Company Securities purchased pursuant to a Related
Person Purchase shall be voted in proportion to all other stockholders of the
Company other than the applicable Stockholder, unless  specifically invited
in writing by the Company to do so. Any breach by a Related Person of this

Section 7.10 _Injunctive Relief_. Each party  hereto acknowledges that it
would be impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from
any breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement and that the remedy at
law for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such  provisions would
likely be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that the other party shall, in
addition to any other rights or remedies which it may have, be entitled to
such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from any court of 
competent jurisdiction to compel specific performance of, or restrain any
party from violating, any of such provisions. In connection with any action or
proceeding for injunctive relief, each party hereto hereby waives the claim or
defense that  a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, to have each provision of this Agreement specifically
enforced against it, without the necessity of posting bond or other security
against it, and consents to  the entry of injunctive relief against it
enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of such provisions of
this Agreement.
