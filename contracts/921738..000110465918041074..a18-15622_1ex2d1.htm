 **ARTICLE 1.** ** 
_THE MERGER_**

 



 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, (a) Merger Sub will merge with and into HoldCo, (b) the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and (c) HoldCo will continue its
corporate existence under the DGCL with respect to the Merger as

 



      
 

 



 

the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ").

 



 

Section 1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, HoldCo, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by HoldCo and
Parent in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance
with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

Section 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the
Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
franchises, licenses and authority of HoldCo and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions
and duties of each of HoldCo and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws_. At the Effective Time,
(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof or as
provided by Applicable Law, and (b) the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or as provided by
Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case, that the name of
the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of HoldCo.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of Merger
Sub, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Effect of the Merger on Shares_. At the Effective Time, as a
result of the Merger and without the necessity of any further action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, any of the Companies, or any Stockholder:

 



 

(a) Any Shares that are owned by any Buyer Party or HoldCo (as treasury stock
or otherwise), or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries, shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be cancelled and retired in
accordance with _Section 1.6(a)_, and (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Closing Per Share Common Stock Amount,
in cash, without interest, together with any amounts that may become payable
in respect of such Share in the future from the Escrow Accounts as provided in
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or in respect of any post-closing
adjustment(s) contemplated by _Section 1.17_ (the " _Post-Closing
Adjustments_ " and each a " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ "), at the respective
times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and therein.

 



 

(c) Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding, including the Restricted
Preferred Shares, immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
Shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with _Section 1.6(a)_, and
(ii) Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the
Closing Per Share Preferred Stock Amount applicable thereto in cash, without
interest, and, in the case of Series B Shares (including Restricted Preferred
Shares), together with any amounts that may become payable in respect of such
Series B Share in the future from the Escrow Accounts as provided in this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or in respect of any Post-Closing
Adjustments contemplated by _Section 1.17_, at the respective times and
subject to the contingencies specified herein and therein.

 



 

(d) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Rounding_. The portion of the Closing Common Stock Merger
Consideration or Closing Preferred Stock Merger Consideration that each Common
Stockholder or Preferred Stockholder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 1.6(b)_ or _Section 1.6(c)_, and the portion of the Merger
Consideration deposited into each Escrow Account on the account of each such
Stockholder, shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with $0.005 being rounded
upward).

 



 

Section 1.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, including _Section 1.6_, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares
cancelled in accordance with _Section 1.6(a)_) and held by a holder who has
not voted, as applicable, in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented
thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares being referred
to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under the
DGCL with respect to such Shares) shall not be converted into a right to
receive a portion of the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled
to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such
Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 1.6_, without

 



      
 

 



 

interest thereon. HoldCo shall provide Parent and Operator prompt written
notice of any demands received by HoldCo for appraisal of Shares, any
withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to HoldCo prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that
relates to such demand, and the Buyer Parties shall have the opportunity and
right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.

Section 1.9 _Surrender and Payment_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, all Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled, retired and extinguished, as
applicable, and shall cease to exist, and, subject to _Section 1.8_, each
holder of a certificate or other instrument formerly representing any Shares
(each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights as a Stockholder,
other than to receive the consideration for the Shares hereunder.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the Parties shall
designate TMI Trust Company, a Texas trust company, to act as exchange agent
in the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") pursuant to a commercially reasonable
exchange agent agreement entered into by Parent, Operator and the Exchange
Agent. At or before the Effective Time, Parent and Operator shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
Stockholders, for exchange in accordance with this _Section 1.9_, through the
Exchange Agent, cash in U.S. dollars in the respective amounts set forth in
_Section 1.14_ and sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration as provided
herein (such cash, and all interest and earnings thereon, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") payable pursuant to _Section 1.6_ in
exchange for outstanding Shares. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
paid pursuant to _Section 1.6_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(c) The Exchange Agent shall, no later than five (5) Business Days after the
Closing, subject to receipt of all Certificates, Letters of Transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and any other customary documents that the Exchange Agent may reasonably
require in connection therewith, pay to the respective Stockholders the cash
amounts as provided in _Section 1.6_ with respect to each such Stockholders
surrendered Certificate, and each such Certificate shall forthwith be
cancelled. Unless otherwise provided herein, no interest shall be paid or
shall accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that are not registered in the
transfer records of HoldCo, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a
transferee only if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer including, if able to be provided, a FIRPTA Statement and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed from and
after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to receive
the portion of the Merger Consideration

 



      
 

 



 

as provided in _Section 1.6_. If after the Effective Time, any Certificate is
presented to the Exchange Agent, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Section 1.9_.

 



 

(d) Each Common Stockholder and Series B Stockholder shall also be entitled to
any amounts that may be payable in the future in respect of the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates from the Escrow Accounts as provided
in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and on account of the applicable
Post-Closing Adjustment, if any, at the respective time and subject to the
contingencies specified herein and therein.

 



 

(e) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed, or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and (ii)
the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificates or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration or other amounts that remain
unclaimed by the Stockholders one year after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Buyer Parties in their respective Pro Rata Portions, upon demand,
and any such Stockholder who has not exchanged Certificates for the Merger
Consideration or other amounts in accordance with this _Section 1.9_ prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to Buyer Parties in their respective Pro
Rata Portions for payment of the Merger Consideration or such other amounts;
_provided_ , that any such portion of the Merger Consideration payable from
the Escrow Accounts shall be held and distributed to the Persons entitled
thereto in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, at the respective times and subject to the contingencies specified
herein and therein and any portion of any Post-Closing Adjustment to which the
Stockholders may become entitled shall become payable at the times and subject
to the contingencies specified herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
Parties shall not be liable to any holder of Certificates for any amounts paid
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by Stockholders immediately
prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, the property of Buyer Parties in their respective Pro Rata
Portions free and clear of any Claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Buyer Parties
in their respective Pro Rata Portions, upon demand.

 



 

Section 1.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All Merger Consideration
or other amounts paid or payable upon the surrender of Certificates, in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid or payable
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, and from and after the Effective Time, there

 



      
 

 



 

shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration or other consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.11 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
HoldCo shall occur as may be permitted herein, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of such shares, or any stock
dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable to the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

 



 

Section 1.12 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger
Sub, Operator, Guarantor and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld, taking into account any forms or other certifications that a
Stockholder has timely provided that would reduce, including to zero, amounts
required to be deducted or withheld, with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, Operator,
Guarantor or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, Operator,
Guarantor or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

 



 

Section 1.13 _Lost Certificates or other Instruments_. If any Certificate or
other instrument evidencing the Shares shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and agreeing to indemnify the
Buyer Parties and their Affiliates and Representatives and, if required by the
Buyer Parties, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as the Buyer Parties may direct, as indemnity against any Claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate as contemplated herein.

good faith estimate and a reasonably detailed calculation of (1) the Closing
Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and (2)
the Closing Cash Amount (the " _Estimated Closing Cash Amount_ "). From and
after the delivery of the Closing Certificate, HoldCo shall provide Operator
and its Representatives with reasonable access to the applicable books and
records and the Persons involved in preparing or reviewing the Closing
Certificate, for purposes of Operators review and verification. At HoldCos
request, during the period after delivery of the Closing Certificate and prior
to the Closing, HoldCo and Operator shall reasonably cooperate with each other
to update the calculations in the Closing Certificate to the extent HoldCo
believes in good faith that such updates would make the estimated calculations
more accurate.

 



 

(i) If the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital set forth on the Closing
Certificate is (A) _less than_ the Target Net Working Capital, the Operator
Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be reduced by an amount equal to
such difference, or (B) _greater than_ the Target Net Working Capital, the
Operator Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be increased by an amount
equal to such difference.

 



 

(ii) If the Estimated Closing Cash Amount set forth on the Closing Certificate
is (A) _less than_ the Target Cash Amount, the Operator Purchase Price
payable at the Closing shall be reduced by an amount equal to such difference,
or (B) _greater than_ the Target Cash Amount, the Operator Purchase Price
payable at the Closing shall be increased by an amount equal to such

procedures and methodologies mutually agreed by the Parties and otherwise as
set forth in this _Section 1.17(b)_. Operator shall be entitled to have
Representatives present during the Cash Count, which Representatives shall
have full access to the Cash Count proceedings and cooperate in good faith to
resolve any disputes regarding the conduct of the Cash Count. The results of
the Cash Count shall, absent manifest error, be binding on the Parties and be
used in determining the Closing Cash Amount and the preparation of the Post-
Closing Certificate.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, but in no event
more than 60 calendar days after the Closing, Operator shall prepare and
deliver to Stockholder Representative a certificate (the " _Post-Closing
Certificate_ ") of the Chief Financial Officer (or other executive vested with
similar duties) of Operator setting forth Operators reasonably detailed
calculation of (i) the Closing Net Working Capital and (ii) the Closing Cash
Amount (the items referenced in this _Section 1.17(c)(i)_  _(ii)_ ,
collectively, the " _Closing Components_ " and each a " _Closing Component_
").

 



 

(d) For a period of 45 calendar days following delivery of the Post-Closing
Certificate and supporting documentation, Operator shall provide Stockholder
Representative with reasonable access to the books and records and the Persons
involved in preparing or reviewing the Post-Closing Certificate, for purposes
of review and verification.

 



 

(e) Within the 45 calendar day period specified in _Section 1.17(d)_,
Stockholder Representative shall notify Operator in writing of its acceptance
of each Closing Component set forth on the Post-Closing Certificate or its
disagreement with respect to any one or more thereof, specifying in reasonable
detail all disputed items and the basis therefor. If Stockholder
Representative provides a notice of acceptance or does not provide a notice of
disagreement within such 45 calendar day period, then Stockholder
Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the respective Closing
Components set forth in the Post-Closing Certificate delivered by Operator,
which shall then be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder.
If Stockholder Representative provides Operator with a notice of disagreement
within such 45 calendar day period, then Operator and Stockholder
Representative shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to timely
resolve any such disagreement. In the event that Operator and Stockholder
Representative resolve any such disagreement within 30 calendar days after
Operators receipt of such notice of disagreement by Stockholder
Representative, then the applicable Closing Components set forth on the Post-
Closing Certificate shall be modified accordingly. In the event that Operator
and Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve any such disagreement
during such 30 calendar day period, then Operator and Stockholder
Representative shall engage a mutually agreed upon independent accounting firm
(the " _Dispute Advisor_ ") to review the Post-Closing Certificate and the
work papers used in connection with the preparation of the Post-Closing
Certificate and to determine those items in dispute within an additional 30
calendar days. The decision of the Dispute Advisor as to any modifications to
those Closing Components in dispute, if any, set forth on the Post-Closing
Certificate shall be based solely on the submission of the relevant work
papers created by and/or exchanged between Operator and Stockholder
Representative, as well as the submission of a final position paper by each
Party (each a " _Position Paper_ "), shall not include determinations higher
than the highest submission or lower than the lowest submission for a
particular item in dispute and shall not include any expert involvement (other
than the Dispute Advisor) or in-person proceedings. All modifications made to
the Post-Closing Certificate and (as applicable) any Closing Component by the
Dispute Advisor shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties.
Judgment upon the decision of the Dispute Advisor may be entered upon the
request of Operator or Stockholder Representative in any court of competent
jurisdiction. In the event the Dispute Advisor (i) does not concur

 



      
 

 



 

with the position of Stockholder Representative reflected in its Position
Paper, the fees and expenses of the Dispute Advisor shall be paid by
Stockholder Representative, (ii) does not concur with the position of Operator
reflected in its Position Paper, the fees and expenses of the Dispute Advisor
shall be paid by Operator, and (iii) partially concurs with the position of
each of Stockholder Representative and Operator reflected in their Position
Papers, the fees and expenses of the Dispute Advisor shall be divided in equal
proportion between Operator and Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(f) If the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.17(e)_, is (i) _less_ than the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital, then (A) Stockholder Representative and Operator shall instruct the
Escrow Agent, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to pay to
Operator the amount equal to such difference from the Post-Closing Adjustment
Escrow Account, and (B) if such difference exceeds the amounts remaining in
the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Account, from the Indemnification Escrow
Account as a dollar-for-dollar reduction to the Indemnification Escrow Account
in cash within five (5) Business Days after such final determination of
Closing Net Working Capital, or (ii) _greater than_ the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital, then Operator shall pay the amount equal to such difference
to the Exchange Agent, in cash, within five (5) Business Days after such final
determination of Closing Net Working Capital, which amount shall be deposited
in the Exchange Fund and shall be distributed to the Common Stockholders and
the Series B Stockholders in accordance with their respective Applicable
Percentages.

 



 

(g) If the Closing Cash Amount, as finally determined pursuant to _Section
1.17(e)_, is (i) _less_ _than_ the Estimated Closing Cash Amount, then (A)
Stockholder Representative and Operator shall instruct the Escrow Agent, in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to pay to Operator the
amount equal to such difference, from the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow
Account, and (B) if such difference exceeds the amounts remaining in the Post-
Closing Adjustment Escrow Account, from the Indemnification Escrow Account as
a dollar-for-dollar reduction to the Indemnification Escrow Account in cash
within five (5) Business Days after such final determination of Closing Cash
Amount, or (ii) _greater than_ the Estimated Closing Cash Amount, then
Operator shall pay the amount equal to such difference to the Exchange Agent,
in cash, within five (5) Business Days after such final determination of
Closing Cash Amount, which amount shall be deposited in the Exchange Fund and
shall be distributed to the Common Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders
in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.

 



 

(h) Any amounts payable to Operator and any amounts payable to the Exchange
Agent pursuant _Section 1.17(f)_ and _Section 1.17(g)_ shall be offset
against each other (i.e., only the net amount shall be paid to the applicable
party and such amount shall be used for determining the amounts remaining in
the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Account and any amount deducted from the
Indemnification Escrow Account). If, following the payment of the adjustments
set forth in _Section 1.17(f)_ and _Section 1.17(g)_, there are any funds
remaining in the Post-Closing Adjustment Account, within five (5) Business
Days after final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital and Closing
Cash Amount, Stockholder Representative and Operator shall instruct the Escrow
Agent,

 



      
 

 



 

in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to pay the balance of
the Post-Closing Adjustment Account to the Exchange Agent, which amount shall
be deposited in the Exchange Fund and shall be distributed to the Common
Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders in accordance with their respective
Applicable Percentages.

property leased by any Company as well as a complete list of all leases,
subleases and licenses granting leasehold or subleasehold estates and other

Real Property_ " and together with the Owned Real Property, the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Real Property_ "). HoldCo has made available to Parent true, complete and
correct copies of all leases, subleases and licenses for the Leased Real
Property, together with all lease guaranties, subordination, non-disturbance
and attornment agreements and all amendments, modifications or supplements, if
any, thereto, to which any of the Companies is a party (collectively, the "
_Leases_ "), all of which are listed on _Schedule 2.7(b)_. For the avoidance
of doubt, the term "Lease" includes the Ground Lease. The Companies are in
compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Leases.

owned or leased by the Companies (i) are in good operating condition and, to
the Knowledge of HoldCo, without structural defects, subject to normal wear

HoldCo, are free from latent and patent defects and (iii) to the Knowledge of
HoldCo, comply in all material respects with Applicable Laws.

 



 

(d) No Leased Real Property is subject to any sublease, right of first
refusal, option to purchase or right of occupancy. The leases of the Leased
Real Property contain no prohibition on assignment or transfer, "change of
control" or other similar provision, in each case, requiring approval or
consent of any respective landlord thereunder in order to consummate the
Merger. None of the Companies has received any written notice from the lessor
or any sublessor under any lease of Leased Real Property that such party
intends to cancel or terminate any such lease or to exercise or not exercise
any option thereunder.

 



 

(e) Each Company that is party to a Lease is in lawful possession of the
Leased Real Property, subject only to Permitted Encumbrances. The Leases are
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. None of the
Companies, nor, to the Knowledge of HoldCo, any other Person that is a party
to any lease or sublease constituting the Leased Real Property, is in default
or breach (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) in any
material respect under the terms of any such lease or sublease. The
transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not require the consent or
approval of any party to a Lease, nor will such transactions violate any Lease
or cause a Company to be in default under any Lease.

 



 

(f) None of the Companies has received any written notice, and HoldCo has no
knowledge of, any appropriation, condemnation or like Legal Proceeding, or any
violation of any applicable zoning or other Law relating to or affecting the
Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property, and no material Legal
Proceeding has been threatened in writing or commenced relating to or
affecting the Owned Real Property or, to the Companies knowledge, the Leased
Real Property.

 



 

(g) As of the date of this Agreement, the Companies have not received any
written notice of any default under any covenant, easement or restriction
affecting or encumbering any Real Property or any portion thereof that remains
outstanding and uncured.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) The option to purchase the Leased Premises (as such term is defined in the
Ground Lease) as set forth in Section 40 of the Ground Lease has not been
exercised, waived, or voluntarily forfeited by any of the Companies (except to
the extent such action is taken at the request of, or with the approval of,
the Buyer Parties).

 



 

(i) The Companies have not received any written notice from any insurer of any
Real Property requiring any work to be performed as a condition to the renewal
of any Insurance Policy which has not heretofore been complied with or which
is not being performed.

 



 

(j) Neither OpCo nor any of its Affiliates has ever delivered a writing in
recordable form which specifically annexes the Real Property or any part
thereof to the jurisdiction of the Declaration (as more particularly set forth
in Section 10.20 of the Declaration) and, to the knowledge of OpCo, no portion
of the Real Property is subject to the Declaration.

 



 

(k) OpCo has never been assessed for any amounts under the Declaration, has
never received notice of any such assessment; and to the Knowledge of HoldCo,
no such assessment is threatened in writing.

 



 

(l) The exercise by the Servitude Beneficiaries of any rights with respect to
the Sewer Servitude would not, and would not reasonably be expected to,
adversely affect the value of the Owned Real Property in any material respect
or interfere with the operation of the Casino as it is currently operated.

Act, in each case, that have not been disclosed on the Financial Statements.

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or
relating to enforcement of creditors rights generally, and (B) general

Section 3.2 _No Conflicts; Consents_. The execution, delivery and performance
by each Buyer Party of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which
they are parties, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, do not and will not: (w) conflict with or result in a violation
or breach of, or default under, any provision of the certificate of
incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents of any such Buyer
Party, (x) conflict with in any material respect or result in a material
violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law or Order applicable

to which any Buyer Party is a party, or (ii) any material Permit held by any
Buyer Party, or (z) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
Buyer Party or their respective assets, except, in the case of clauses (x),
(y) and (z), for any such conflict, breach, default, acceleration,
termination, modification, cancellation or Lien that would not, individually
or in the

 



       
 

 



 

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on any
such Buyer Partys ability to consummate the Merger and/or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, as applicable.

 



 

(a) With respect to Guarantor and Operator, except (1) as set forth on
_Schedule 3.2(a)_ , and (2) with respect to the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, no consent,
approval, Permit, Order, declaration or filing with, or notice to any

in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents by either Guarantor or Operator and the

in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents by Parent or Merger Sub and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by Parent or Merger Sub, it
being agreed that (A) it is not contemplated hereby or thereby that Parent or
Merger Sub shall be required to seek any consent, approval, Permit, Order,
declaration or filing with, or notice to any Governmental Authority to own the
Business or Operating Assets and (B) it is only contemplated hereby and
thereby that if the Gaming Board imposes any requirement described in clause
(ii)(y) of _Schedule 5.1(b)(i)_ and, as a result of such requirement, Parent
or Merger Sub fail to obtain any Closing Gaming Approvals, such failure shall
not result in, or be deemed a breach of, this _Section 3.2_ or give rise to a
breach of any covenant of Parent contained in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Sufficiency of Funds_.

 



 

(a) Parent has and will have at Closing sufficient cash on hand or other
sources of immediately available funds to enable it to make payment of the
Parent Purchase Price and all other amounts to be paid by Parent hereunder and
to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents.

 



 

(b) Operator has and will have at Closing sufficient cash on hand or other
sources of immediately available funds to enable it to make payment of the
Operator Purchase Price and all other amounts to be paid by Operator hereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Solvency_. No Buyer Party is entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Companies. Each Buyer Party
is Solvent, and, assuming the accuracy

 



      
 

 



 

of the representations and warranties set forth in _Article 2_, each Buyer
Party will, after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration
and all other amounts required to be paid by Buyer Parties pursuant to
_Article 1_, the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the payment of all related fees and expenses, be Solvent at, and
immediately after, the Effective Time. As used in this _Section 3.4_, the
term " _Solvent_ " means with respect to a particular date, that on such date,
(a) with respect to Parent and Merger Sub, (i) the sum of the assets, at a
fair valuation, of Parent and Merger Sub (on a consolidated basis) and of each
of them (on a stand-alone basis) will exceed their debts, (ii) each of Parent
and Merger Sub (on a consolidated basis) and each of them (on a stand-alone
basis) has not incurred and does not intend to incur, and does not believe
that it will incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts
mature, and (iii) each of Parent and Merger Sub (on a consolidated basis) and
each of them (on a stand-alone basis) has sufficient capital and liquidity
with which to conduct its business, and (b) with respect to Operator, (i) the
sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of Operator will exceed its debts,
(ii) Operator has not incurred and does not intend to incur, and does not
believe that it will incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such
debts mature, and (iii) Operator has sufficient capital and liquidity with
which to conduct its business. For purposes of this _Section 3.4_, " _debt_ "
means any liability on a claim, and "claim" means any (1) right to payment,
whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured, and (2) any right to an equitable remedy for breach of
performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right
to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Investment Intent_. Except as contemplated by the Restructuring
Transactions, Parent is acquiring the Shares for investment for its own
account (and that of its Affiliates) and not with a view to any distribution
of such shares within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act.
Except as contemplated by the Restructuring Transactions, Parent is entering
into this Agreement and will consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby to acquire all of the Shares for itself (and that of its
Affiliates) and not as agents or representatives for un-Affiliated any third
parties.

 



 

Section 3.6 _No Prior Activities_. Merger Sub has not incurred nor will it
incur any Liabilities, except those incurred in connection with its
organization and with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and the performance of its obligations hereunder
and thereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. Except as contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, Merger Sub had not engaged in any business activities
of any type or kind whatsoever, or entered into any agreements or arrangements
with any Person, or become subject to or bound by any obligation or
undertaking. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is
directly or indirectly owned beneficially and of record by Parent, free and
clear of all Liens (other than transfer restrictions under applicable federal
and state securities or "blue sky" Laws).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.7 _Gaming Approval Matters_.

 



 

(a) None of Parent, Operator or their respective officers and directors has
ever been denied, or had terminated, suspended or revoked or voluntarily or
otherwise withdrawn an application for, a gaming license or a finding of
suitability by any Governmental Authority or had any disciplinary action taken
against any of their respective gaming licenses or findings of suitability in
any jurisdictions, foreign or domestic. Each of Parent and Operator and each
of their respective officers and directors are in good standing with the
Gaming Authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which Parent, Operator or
any of their respective Affiliates owns or operates gaming facilities.

 



 

(b) None of Parent, Operator or their respective officers and directors has
ever been convicted in a criminal proceeding or has been named the subject of
a pending criminal proceeding that constituted a felony under the Laws of any
jurisdiction or a crime of violence under Louisiana Revised Statute
27:28(B)(1)(e) or would be a felony if committed in the State of Louisiana or
constituted a misdemeanor involving a gaming-related offense, crime of moral
turpitude, drug-related offense, crime of violence or theft by deception
offense (including embezzlement and other thefts using fraud, trickery, scams,
con game or illegal schemes), or involving fraud or misrepresentation
(including bad checks, fraud, forgery, perjury, tax or welfare fraud and
crimes involving false documentation).

 



 

(c) Parent does not have any reason to believe that all Closing Gaming
Approvals necessary for Merger Sub to consummate the Transaction will not be
obtained by Merger Sub in the ordinary course; _provided_ , _however_ , for
the avoidance of doubt, (A) Parent is not seeking or requesting and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is obligated to seek,
request or obtain, any Closing Gaming Approvals necessary for Parent or Merger
Sub to acquire the Business or the Operating Assets and (B) it is only
contemplated hereby that if the Gaming Board imposes any requirement described
in clause (ii)(y) of _Schedule 5.1(b)(i)_ hereof and, as a result of such
requirement, Parent or Merger Sub fail to obtain any Closing Gaming Approvals,
such failure shall not result in, or be deemed a breach of this _Section 3.7_
or give rise to a breach of any covenant of Parent contained in this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) Operator does not have any reason to believe that all Closing Gaming
Approvals necessary for Operator to consummate the Intermediate Sale and any
other transaction to which Operator is party that is contemplated in any
Transaction Document will not be obtained by Operator in the ordinary course.

operations and finances of the Companies with the Companies, and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives and have had an opportunity to
inspect the Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not in

it is aware of that would cause any of such notifying Partys representations
or warranties contained in this Agreement not to be true, correct and
complete, in each case, if such failure to disclose or failure to be true,
correct or complete would cause the conditions set forth in _Section 5.2_ or
_Section 5.3_ not to be satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date, (b) in the
case that HoldCo is the notifying party, (i) any fact, event, circumstance or
action that it is aware of that has had or could, individually or in the

real estate investment trust under the Code, and (y) neither Parent nor
Operator shall have any obligation to take any action or refrain from taking
any action as required by this _Section 4.8_ to the extent that, in the

party consents and estoppel certificates as Parent and Operator may in their
reasonable discretion deem necessary or desirable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.
Parent and Operator shall cooperate with and assist HoldCo in giving such
notices and obtaining such consents and estoppel certificates. At the request
of any Party, each other Party shall execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably
necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent nor Operator shall have any obligation to give any guarantee or other
consideration of any nature in connection with any such notice, consent or
estoppel certificate or consent to any change in the terms of any agreement or
arrangement that Parent and Operator in their sole discretion may deem
materially adverse to the interests of any Company. Notwithstanding anything
to the contract contained herein, the Companies shall not be required to
expend any money to obtain any consent under any Contract, other than de
minimis amounts or amounts for which Buyer Parties have agreed to reimburse
the Companies.

and promptly to consult with the Louisiana Gaming Control Board and shall file
such additional entity applications for approvals and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates to file such other
entity applications for findings of suitability and other approvals as
required by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board in order to pursue the Closing
Gaming Approvals. Operator shall keep HoldCo reasonably apprised regarding all
applications for the Closing Gaming Approvals. Operator shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to schedule and attend any hearings or
meetings with the Louisiana Gaming Control Board to obtain the Closing Gaming
Approvals as promptly as practicable.

(including antitrust Laws and any Gaming Laws), Buyer Parties, HoldCo and
their respective Affiliates shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
(i) any written communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that causes such Party to reasonably believe that there is a
reasonable likelihood that such consent or approval from such Governmental
Authority will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will
be materially delayed; (ii) any written or verbal communication from the
Gaming Control Board that (x) contradicts the current understanding of the
Parties that Parent shall _not_ be required to comply with any licensing or
permitting requirements or regulations normally applicable to operators; and
(y) instead suggests or affirms that Parent, by its technical ownership of the
applicable licenses and permits that will be subsequently and immediately
transferred to Operator, is required to obtain such licenses and permits
normally applicable only to operators; or (iii) any written communication from
any Governmental Authority or any other Person (x) challenging or seeking
damages in connection with the Closing or any other transaction governed by

the Gaming Board on May 14, 2018 (Certificate No. LGCB-4676-18) by June 30,
2019, at such time or times in advance of June 30, 2019 as are consistent with

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after such interim financial statements

the unaudited interim financial statements of HoldCo for each month completed
during the Pre-Closing Period that are prepared in the Ordinary Course of
Business, and (ii) operating or management reports (such reports to be in the
form prepared in the Ordinary Course of Business) of the Business for such

any Buyer Partys reporting obligations on Form 8-K of the SEC (or any
amendments thereto) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
in connection with a public registered debt or equity securities offering by
such Buyer Party prior to Closing, including audited, interim and pro forma
statements as may be required in accordance with Regulation S-X; and (ii) use
its best efforts to cause such auditors to consent to the inclusion of such
financial statements in any Buyer Partys filings on Form 8-K (or any
amendments thereto) or in connection with any such offering, including by
providing such auditors with a reasonable and customary representation letter
in connection therewith; _provided_ , that such an audit shall not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Companies. HoldCo shall
facilitate any such audit at the reasonable request of any Buyer Party,
including by providing such independent accounting firm with reasonable access
to the books, records and employees of the Companies reasonably required to
conduct such audit and reasonable assistance in completing such audit. Buyer
Parties will promptly reimburse HoldCo for any expenses incurred in connection
with its performance under this clause (b).

 



 

(c) Upon the request of any Buyer Party, HoldCo shall provide to such Buyer
Party interim financial statements and other financial information of the
Companies to the extent required for such Buyer Party to comply with SEC
reporting obligations in connection with a public registered offering of debt
or equity securities by such Buyer Party prior to Closing, but only to the
extent such financial statements or financial information are reasonably
requested by such Buyer Party in a timely manner and are otherwise prepared in
the Ordinary Course of Business.

 



 

(d) It is understood and agreed that (i) completing the financial statements
and conducting an audit described in clause (b) above is not a condition to
the parties obligations to complete the Closing and the Closing shall not be
delayed pending the commencement or completion of such an audit, (ii) the
provision of such financial information or the completion of the Companies
financial statements in clause (c) above is not a condition to the parties
obligations to complete the Closing and the Closing shall not be delayed
pending delivery of the Companies financial statements or such financial
information and (iii) the provision of the financial information, the
financial statements and/or the findings of the audit referred to in clauses
(b) and (c) above shall not be permitted to be used as evidence of a breach of
the representations and warranties set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in _Section 2.8_ or form the basis of a claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Article VII_.

 



 

Section 4.10 _Confidentiality_. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
HoldCo, on the one hand, or Parent and Operator, on the other hand, each such
Party, on behalf of itself and its Representatives, agrees (a) except as
required by Law, to keep confidential and not to disclose or reveal any
Confidential Information of the other Party to any Person (other than to the
disclosing Partys Representatives), and (b) not to use Confidential
Information of the other Party for any purpose other than in connection with
its performance of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the
Transaction. In the event that either such Party or its Representatives are
requested pursuant to, or required by, Law or legal process to disclose any
Confidential Information of the other Party such disclosing Party agrees that,
to the extent permitted by Law or legal process, it will provide the other
Party with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable
such other Party, at its expense, to seek an appropriate protective order or
other remedy (and if such other Party seeks such an order, the disclosing
Party will provide such cooperation as such other Party shall reasonably
request) or to consult with such other Party with respect to taking steps to
resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Supplement to Disclosure Schedules_. Prior to Closing, HoldCo
shall supplement or amend _Schedule 2.13(a)_ ( _Business Contracts_ ),
_Schedule 2.9(e)_ ( _Intellectual Property Agreements_ ), _Schedule 2.11(a)_
( _Permits_ ), _Schedule 2.16(a)_ ( _Employees_ ), _Schedule 2.17(a)_ (
_Company Benefit Plans_ ), _Schedule 2.20_ ( _Insurance Policies_ ) and
_Schedule 2.21_ ( _Transactions with Certain Persons_ ) (each, a " _Schedule
Supplement_ "), with respect to any Contract, Permit, Company Benefit Plan or
Insurance Policy required to be disclosed thereon, in each case, that was
first entered into or obtained after the date hereof in compliance with this
Agreement. Any matter disclosed in a Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to
qualify only that representation and warranty to which such matter
specifically pertains; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Schedule Supplement
shall not and shall not be deemed to supplement or amend the applicable
representation or warranty of the Companies as of the date hereof for the
purposes of determining whether any party is entitled to the rights and
remedies set forth in _Article 7_.

 



 

Section 4.12 _Title Policy_. The Companies shall, at no material out of pocket
expense to the Companies, reasonably cooperate with Parents efforts to obtain
a new owners policy of title insurance in the form of _Exhibit J_ covering
each of (i) the Owned Real Property, reflecting the Parents (or its
subsidiarys) fee simple title to the Owned Real Property and (ii) the Leased
Real Property reflecting the Parents (or its subsidiarys) leasehold interest
in the Leased Premises (as defined in the Ground Lease) (including, without
limitation, the lessees interest in the option described in _Section 2.7(f)_
hereof) in such amount as Buyer Parties shall require and subject only to the
Title Policy Permitted Encumbrances, with such endorsements as Parent shall
reasonably require, including, without limitation, the endorsements set forth
on the new owners policy of title insurance in the form of _Exhibit J_,
together with such co-insurance or re-insurance as Parent shall reasonably
require (the " _New Title Policy_ "). In furtherance of the foregoing, at
Parents option and at its sole cost and expense, Parent may obtain updated
and recertified versions of the most recent ALTA surveys for the Owned Real
Property or current, certified ALTA surveys with respect to the Owned Real
Property, and the Companies shall

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably cooperate with Parent in connection with the foregoing. For the
avoidance of doubt, all costs and expenses of obtaining the New Title Policy
shall be borne by Parent.

 



 

Section 4.13 _Termination of Affiliate Contracts_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.13_ , HoldCo shall and shall cause the Companies and their
respective Affiliates to terminate the Affiliate Contracts effective as of the
Closing Date (the " _Termination of Affiliate Contracts_ "). The Termination
of Affiliate Contracts (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the termination
of any Affiliate Contracts that terminate or expire automatically at Closing
in accordance with their terms) shall be without Liability or loss to the
Companies, including as to Liabilities or losses remaining under any Affiliate
Contracts.

 



 

Section 4.14 _Awards and Proceeds_. If neither Parent nor Operator elects to,
and neither is entitled to, terminate this Agreement following any notice of
any Casualty/Condemnation Claim, then this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and the transactions contemplated herein shall be effected
with no further adjustments, except as set forth in the succeeding sentence.
At the Closing, HoldCo shall retain all right, title and interest in and to
any awards, payments or insurance proceeds available to any of the Companies
or in which any of the Companies has an interest for the damage to, or
diminution in value of, the Companies, the Business, and/or the Real Property
that is the subject of the Casualty/Condemnation Claim, as the case may be,
and that has been or may thereafter be made for any such Casualty/Condemnation
Claim, to the extent such awards, payments or proceeds shall not have
theretofore been used for restoration of the Business, and/or the Real
Property. Additionally, at the Closing, Operator shall be credited, in the
form of a reduction to the Purchase Price, in the amount of any deductibles
due under any applicable insurance policies with respect to such
Casualty/Condemnation Claim, except to the extent such deductibles due are
included in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital. Furthermore,
Stockholder Representative shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer Parties in
the adjustment and settlement of any insurance claim. The provisions of this
_Section 4.14_ shall survive the Closing.

 



 

Section 4.15 _R andW Insurance Policy_. The Buyer Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the RandW Insurance Policy to be bound prior to the
Closing, including by paying the RandW Insurance Cost when due and payable.
Prior to the Closing, the Companies agree to cooperate with the Buyer Parties
and provide such assistance as the Buyer Parties may reasonably request
related to obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy.

if Parent or any of its affiliates fail to comply with all such requirements
and conditions resulting in Title Insurers failure to issue such commitment,
such Title Insurers commitment to issue the New Title Policy shall not be a
condition precedent to the Buyer Parties obligations under this Agreement.

correct in all respects) and (ii) all other representations and warranties of
Buyer Parties set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct both as of

Closing (except that those representations and warranties that address matters
only as of a particular date need only be true and correct as of such date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true

individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Buyer Parties
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Buyer Parties shall have performed in all material respects (or shall have
caused the performance in all material respects of) all covenants, obligations

 **ARTICLE 6.** ** 
_TERMINATION_**

 



 

Section 6.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents may be abandoned at any time prior
to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of HoldCo and Buyer Parties;

 



 

(b) by either HoldCo or Buyer Parties, if the Closing does not occur prior to
the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 6.1(b)_ shall not be available to either HoldCo
or Buyer Parties if such Partys failure to fulfill any obligation of such
Party (treating the Buyer Parties as one Party) under this Agreement has been
the primary cause of the failure of the Closing to occur prior to the Outside
Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event of a Parent Conditions Event,
then (A) Buyer Parties shall only be permitted to terminate this Agreement
with respect to Parent, and (B) in the event of such termination only with
respect to Parent, HoldCo and Operator shall take the actions described in
_Section 6.5_;

 



 

(c) [Intentionally omitted];

 



 

(d) by Buyer Parties, if:

 



 

(i) no Buyer Party is then in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement and there has been a breach of, inaccuracy in or failure to perform
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by or on behalf of
any of the Companies pursuant to this Agreement, such that the conditions
specified in _Section 5.2(a)_ or _Section 5.2(b)_ would not be satisfied at
Closing, in each case which shall not have been cured to the reasonable
satisfaction of Buyer Parties within 30 Business Days following notice of the
same to HoldCo; or

 



 

(ii) it becomes impossible (without the possibility of a cure) for any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 5.1_ or _Section 5.2_ (other than those
conditions set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(b)_) to be
satisfied by the Outside Date, unless such failure shall be due to the failure
of any Buyer Party to perform or comply (or to cause the performance or
compliance) with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be
performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that if
such impossibility primarily relates to a Parent Conditions Event, then (A)
Buyer Parties shall only be permitted to terminate this Agreement with respect
to Parent and (B) in the event of such termination only with respect to
Parent, HoldCo and Operator shall take the actions described in _Section
6.5_;

 



 

(e) by HoldCo, if:

 



 

(i) none of the Companies is then in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement and there has been a breach of, inaccuracy in or failure to perform
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by any Buyer Party
pursuant to this Agreement, such that the conditions specified in _Section
5.3(a)_ or _Section 5.3(b)_ would not be satisfied at Closing, in each case

 



       
 

 



 

which shall not have been cured to the reasonable satisfaction of HoldCo
within 30 Business Days following notice of the same to Buyer Parties; or

 



 

(ii) it becomes impossible (without the possibility of a cure) for any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 5.1_ or _Section 5.3_ (other than those
conditions set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_ and _Section 5.3(b)_) to be
satisfied by the Outside Date, unless such failure shall be due to the failure
of HoldCo to perform or comply (or to cause the performance or compliance)
with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or
complied with by it prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
such impossibility primarily relates to a Parent Conditions Event, then (A)
HoldCo may elect to terminate this Agreement only with respect to Parent and
(B) in the event of such termination only with respect to Parent, HoldCo and
Operator shall take the actions described in _Section 6.5_;

 



 

(f) by either HoldCo or Buyer Parties, (i) if any Buyer Party shall formally
and finally withdraw any of its respective applications for the Closing Gaming
Approvals, or (ii) if any Gaming Authority shall have made a final and non-
appealable determination, including issuing any Order, that it will not issue
the Closing Gaming Approvals on or prior to the applicable Outside Date or
advised any Buyer Party or its respective Affiliates to withdraw any
application for any Closing Gaming Approval for the continuation of the
Business as presently conducted following the consummation of the Merger (and
has not advised such Person to re-submit such application with modifications
thereto); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 6.1(f)(ii)_ in the event that such Party or its
Affiliates have failed to fulfill any obligation of such Party under this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or have breached any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of such Party set forth
in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and such failure or
breach was the primary reason the Gaming Authority made such determination not
to issue the Closing Gaming Approvals; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
actions described in clauses (i) or (ii) of this _Section 6.1(f)_ primarily
relate to a Parent Conditions Event, then (A) Buyer Parties may only terminate
this Agreement with respect to Parent and (B) in the event of such termination
only with respect to Parent, HoldCo and Operator shall take the actions
described in _Section 6.5_;

 



 

(g) by Buyer Parties, if, after the date hereof, the Property is the subject
of a Major Casualty/Condemnation; or

 



 

(h) by Buyer Parties, if HoldCo has not obtained evidence of the Requisite
HoldCo Vote within forty-eight (48) hours of the date of this Agreement as
required by _Section 4.5(a)_.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Notice_. In the event of a termination of this Agreement by
HoldCo, Parent or Operator pursuant to this _Section 6.1_, written notice
thereof shall be given promptly to the other Parties. If the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents are terminated as provided herein,
Parent, Operator and HoldCo shall each return to the other all documents and
other material received from the delivering Party relating to the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.3 _Effect of Termination_. Other than as set forth in _Section
6.5_, if this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents are abandoned as described in _Section 6.1_, this
Agreement shall become null and void, and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of the Parties, except with respect to _Section 4.6_ (
_Public Announcements_ ) _;_ _Section 4.10_ ( _Confidentiality_ ), this
_Section 6.3_ ( _Effect of Termination_ ), _Section 6.4_ ( _Payment upon
Termination_ ) and _Article 10_ ( _Miscellaneous_ ) _; provided_ , _however_
, that except as set forth in _Section 6.4(b)_, nothing in this _Section
6.3_ relieves any Party of any liability for fraud or any Willful Breach of
any covenant or agreement contained herein occurring prior to termination, in
which case the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
available at law or in equity; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 6.3_ or otherwise in this
Agreement to the contrary, any potential liability against a Party in
accordance with this _Section 6.3_, other than any liability for fraud or any
Willful Breach, shall specifically exclude the right of the aggrieved Party to
claim expectation, consequential, liquidated or similar damages. " _Willful
Breach_ " means an intentional and willful material breach, or an intentional
and willful material failure to perform, in each case that is the consequence
of an act or omission by a Party with the Knowledge that the taking of, or
failure to take, such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause a
material breach of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Payment upon Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated with respect to all parties
pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_, _Section 6.1(e)(ii)_ or _Section 6.1(f)_ and,
in each case, any of the conditions set forth in _Section 5.1(a)_ (if the
applicable Law or Order relates to the Closing Gaming Approvals, or antitrust
Laws), _Section 5.1(b)(i)_ (with respect to the Closing Gaming Approvals) or
_Section 5.1(c)_ shall not have been satisfied and all of the conditions set
forth in _Section 5.2_ have been satisfied as of the date of such termination
(or were capable of being satisfied as of the Closing Date, if it had
occurred), then in any such case, within three (3) Business Days after
termination of this Agreement, Operator shall pay to HoldCo the Termination
Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by HoldCo.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated with respect to all parties pursuant to
_Section 6.1(b)_, _Section 6.1(e)(ii)_ or _Section 6.1(f)_ and the
Termination Fee is paid to HoldCo in accordance with _Section 6.4(a)_ above,
then the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Companies, and any Affiliates, officers, directors, employees or
Representatives of any of the Companies, against any Buyer Party or any of
their Representatives or Affiliates for, and in no event will any of the
Companies seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy
based on a claim in Law or equity with respect to, and the Companies shall be
deemed to have waived all other remedies (including equitable remedies) with
respect to, (i) any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated, (ii) the termination of this Agreement, (iii) any liabilities
or obligations arising under this Agreement, or (iv) any claims or actions
arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of or under
this Agreement, and upon the payment to HoldCo of the Termination Fee (but
only to the extent such amount is payable) no Buyer Party nor any of their
respective Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or
obligation to the

 



      
 

 



 

Companies relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ that if Buyer Parties fail to pay the
Termination Fee and HoldCo commences a suit against Buyer Parties for the
Termination Fee or any portion thereof and prevails in such suit, then Buyer
Parties shall pay HoldCo its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the Termination Fee at the "prime rate" as published in The Wall
Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis
of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without
compounding).

 



 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) it would be impractical and
extremely difficult to fix the actual damages that the Companies might suffer
in the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_,
_Section 6.1(e)(ii)_ or _Section 6.1(f)_ and that the amount of liquidated
damages provided for in _Section 6.4(a)_ is a fair and reasonable estimate of
such damages and (ii) in no event will any Buyer Party be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion, nor shall any Buyer Party be
required to pay the Termination Fee if the Termination Fee was paid by any
other Party to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Alternative Structure Upon a Parent Conditions Event_.

 



 

(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement solely with respect to
Parent pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_, _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_, _Section
6.1(e)(ii)_ or _Section 6.1(f)_, HoldCo and Operator shall amend this
Agreement as appropriate to (a) make Guarantor the "Parent" entity (" _New
Parent_ ") and make "Merger Sub" a wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor, (b)
have New Parent agree to perform all obligations of Buyer Parties under this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment of the Closing
Merger Consideration), (c) eliminate references to the Restructuring
Transactions, (d) eliminate any limitations on actions that Parent is or is
not required, as applicable, to take under this Agreement related to Parents
qualification as a real estate investment trust under the Code or the matters
described in clause (ii)(y) of _Schedule 5.1(b)(i)_ and (e) make other
changes consistent with the foregoing.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated solely with respect to Parent pursuant to
_Section 6.1(b)_, _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_, _Section 6.1(e)(ii)_ or _Section
6.1(f)_, then such termination shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Companies, and any Affiliates, officers, directors, Stockholders, employees or
Representatives of any of the Companies, (x) against Parent or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates for, and (y) in no event will any of the
Companies seek to recover from Parent, directly or indirectly, and will not
assist or encourage, directly or indirectly any other Person in seeking to
recover from Parent, any money damages or seek any other remedy against Parent
based on a claim in Law or equity with respect to, and (z) the Companies shall
be deemed to have waived all other remedies against Parent (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, equitable remedies and the Termination Fee or any portion
thereof) with respect to, (i) any loss suffered as a result of the failure of
the Merger to be consummated, (ii) the termination of this Agreement with
respect to Parent, (iii) any liabilities or obligations of Parent arising
under this Agreement, or (iv) any claims or actions arising out of or relating
to any

 



      
 

 



 

breach, termination with respect to Parent or failure of or under this
Agreement, and neither Parent nor any of its Stockholders, Representatives or
Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation to the Companies or
any Affiliates, officers, directors, Stockholders, employees or
Representatives of any of the Companies relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as described in the
foregoing, such amendment shall not otherwise modify any other terms of this
Agreement.

Document) and (v) any Taxes that accrue or are attributable to the ownership

(determined in accordance with the methodology for allocating Taxes with
respect to Straddle Periods).

 



 

(d) In calculating the amount of any Damages payable to a Buyer Indemnified
Party hereunder, (x) the amount of the Damages (i) shall not be duplicative of
any other Damages for which an indemnification claim has been made, and (ii)
shall be reduced by any amounts actually recovered by such Buyer Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates under any insurance policy with respect to such
Damages, net of costs related to receiving such insurance payment, and (y) any

paid by the Stockholders in respect of such claim to Stockholder
Representative.

party in connection with a Third-Party Claim).

hold harmless any Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Damages to the extent any
such Damages arise solely from or relate solely to a change in use or zoning

HoldCo had Knowledge of such change before the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) All claims for Damages made by any Buyer Indemnified Party under _Section

Escrow Agreement, except in the case of fraud, in which case the
Indemnification Escrow Account will be available as the primary source of
recovery for Buyer Indemnified Parties for indemnification obligations of the
Stockholders under _Section 7.2_ (other than _Section 7.2(j)_); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, subject to _Section 7.4(a)_, claims pursuant to _Section

remedy based on representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted or knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance
with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

any Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
such Third-Party Claim and the amount or the estimated amount of Damages
sought thereunder (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount
of such Third-Party Claim) (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect the rights of an
Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
is materially and irrevocably prejudiced by such failure and unless the
Indemnified Party fails to give notice in accordance with this _Section 7.5_
prior to the expiry of the applicable Survival Period. The Indemnifying Party
shall have 30 days after receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified
Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party
Claim.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within such 30-day period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate Legal Proceedings ( _provided_
that counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party), (ii)
subject to the immediately succeeding sentence and _Section 7.5(c)(ii)_, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of such
Claim at its own expense and shall not settle or compromise the Third-Party
Claim, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall have the power and authority to
settle or consent to the entry of judgment in respect of the Third-Party Claim
without the consent of the Indemnified Party if the judgment or settlement
results only in the payment by the Indemnifying Party of the full amount of
money damages without any admission of wrongdoing of any nature whatsoever to
or by such Indemnified Party and includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party from any and all liability thereunder, and, in all other
events, the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of judgment or
enter into any settlement in respect of a Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned). If the Indemnified Party shall participate in any
such defense, it shall participate at its sole cost and expense, unless (A)
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the
Legal Proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded
that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate, due to actual or potential differing interests between them, or
(B) the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim after the
Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently defend a Third-Party Claim it has
assumed, as provided in _Section 7.5(c)_, in either of which events the
Indemnifying Party shall bear the cost and expense of such participation to
the extent it is required to indemnify the Indemnified Party therefor under
this _Article 7_.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, or (ii) after assuming
the defense of a Third-Party

 



      
 

 



 

Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such
Third-Party Claim within 10 days after receiving written notice from the
Indemnified Party stating that the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to provide its
own defense and to settle or compromise the Third-Party Claim with the consent
of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

 



 

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by
providing access to each others relevant business records and other
documents, and employees (including, if necessary, availability for
depositions and testifying), _provided_ that no such cooperation shall be
required to the extent such cooperation, on the reasonable advice of counsel,
will reasonably be likely to result in the loss of the attorney-client
privilege.

 



 

(e) In the event any Indemnified Party desires to assert a claim for
indemnification under this _Article 7_ with respect to any matter not
involving a Third-Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify
the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Claim (and make any other
notifications required under the Escrow Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure to provide such a notice shall not affect the rights of an
Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
was materially and irrevocably prejudiced by such failure and unless the
Indemnified Party fails to give notice in accordance with this _Section 7.5_
prior to the expiry of the applicable Survival Period.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Satisfaction of the Indemnification Obligations_. At any time
that there are any funds remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account or,
with respect to a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section _ _7.2(j)_ ,
the Sales and Use Tax Proceeding Indemnification Escrow Account, the
Stockholders shall satisfy their obligations under this _Article 7_ in
respect of a claim for indemnification hereunder first by Stockholder
Representative delivering a joint instruction with Parent and Operator to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse funds from the Escrow
Account to Parent and/or Operator, as applicable, in the amount claimed. For
the avoidance of doubt, except in the case of fraud, the sole sources of
indemnification against the Stockholders shall be the Indemnification Escrow
Account and, with respect to a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section
_ _7.2(j)_ , the Sales and Use Tax Proceeding Indemnification Escrow Account
and the Indemnification Escrow Account.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties agree to treat
any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article 7 as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes unless otherwise required pursuant to
Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to (a) claims based on
fraud and (b) claims for specific performance in accordance with _Section
10.10_, following the Closing, indemnification pursuant to this _Article 7_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties and any parties claiming
by or through any Party (including the Indemnified Parties) related to or
arising from any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in, or otherwise pursuant to, this Agreement, and none of the
Parties shall have any other rights or remedies in connection with any breach
of this Agreement or any other liability

 



      
 

 



 

arising out of the negotiation, entry into or consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort, strict
liability, other Laws or otherwise.

 



 

Section 7.9 _No Subrogation_. Following the Closing, no Indemnifying Party
shall have any right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation against
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any indemnification
made by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party under _Section 7.3_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 8.** ** 
_POST-CLOSING COVENANTS_**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Preservation of Records_. Each Party agrees that it shall
preserve and keep the records held by it or its Affiliates relating to the
operation of the Business prior to the Closing Date for a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date and shall make such records and personnel
available to the others as may be reasonably required by such Party in
connection with, among other things, any insurance Claims by, Legal
Proceedings against or governmental investigations of such other Party or any
of its or their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, or in order to
enable such other Party to comply with its obligations under the Transaction
Documents. In the event a Party wishes to destroy (or permit to be destroyed)
such records after that time, such Party shall first give 90 calendar days
prior written notice to the other and the notified Party shall have the right,
at its option and expense, upon prior written notice given to the notifying
Party within such 90-day period, to take possession of the records within 180
calendar days after the date of such notice.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Employees_. Operator expects, but is not obligated, to cause OpCo
to retain the Employees following the Effective Time. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) Parent shall not be required to retain, or to cause the Companies
or Operator to retain, any Employee following the Effective Time and (ii)
Operator shall not be required to retain, or to cause the Companies or Parent
to retain, any Employee following the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 8.3 _D andO Tail_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, HoldCo shall purchase and pay the full premium with
respect to an extended reporting period endorsement under HoldCos existing
directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability policies to provide
directors and officers of the Companies prior to the Closing with run-off
coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing for a period
of six (6) years after the Closing (the " _D andO Tail_"). Neither Parent nor
Operator shall, nor shall Parent or Operator cause HoldCo to, take any action
that results in the cancellation or termination of, or amend or otherwise
modify, the DandO Tail. The cost of the DandO Tail shall be borne by HoldCo and
shall be included in the Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(b) The obligations of Parent and Operator under this _Section 8.3_ shall
survive the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section 8.3_ applies
without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed
that the indemnitees to whom this

 



       
 

 



 

 _Section 8.3_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section
8.3_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section 8.3_).

 



 

 **ARTICLE 9.** ** 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 9.1 _Tax Covenants_.

 



 

(a) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with the Merger (including any real property transfer Tax and
any other similar Tax) shall be paid one-half by the Stockholders, on the one
hand, and one-half by Buyer Parties, on the other hand, when due. Stockholder
Representative and Buyer Parties shall fully cooperate with each other with
respect to the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns or other filings
related to such Taxes and fees.

 



 

(b) At the request of Stockholder Representative, Buyer Parties and the
Companies shall apply for any Tax refund available to the Companies for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period. To the extent attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, with respect to any Tax refund (including any interest in respect
thereof) received directly or indirectly by any Buyer Party or the Companies
during the applicable Survival Period or in response to a claim made by Buyer
Parties or the Companies during the applicable Survival Period, including any
amounts of overpayments of Tax (including payments of estimated Tax) with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer Parties shall in each case pay over
in cash to Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders, any such
amounts within ten (10) days following the receipt of any such refund
(including any interest in respect thereof) or credit or reduction in Tax
liability received directly or indirectly by Buyer Parties or the Companies as
a result of such refund. Any amounts that are not timely paid pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(b)_ shall accrue interest at the rate prescribed under Section
6621(a)(1) of the Code, compounded annually, until the payment thereof by
Buyer Parties.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, without the prior written consent of
Stockholder Representative, Buyer Parties shall not, and shall cause the
Companies not to, make or change any material Tax election for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, take any Tax position on any Tax Return (including an amended Tax
Return) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, take any action that would reduce any
Tax refund or credit to which the Stockholders would be entitled for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, compromise or settle any Tax liability for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, or take any action outside of the ordinary course of business with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, if such action reasonably
could have the effect of decreasing the amounts payable to the Stockholders
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ above or reasonably could adversely affect the
Tax liability of the Stockholders or their direct or indirect owners or could
otherwise adversely affect the Stockholders.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.2 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) HoldCo shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by it that are due on or before
the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions), and shall timely pay
all Taxes that are due and payable on or before the Closing Date (taking into
account any extensions). Any such Pre-Closing Tax Return shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with _Section 9.2(c)_ and past practice (unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law).

 



 

(b) Buyer Parties shall cause each Company to prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by
such Company after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with _Section
9.2(c)_ and past practice (unless otherwise required by Applicable Law) and,
if it is an income or other material Tax Return, shall be submitted by Buyer
Parties to Stockholder Representative (together with schedules, statements
and, to the extent requested by Stockholder Representative, supporting
documentation) at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date (including
extensions) of such Tax Return. If Stockholder Representative objects to any
item on any such Tax Return that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, it
shall, within ten (10) days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Parent
in writing that it so objects, specifying with particularity any such item and
stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a
notice of objection shall be duly delivered, (i) in the case of a Tax Return
that relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, to the extent the
Stockholders have an obligation under _Article 7_ which has not expired or
lapsed, Stockholder Representatives objection shall control and shall be
taken into account on the applicable Tax Return unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law as reasonably determined by Buyer Parties and (ii) in the case
of any Tax Return that relates to a Straddle Period, Buyer Parties and
Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer Parties and
Stockholder Representative are unable to reach an agreement within ten (10)
days after receipt by Buyer Parties of such notice, the disputed items shall
be resolved by the Dispute Advisor and any determination by the Dispute
Advisor shall be final. The Dispute Advisor shall resolve any disputed items
within ten (10) days of having the item referred to it pursuant to such
procedures as it may require. If the Dispute Advisor is unable to resolve any
disputed items before the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall
be filed as prepared by Buyer Parties and then amended to reflect the Dispute
Advisors resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the Dispute Advisor
shall be borne equally by Buyer Parties and Stockholder Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision in this Agreement, the
Stockholders shall not be liable for any Taxes (A) that were taken into
account as liabilities in computing the Closing Net Working Capital, (B) that
were paid prior to the Closing (including through payments of estimated Taxes)
or (C) that were incurred as a result of actions taken by or at the direction
of Buyer Parties without the consent of Stockholder Representative, on the
Closing Date, outside of the ordinary course of business, or after the Closing
(including the Distributions, the Conversions and the Intermediate Sale). Any
overpayment of Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that was not taken into
account in computing the Closing Net Working Capital shall be paid to
Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Stockholders.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) For avoidance of doubt, (i) the income Tax Returns of the Companies for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall claim all deductions, including deductions
for net operating losses carryovers and carrybacks, in each case from a Pre-
Closing Tax Period to another Pre-Closing Tax Period to which the Companies
are entitled to claim consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required
by Applicable Law), and (ii) all Transaction Tax Deductions shall be claimed
in a Pre-Closing Tax Period unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, in
which case such amounts shall be treated as arising in a Pre-Closing Tax
Period for purposes of determining any indemnification obligations with
respect to, Taxes.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Straddle Period_. To the extent permitted or required by
Applicable Law, the Tax Periods of the Companies which include the Closing
Date shall be treated as closing on (and including) the Closing Date as of the
Effective Time. In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a
taxable period that begins before and ends on or after the Closing Date (each
such period, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such Taxes that are
treated as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this Agreement shall be:

 



 

(a) in the case of Taxes (i) based upon, or related to, income, receipts,
profits, wages, capital or net worth, or (ii) imposed in connection with the
sale, transfer or assignment of property, deemed to be the amount which would
be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date as of the
Effective Time; _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on and including the
Closing Date as of the Effective Time and the period beginning after the
Closing Date as of the Effective Time in proportion to the number of days in
each period; and

 



 

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in the period ending on the Closing Date as of the Effective Time and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Contests_.

 



 

(a) Buyer Parties and the Companies shall promptly forward to Stockholder
Representative all written notifications and other communications from any
Taxing Authority relating to any Tax liability of the Companies with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or any actions with respect to the same. The
failure of Buyer Parties or the Companies to deliver such written notice in
such period shall not affect the rights of an Indemnified Party under _Article
7_ with respect to any Tax or Damage directly or indirectly related to the
subject matter of such written notification or other communication except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially and irrevocably
prejudiced by the failure to provide such written notice.

 



 

(b) (i) Stockholder Representative (at Stockholders expense, which shall be
paid solely from the Stockholder Representative Expense Amount first and then
from the Indemnification Escrow Account without regard to the Deductible)
shall control any

 



      
 

 



 

audit or examination by any taxing authority or any other judicial or
administrative proceeding with respect to Taxes, and contest, resolve and
defend against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency
or other adjustment of Taxes of the Companies (each, a " _Tax Matter_ ") for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (but for this purpose excluding any Straddle
Period) but only to the extent the Stockholders have an obligation with
respect to any such Tax Matter under _Article 7_, including through recovery
against the Indemnification Escrow Account, which has not expired or lapsed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Stockholder Representative shall provide to
Buyer Parties (at Buyer Parties expense, which expense shall not be subject
to indemnification under _Article 7_) reasonable participation rights with
respect to so much of such Tax Matter that is reasonably likely to affect the
Tax liability of Buyer Parties or the Companies for any Post-Closing Tax
Period. Stockholder Representative shall not assert any defenses or claims,
enter into any settlement of, or otherwise compromise, any such Tax Matter
that reasonably could adversely affect the liability of Buyer Parties or the
Companies for any Taxes, as to which the Stockholders would not be liable
hereunder, without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If Buyer Parties object
to any action that Stockholder Representative proposes to take pursuant to the
preceding sentence, Buyer Parties shall, within thirty (30) days after
delivery from Stockholder Representative of written notice of the intent to
take such action, notify Stockholder Representative in writing that it so
objects, specifying with particularity the objectionable action and stating
the specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of
objection shall be duly delivered, Buyer Parties and Stockholder
Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer Parties and Stockholder
Representative are unable to reach such agreement within ten (10) days after
receipt by Stockholder Representative of such notice, the disputed items shall
be resolved by the Dispute Advisor and any determination by the Dispute
Advisor shall be final. The Dispute Advisor shall resolve any disputed items
within ten (10) days of having the item referred to it pursuant to such
procedures as it may require. The costs, fees and expenses of the Dispute
Advisor shall be borne equally by Buyer Parties and Stockholder
Representative.

 



 

(ii) To the extent the Stockholders have an obligation which has not expired
or lapsed under _Article 7_ with respect to a Tax Matter for any Straddle
Period, Stockholder Representative and Buyer Parties shall have joint control
over any Tax Matter for such Straddle Period, with each party bearing any
expense it incurs in such Tax Matters (and such expenses of Buyer Parties
shall not be subject to indemnification under _Article _7); _provided_ , that
neither party will enter into any settlement of, or otherwise compromise, any
such Tax Matter that would adversely affect the liability of the other party
for Taxes without the prior written consent of such other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If Buyer Parties
and Stockholder Representative are unable to reach such agreement, the
disputed items shall be resolved by the Dispute Advisor and any determination
by the Dispute Advisor shall be final. The Dispute Advisor shall resolve any
disputed items within ten (10) days of having the item referred to it pursuant
to such procedures as it may require. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Dispute Advisor shall be borne equally by Buyer Parties and Stockholder
Representative.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If, after receiving written notice of a Tax Matter, Stockholder
Representative notifies a Buyer Party that it declines to exercise its control
rights pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ above with respect to a Tax Matter
covered by _Section 9.4(b)_, Buyer Parties and the Companies shall control
the conduct of such Tax Matter; _provided_ , that Buyer Parties and the
Companies shall (i) keep Stockholder Representative apprised of the status of
such Tax Matter, including by giving Stockholder Representative advance notice
of, and opportunity to attend at its expense, any in-person or telephonic
meetings, (ii) provide copies of any written correspondence or other
submissions received from a Taxing Authority with respect to such Tax Matter,
(iii) provide copies of any written correspondence to be provided to any
Taxing Authority in connection with such Tax Matter to Stockholder
Representative for Stockholder Representatives review and comment, with all
reasonable comments of Stockholder Representative to be reflected in such
correspondence or submission, and (iv) not enter into any settlement of, or
otherwise compromise, any such Tax Matter, without the prior written consent
of Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. If Buyer Parties and Stockholder
Representative are unable to reach such agreement, the disputed items shall be
resolved by the Dispute Advisor and any determination by the Dispute Advisor
shall be final. The Dispute Advisor shall resolve any disputed items within
ten (10) days of having the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as
it may require. The costs, fees and expenses of the Dispute Advisor shall be
borne equally by Buyer Parties and Stockholder Representative.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Stockholder
Representative, the Companies and Buyer Parties shall provide each other with
such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of
the others in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this _Article 9_ or in
connection with any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes of the
Companies. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying
schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by tax authorities. Each of Stockholder Representative, the
Companies and Buyer Parties shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters
of the Companies for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date for
a period of seven (7) years following Closing, and for such other reasonable
period thereafter as may be necessitated by any audits, examinations or
administrative or judicial appeals which may be ongoing at the end of such
period. Prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any Tax Returns,
schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its possession
relating to Tax matters of the Companies for any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date, Stockholder Representative, the Companies or Buyer
Parties (as the case may be) shall provide the other parties with reasonable
written notice and offer the other parties the opportunity to take custody of
such materials.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Overlap_. To the extent that any obligation or responsibility
pursuant to _Article 7_ may overlap with an obligation or responsibility
pursuant to this _Article 9_, the provisions of this _Article 9_ shall
govern.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Tax Benefit_. If any indemnity payments are made from the Escrow
Account on behalf of or by the Stockholders under _Article 7_, and the
payment or event

 



      
 

 



 

giving rise to such payment results in a reduction in the U.S. federal, state,
local or foreign Tax liability of Buyer Parties or the Companies, then (i) any
indemnity amount to be paid under _Article 7_ shall be reduced by the amount
of such reduction in Tax actually realized prior to the indemnity payment, and
(ii) to the extent such reduction in Tax is actually realized after the
indemnity payment under _Article 7_ is paid on behalf of the Stockholders but
no later than the end of the third taxable year ending after the Taxable year
in which the indemnity payment is made, Buyer Parties shall pay to Stockholder
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) the amount of such reduction in
Tax. Buyer Parties and the Companies shall utilize any available Tax benefit
in accordance with Applicable Law and, at the request of Stockholder
Representative, such Tax benefit shall be verified in writing by an
independent certified public accounting firm selected by Stockholder
Representative.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Payments to Stockholder Representative_. Stockholder
Representative may direct any payments to which it is entitled under this
_Article 9_ to be made to the Exchange Agent, which amount shall be deposited
in the Exchange Fund and shall be distributed to the Common Stockholders and
the Series B Stockholders in accordance with their respective Applicable
Percentages.

Section 10.5 _Delays or Omissions_. Except as expressly provided herein, no
delay or omission to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing to a Party
upon any breach or default of another Party under this Agreement shall impair
any such right, power or remedy of the non-breaching Party, nor shall it be
construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence
therein, or a waiver of or acquiescence in any similar breach or default
thereafter occurring, nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be
deemed a waiver of any other breach or default theretofore or thereafter
occurring. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on
the part of any Party of any breach or default under this Agreement, or any
waiver on the part of any Party of any provisions or conditions of this
Agreement, must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent

Agreement, the non-breaching Parties shall be entitled to seek (i) a decree or
order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant or obligation, and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach, in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is
entitled at law or in equity; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a Party may not seek specific
performance if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_,
_Section 6.1(e)(ii)_ or _Section 6.1(f)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that no
Party may seek specific performance unless all of the conditions set forth in
_Section 5.1_, _Section 5.2_ and _Section 5.3_ (other than those conditions
relating to the Party against whom specific performance is being sought) have
been satisfied as of the date of such termination (or were capable of being
satisfied as of the Closing Date, if it had occurred). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, no Party may cause Parent or
Merger Sub to specifically perform any obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a) if this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement is terminated solely with respect to Parent in accordance with the
applicable provisions of _Section 6.1(b)_, _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_, _Section
6.1(e)(ii)_ or _Section 6.1(f)_ or (b) unless Operator (x) has irrevocably
confirmed in writing to HoldCo, and HoldCo has irrevocably confirmed in
writing to Parent, that if specific performance is granted, Operator stands
and will stand ready, willing and able to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation by delivery of
the Operator Closing Merger Consideration at the Closing in accordance with
_Section 1.14(a)(ii)_ or (y) is also being required to specifically perform
its obligation to consummate the transactions consummated by this Agreement;
_it being understood_ that the foregoing shall not limit in any way HoldCos
right to seek Operator to specifically perform its obligations under _Section
6.5_.

 



 

(b) Each Party hereto further agrees that no Parties shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.10_,
and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Jurisdiction and Venue; Waiver of Trial by Jury; Limitation on
Claims_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or in the event (but only in
the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over a
Legal Proceeding, to the other courts of the State of Delaware or the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware, and to the jurisdiction of
any appellate courts to which any appeals therefrom are available
(collectively, the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and hereby waives, and agrees not to
assert, as a defense in any such Legal Proceeding that it is not subject
thereto or that such Legal Proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in the Chosen Courts, or that any Transaction Document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties irrevocably agree that all
claims for specific performance or injunctive relief with respect to any such
Legal Proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Chosen Courts. The
Parties hereby consent to and grant the Chosen Courts jurisdiction over the
person of such Parties and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, over
the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such Legal Proceeding in the manner provided in
this Agreement or in such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE
EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE

 



       
 

 



 

IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND
(D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.11(B)_.

 



 

(c) All claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be
based upon, in respect of, arise under, out of or by reason of, be connected
with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty
made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be
made only against (and are those solely of) (i) the entities that are
expressly identified as Parties in the preamble to this Agreement, and (ii)
each Stockholder who executes a Letter of Transmittal, but only with respect
to such claims that may be brought directly against or from each Stockholder
pursuant to _Section 7.4(g)_ or as set forth in the Letter of Transmittal,
and subject to the limitations set forth in Article VII and the Letter of
Transmittal (together, " _Contracting Parties_ "), except to the extent
otherwise set forth herein. No Person who is not a Contracting Party,
including, without limitation, any past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, direct or indirect
equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or Representative of any Contracting
Party, or any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, direct or indirect equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
Representative of any of the foregoing (" _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have
any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted
by statute) for any obligations or liabilities of any Contracting Party
arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this
Agreement (including its negotiation, execution, performance or breach) or for
any claims or causes of action based on, in respect of, or by reason of the
sale and purchase of the Companies (including, without limitation, any non-
disclosure or misrepresentations made by any such Nonparty Affiliates) or any
other transactions; and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, each
Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims,
causes of action, and obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates.
Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, (i)
each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims,
demands or causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or in
equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a
Contracting Party or otherwise impose liability of a Contracting Party on any
Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity,
agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business
enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization or otherwise;
and (ii) each Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty
Affiliates with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement, in each case, except to the extent otherwise set forth herein.

 



 

(d) The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities
and obligations with respect to the Transaction exclusively in contract
pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, and the Parties expressly disclaim that they are owed
any duties or are entitled to any remedies

 



      
 

 



 

not expressly set forth in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents,
other than for claims by HoldCo against a Buyer Party for fraud of such Buyer
Party and claims by a Buyer Party against HoldCo for fraud of HoldCo (as
claims for fraud have been excluded to the maximum extent permitted by Law
pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents). The sole and exclusive remedies for any and all claims or causes
of action arising under, out of, or related to this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents (including any representations and warranties set forth
herein or therein, made in connection herewith or therewith or as an
inducement to enter into this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents) or
any claim or cause of action otherwise arising under, out of, or related to
the Transaction, other than for claims by HoldCo against a Buyer Party for
fraud of such Buyer Party and claims by a Buyer Party against HoldCo for fraud
of HoldCo (as claims for fraud have been limited to the maximum extent
permitted by Law pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents), shall be those remedies available at law or in equity
for breach of contract against the Parties to this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents only (as such contractual remedies have been further
limited or excluded pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents) and no Person will have any other entitlement,
remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, it being agreed
that all of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly
waived and released by the Parties to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Construction; Interpretation_. This Agreement is the result of
the joint efforts of the Parties, and each provision hereof has been subject
to the mutual consultation, negotiation and agreement of the Parties and there
is to be no construction for or against any party based on any presumption of
that partys involvement, or lack of involvement, in the drafting thereof. Any
reference to any federal, state, local or foreign Law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever used in this Agreement, except as otherwise
expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires, any noun or
pronoun shall be deemed to include the plural as well as the singular and to
cover all genders, and the terms "include" and "including" shall be inclusive
and not exclusive and, to the extent not already followed by the words
"without limitation" or "but not limited to," shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." Unless otherwise specified, the terms
"hereof," "herein," "hereunder," "herewith" and similar terms refer to this
Agreement as a whole (including the Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement),
and references herein to Sections and Articles refer to sections and articles
of this Agreement. All references herein to "Dollars" or "$" shall be deemed
to be references to U.S. Dollars. Any document, list or other item shall be
deemed to have been "made available" to Buyer Parties for all purposes hereof
only if such document, list or other item was posted at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the date hereof in the electronic data room established by
HoldCo in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Provisions Respecting Legal Representation_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its Representatives, that Milbank, Hadley, Tweed and McCloy LLP may
serve as counsel to Stockholder Representative, any Stockholder and/or their
respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " _Holder Group_ "),
on the one hand, and

 



      
 

 



 

HoldCo, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Milbank, Hadley, Tweed and McCloy LLP (or any

any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such Parties shall
cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation. Buyer Parties further agree that, as to all
communications prior to Closing between the Companies and Milbank, Hadley,

expectation of client confidence as the same relate or apply to any such
communications belongs to Stockholder Representative and the same may be
controlled by Stockholder Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed
or waived by Buyer Parties or the Companies. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, to the extent that Milbank, Hadley, Tweed and McCloy LLP has
represented any Company in any Action unrelated to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, as to all communications between Milbank,
Hadley, Tweed and McCloy LLP and such Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
attendant attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection, and
expectation of client confidentiality applicable thereto belongs to such
Company. Upon and after the Closing, the Companies shall cease to have any
attorney-client relationship with Milbank, Hadley, Tweed and McCloy LLP, unless
and to the extent Milbank, Hadley, Tweed and McCloy LLP is specifically engaged
in writing by the Companies to represent any of the Companies after the
Closing. Any such representation of the Companies by Milbank, Hadley, Tweed and
McCloy LLP after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its Representatives, that Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP has
served as counsel to Parent and/or its respective Affiliates (individually and
collectively, the " _Parent Group_ "), and that White and Williams LLP has
served as counsel to Operator and/or its respective Affiliates (individually
and collectively, the " _Operator Group_ "), in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, that such law firms may
serve as counsel to the Parent Group and/or the Operator Group in connection
with the defense of any potential claims of liability arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, and that the Parent Group and the Operator Group share a common
interest in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents and the defense of any potential claims of liability
arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other

representation as counsel and waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom, and each of such Parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof to
consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such representation.
Holder Group further agrees that, as to all communications prior to Closing
between or among the Parent Group, the Operator Group, Kramer Levin Naftalis and

mutual understanding of the Parties hereto (i) that the sharing of such
communications is not

of such materials or their continued protection under the attorney-client
privilege, the work product doctrine, the expectation of client confidence or
other applicable privileges, protections or immunities; and (ii) that all such
communications are entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege,
the work product doctrine, the expectation of client confidence or other

without the consent of the providing party. Holder Group further agrees that,
without limiting the effect of _Section 10.13(a)_ above, all privileges,

Section 10.14 _Stockholder Representative_.

 



 

(a) By approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or by

Transaction Documents, and to take any and all actions and make any decisions
required or permitted to be taken by Stockholder Representative pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other applicable Transaction
Documents, including the exercise of the power to:

 



 

(i) give and receive notices and communications;

 



 

(ii) authorize delivery to Parent and/or Operator, as applicable, of cash from

(viii) engage, employ or appoint any agents or Representatives (including
attorneys, accountants and consultants) to assist Stockholder Representative
in complying with its duties and obligations; and

 



 

(ix) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of
Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Buyer Parties shall be entitled to deal exclusively with Stockholder
Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported
to be executed on behalf of any Stockholder by Stockholder Representative, and
on any other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any
Stockholder by Stockholder Representative, as being fully binding upon such
Person. Notices or communications to or from Stockholder Representative shall
constitute notice to or from each of the Stockholders. Any decision or action
by Stockholder Representative hereunder, including any agreement between
Stockholder Representative and any Buyer Party relating to the defense,
payment or settlement of any claims for indemnification hereunder, shall
constitute a decision or action of all Stockholders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each such Person. No Stockholder shall have the
right to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same. The
provisions of this _Section 10.14_, including the power of attorney granted
hereby, are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an
interest and shall not be terminated by any act of any one or Stockholders, or
by operation of Law, whether by death or other event.

 



 

(c) Stockholder Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed for
any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of a majority in
interest of the Stockholders according to each Stockholders pro rata share of
the Merger Consideration (the " _Majority Holders_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall Stockholder Representative resign or be removed
without the Majority Holders having first appointed a new Stockholder
Representative who shall assume such duties immediately upon the resignation
or removal of Stockholder Representative. In the event of the death,
incapacity, resignation or removal of Stockholder Representative, a new
Stockholder Representative shall be appointed by the vote or written consent
of the Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy of the written consent
appointing such new Stockholder Representative and a written acceptance by the
new Stockholder Representative shall be sent to Parent and Operator, such
appointment to be effective upon the later of the date indicated in such
consent or the date such notice and acceptance is received by Parent and
Operator; _provided_ , that until such notice is received, Buyer Parties and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to rely on the decisions and
actions of the prior Stockholder Representative as described above.

 



 

(d) Except as otherwise provided herein, Stockholder Representative shall have
the sole discretion to use Stockholder Representative Expense Amount to pay
any

 



      
 

 



 

out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by Stockholder Representative in its
capacity as Stockholder Representative, including any attorneys, accountants
and other experts fees. Once Stockholder Representative determines, in its
discretion, that it will not incur any additional expenses in its capacity as
Stockholder Representative, it will distribute, at its sole expense, to the
Common Stockholders and Series B Stockholders, _pro rata_ in proportion to
each such Stockholders Applicable Percentage, the remaining unused portion of
Stockholder Representative Expense Amount, if any, without interest;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Stockholder Representative shall not distribute
any unused portion of the Stockholder Representative Expense Amount while
Stockholder Representative is exercising its control rights with respect to a
Tax Matter pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_; _provided further_ , _however_ ,
that in the event (i) the Stockholder Representative Expense Amount is, in the
opinion of Stockholder Representative, insufficient to satisfy those costs or
expenses referenced in the first sentence of this _Section 10.14(d)_, or (ii)
subsequent to distribution of any unused portion of the Stockholder
Representative Expense Amount pursuant to this _Section 10.14(d)_,
Stockholder Representative incurs any additional costs or expenses in its
capacity as Stockholder Representative (or in good faith believes it will do
so), then any amounts necessary to satisfy Stockholder Representative pursuant
to clauses (i) or (ii) of this _Section 10.14(d)_ shall be deducted from any
amounts that are otherwise payable to the Stockholders from the
Indemnification Escrow Account in connection with any distribution therefrom
to the Stockholders in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The Buyer Parties
shall provide reasonable assistance to Stockholder Representative in the
remittance of the remaining Stockholder Representative Expense Amount to the
Common Stockholders and Series B Stockholders.

 



 

(e) Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any Person for any act
of Stockholder Representative taken in good faith and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement ( _it being understood_ that any act done
or omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith), except to the extent any liability, loss,
damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense is actually incurred by such Person as
a proximate result of the willful misconduct or bad faith of Stockholder
Representative. Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any
liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred by
Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith, and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent that any such
liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense is the proximate
result of the willful misconduct or bad faith of Stockholder Representative.
Stockholder Representative Expense Amount shall be available to indemnify and
hold Stockholder Representative harmless against any liability, loss, damage,
penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred by Stockholder Representative arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent that any
such liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense is the proximate
result of the gross negligence or bad faith of Stockholder Representative.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and Operator, as applicable,
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide
Stockholder Representative with reasonable access to information about the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and the reasonable assistance of
their officers and employees for the purpose of performing Stockholder
Representatives duties and exercising its rights under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Stockholder Representative
shall not unreasonably interfere with any of the operations or business
activities of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 10.15 _Penn Guarantee_.

 



 

(a) Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees and promises
to HoldCo, in order to induce HoldCo to enter into this Agreement: (i) the
payment by Operator of the Operator Purchase Price and any other amounts
payable by Operator to HoldCo or the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement
as, when and to the extent the same shall become due and payable; and (ii) the
performance, fulfillment and observance of each agreement, condition,
covenant, obligation and undertaking of Operator under this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). If
Operator shall fail to pay any amounts due under this Agreement and/or the
Transaction Documents when and to the extent the same shall become due and
payable, or shall fail to perform, fulfill or observe any of the Guaranteed
Obligations in the manner provided in this Agreement, Guarantor will upon
written demand from Stockholder Representative promptly pay or cause to be
paid such amount or perform, fulfill or observe or cause to be performed,
fulfilled or observed such Guaranteed Obligations, as the case may be.

 



 

(b) The Guaranteed Obligations under this guaranty shall constitute an
absolute and unconditional present and continuing guarantee of payment and
performance to the extent provided herein and not of collectability, and shall
not be contingent upon any attempt by Stockholder Representative to enforce
payment or performance by Guarantor. The Guaranteed Obligations are not
subject to any counterclaim, setoff, deduction, abatement or defense (other
than the defense of actual payment or performance) based upon any claim
Guarantor or Operator may have against HoldCo or the Stockholders, and shall
remain in full force and effect without regard to: (i) any agreement or
modification to any of the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement
which may hereafter be made relating thereto, in each case in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement (other than any agreement or modifications to the
Guaranteed Obligations); (ii) any exercise, non-exercise or waiver by HoldCo
or the Stockholders of any right, power, privilege or remedy under or in
respect of this Agreement; (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution,
liquidation, reorganization or the like of Operator or Guarantor at any time;
or (iv) absence of any notice to, or knowledge by, Guarantor of the existence
or occurrence of any of the matters or events set forth in the foregoing
subparagraphs (i) through (iii).

 



 

(c) Guarantor unconditionally waives: (i) any and all notice of default, non-
performance or non-payment under this Agreement; and (ii) all notices which
may be required by Law or otherwise to preserve intact any rights of HoldCo or
the Stockholders

 



      
 

 



 

against Guarantor, including any demand, presentment or protest, or proof of
notice of non-payment under this Agreement.
