AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of the 4th day of May 2006, by and among VLP Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Panther_ "), Panther Subcorp, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Panther (" _Subcorp_ "), and The Sportsmans Guide, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (" _Garfield_ "). 

   

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Panther, Subcorp and Garfield have approved the acquisition of Garfield by Panther upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Panther, Subcorp and Garfield have approved this Agreement and the merger of Subcorp with and into Garfield (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, as amended (the " _MBCA_ "), and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

   

AGREEMENT 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual and dependent promises set forth in this Agreement, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I. 
 THE MERGER 

   

 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the MBCA, Subcorp shall be merged with and into Garfield at the Effective Time (as defined below). As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Subcorp shall cease and Garfield shall continue its existence as the surviving corporation of the Merger under the laws of the State of Minnesota as a wholly owned subsidiary of Panther. Garfield, in its capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_." 

  

 1.2. _Effective Time_. As promptly as possible on the Closing Date (as defined below), the parties to this Agreement shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota (the " _Minnesota Secretary of State_ ") articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") required by and executed in accordance with Section 615 of the MBCA. The Merger shall become effective when the Articles of Merger have been filed with the Minnesota Secretary of State or at such later time as shall be agreed upon by Panther and Garfield and specified in the Articles of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). Prior to the filing referred to in this Section 1.2, a closing (the " _Closing_ ") shall be held at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York, or such other 

   ##### 

  

 

place as the parties to this Agreement may agree on, as soon as practicable
(but in any event within three business days) following the satisfaction
(or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws (as defined below) waiver by
the parties entitled to the benefits thereof) of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be
satisfied until the Closing), or at such other place, time and date as
shall be agreed in writing between Panther and Garfield. The date on which
the Closing takes place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." 

   

 1.3. _Effects of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects as provided for in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the MBCA, including those set forth in Section 641 of the MBCA. 

  

 1.4. _Articles of Incorporation and By-laws_. The Articles of Merger shall provide, subject to Section 5.2(c), that, at the Effective Time, (a) the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended as of the Effective Time so as to contain the provisions, and only the provisions, contained immediately prior to the Effective Time in the Articles of Incorporation of Subcorp (the " _Subcorp Articles of Incorporation_ "), except for Article I of the Subcorp Articles of Incorporation, which shall read "The name of the corporation is Garfield, Inc." and (b) the By-laws of Subcorp (the " _Subcorp By-laws_ ") in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until amended in accordance with the MBCA. 

  

 1.5. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of Subcorp immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold the office of director of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the provisions of the applicable laws of the State of Minnesota and the Articles of Incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly qualified and elected. The officers selected by Panther immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the provisions of the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. On or prior to the Closing Date, Garfield shall deliver to Panther evidence satisfactory to Panther of the resignations of each of the directors and those officers (specified by Panther) of Garfield and its subsidiaries, such resignations to be effective as of the Effective Time. 

  

ARTICLE II. 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

   

 2.1. _Conversion of Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Garfield, Subcorp or the holders of any securities of Garfield or Subcorp: 

  

 (a) Each share of Garfield Common Stock (as defined below), par value $0.01 per share, of Garfield issued and held, immediately prior to the Effective Time, in Garfields treasury, and each share of Garfield Common Stock that is owned by Panther or Subcorp, shall   ##### 

  

  

  

automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (b) Each issued and outstanding share of Garfield Common Stock (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a), (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined below), and (iii) shares held by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Panther or Garfield (which shares shall remain outstanding, except that the number of such shares shall be adjusted in the Merger to maintain relative ownership percentages)) shall be converted into the right to receive $31 in cash, without interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all shares of Garfield Common Stock cancelled or converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a) or (b) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Garfield Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ " and each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of Garfield, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for shares of Garfield Common Stock held by them in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Shares _of Dissenting Shareholders_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Garfield Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") held by a Dissenting Shareholder (as defined below) shall not be converted as described in Section 2.1(b) but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the MBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that each share of Garfield Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Dissenting Shareholder who, after the Effective Time, loses his or her right of appraisal, pursuant to the MBCA, shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Garfield shall give Panther (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of shares of Garfield Common Stock received by Garfield and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Garfield shall not, without prior written consent of Panther, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Dissenting Shareholder_ " means any record holder or beneficial owner of Garfield Common Stock who complies with all provisions of the MBCA concerning the right of holders of Garfield Common Stock to dissent from the Merger and obtain fair value for their shares. 

   

 (d) Each issued and outstanding common share, par value $.01 per share, of Subcorp shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Panther shall enter into an agreement with Bank of America, or such other bank or trust company as may be designated by Panther and as shall be reasonably satisfactory to Garfield (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). No later than the Effective Time, Panther shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Garfield Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to make cash payments due under Section 2.1 (the   ##### 

  

  

  

" _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions from Panther, deliver the cash to be paid to the shareholders of
Garfield pursuant to Section 2.1(b) out of the Exchange Fund and, except as
otherwise provided in Section 2.2(d), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Panther shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the product of the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Garfield Common Stock represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Garfield Common Stock represented by any Certificate which is not registered in the transfer records of Garfield, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Garfield Common Stock may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other non-income taxes required by reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Panther that any such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Panther or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Garfield Common Stock such amounts as Panther or the Exchange Agent is required to withhold or deduct under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Panther or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be remitted in a timely manner to the appropriate taxing authorities and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Garfield Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Panther or the Exchange Agent. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into which the Garfield Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate has been converted. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. 

   

 (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Garfield shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Garfield Common Stock, which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as otherwise provided by law.   ##### 

  

  

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Garfield, Panther, Subcorp, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund, as reasonably directed by Panther, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Panther. 

   

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 2.3. _Treatment of Stock Options_. Each option to purchase shares of Garfield Common Stock granted pursuant to the Garfield Stock Incentive Plans (as defined below) (each, a " _Stock Option_ ") outstanding at the end of the day immediately before the Closing Date, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall, on the Closing Date prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled and the holder of such Stock Option shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of such cancelled Stock Option, an amount in cash, less any applicable Tax withholding, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Garfield Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Stock Option (the " _Option Shares_ ") multiplied by (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such Stock Option. Garfield will ensure that (i) the Garfield Stock Incentive Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and all awards issued under such plans shall be terminated and the provisions in any other plan, program, arrangement or agreement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the equity interests of Garfield or any of its subsidiaries shall be of no further force or effect and shall be deemed to be terminated as of the Effective Time, (ii) no holder of a Stock Option or any participant in any Garfield Stock Incentive Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any securities of Garfield, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof or to receive any payment or benefit with respect to any award under a Garfield Stock Incentive Plan (except as provided above in this paragraph) and (iii) no holder of a Stock Option shall be permitted to exercise such Stock Option after the day that is two business days prior to the scheduled Closing Date. Garfield shall make such payments to the holders of such cancelled Stock Options on the Closing Date, immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Garfield Stock Incentive Plans_ " shall mean the 1991 Incentive Stock Option Plan, the 1994 Nonqualified Performance Option Plan, the 1996 Stock Option Plan, the 1999   ##### 

  

  

  

Stock Option Plan and the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. Garfield shall take all
actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing prior to the Effective Time.

To the extent not prohibited by Applicable Laws, each party to this Agreement shall use all reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Applicable Laws in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

resist any such action or proceeding, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts consummation of the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by vigorously
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all
available legislative action, unless, by mutual agreement, Panther
and Garfield decide that litigation is not in their respective best
interests. Garfield agrees and acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 5.1, in connection with any filing or submission

commit to take any action that would limit Garfields or Panthers freedom
of action with respect to, or their ability to retain any of, their
businesses, product lines or assets; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
relieve any party of its obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of
this Section 5.1(a) or in Section 5.1(b) shall in no event be construed to (i)
require either Garfield or Panther to undertake any efforts, or to take or
consent to any action if such efforts, action or consent would reasonably be
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect in relation to the continuing
operation of Garfield, or (ii) limit the right of a party to this Agreement
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, so long as such party to
this Agreement has up to then complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 5.1(a). 

   

 (b) _Reasonable Efforts_. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties to this Agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all other necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all other necessary registrations and filings (including other filings with Governmental Authorities, if any); (ii) the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties related to or required in connection with the Merger that are necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or required to prevent a Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time; (iii) the preparation of the Proxy Statement; (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement and (v) the providing of all such information concerning such party, its subsidiaries, its affiliates and its subsidiaries and affiliates officers, directors, employees and partners as may be reasonably requested in connection with any of the matters set forth in Section 5.1(a) above or this Section 5.1(b). 

   

 (c) _Public Announcements_. The initial press release concerning the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press release mutually agreed upon by Panther and Garfield.

    ##### 

  

    

Section 7.1, each of Panther and Garfield shall use its reasonable best
efforts to consult with each other before issuing any press release or other
public statement with respect to the Merger or the financial results or

been previously disclosed) and shall not issue any such press release prior to
such consultation; _provided_ , _however_ , that Panther and Garfield may
make any public statement in response to specific questions by the press,
analysts, investors and others so long as such statements disclose only that
information which has been disclosed in previous press releases or public
disclosures permitted by this Agreement. 

   

 (d) _Obligations of Panther s and of Garfields Subsidiaries_. Whenever this Agreement requires any of Panthers subsidiaries (including Subcorp) to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Panther to cause its subsidiaries to take such action.

 (ii) From and after the Effective Time, Panther shall treat all service by Garfield Employees with Garfield and its subsidiaries and their respective predecessors (to the extent recognized by the applicable Plan) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of the employee benefit plans of Panther and its subsidiaries as service with Panther or its subsidiaries (except for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans or to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative accrual on or after the Closing Date of benefits for the same period of service or to the extent such service is prior to a specific date before which service would not have

been credited for employees of Panther), and, with respect to any medical or
dental benefit plan in which Garfield Employees participate after the
Effective Time, Panther shall waive or cause to be waived any preexisting
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements ( _provided_ , 
_however_ , that no such waiver shall apply to a preexisting condition of any
Garfield Employee who was, as of the Effective Time, excluded from
participation in a Plan by virtue of such preexisting condition), and shall
provide that any covered expenses incurred on or before the Effective
Time during the plan year of the applicable Plan in which the Effective Time
occurs by a Garfield Employee or a Garfield Employees covered dependent
shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Effective Time to
the same extent as such expenses are taken into account for the benefit
of similarly situated employees of Panther and subsidiaries of Panther. 

   

 (iii) For purposes of this Section 5.2(b), " _Garfield Employees_ " means individuals who are, as of the Effective Time, employees of Garfield or any of its subsidiaries that are not subject to collective bargaining agreements for as long as they remain employees of Panther and its subsidiaries.

 (v) From and after the Effective Time, Panther shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and honor all Plans (other than any Garfield Stock Incentive Plan or other similar equity-based Plan); _provided_ , _however_ , nothing in this Agreement shall restrict Panthers or the Surviving Corporations ability to amend or terminate such Plans in accordance with their terms 

  

 (c) _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

   

 (i) Panther shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws, cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all Garfields obligations to indemnify the current or former directors or officers of Garfield for acts or omissions by such directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such obligations of Garfield exist on the date of this Agreement, whether pursuant to the Garfield Articles, the Garfield By-laws or individual indemnity agreements as in effect as of the date hereof, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the Garfield Articles, the Garfield By-laws and such individual indemnity agreements as in effect as of the date hereof from the Effective Time until six years following the Effective Time. Panther shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws, cause the Surviving Corporation to advance funds for expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding relating to the indemnification obligations referenced in the immediately preceding sentence in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall be ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to the indemnification referenced in the immediately preceding sentence. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Panther shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Garfield (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 250% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by Garfield for such insurance (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "); _provided further, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation may satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.2(c)(ii) by purchasing a "tail" policy under Garfields existing directors and officers insurance policy which (x) has an effective term of six years from the Effective Time, (y) covers those persons who are currently covered by Garfields directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (z) contains terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the insured than those of Garfields directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof. If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Panther shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Garfield represents to Panther that the Maximum Premium is $475,160. 

  

 (iii) In the event Panther, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Panther or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.2.

However, the Board of Directors of Garfield shall be permitted to (i) not recommend to Garfield Shareholders that they give the Garfield Shareholders Approval, or (ii) withdraw, modify or change the Garfield Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Panther (a " _Garfield Change in Recommendation_ "), and, in such event, not solicit votes in favor of such approval, if the Board of Directors of Garfield has concluded in good faith, based upon the advice of outside legal counsel, that the failure to so withhold, withdraw or modify its recommendation would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of, or be inconsistent with, its fiduciary obligations to Garfields shareholders under Applicable Laws; _provided_ that Garfield shall send Panther written notice of its intention to effect a Garfield Change in Recommendation at least three (3) business days prior to effecting a Garfield Change in Recommendation. Notwithstanding any such Garfield Change in Recommendation, Panther shall have the option, following such Garfield Change in Recommendation, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d). Garfield shall ensure that the Garfield Shareholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by it in connection with the Garfield Shareholders Meeting are solicited, in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws.

Proposal, except to notify such person as to the existence of the provisions

Proposal, or (v) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or
any agreement providing for any Alternative Proposal (except for
confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 5.3(d)(ii)). 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 5.3(d)(i), prior to the Garfield Shareholders Approval, if Garfield receives an Alternative Proposal which (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) which the Board of Directors of Garfield determines in good faith is reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal, Garfield may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Alternative Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, Garfield receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar, with respect to confidentiality ( _provided_ , that if any confidentiality agreement with such third party does not contain standstill provisions or contains standstill provisions more favorable to such third party than those contained in the confidentiality agreements between Panther and Garfield, dated January 6, 2006 and January 20, 2006 (together, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), then Garfield shall execute and deliver to Panther a waiver of the standstill provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement such that Panther will not be subject to greater standstill restrictions in any respect than the third party making such Alternative Proposal), to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to the Alternative Proposal. Upon receipt by Garfield after the date hereof of any Alternative Proposal or any request for nonpublic information which it reasonably believes would lead to an Alternative Proposal, Garfield shall provide Panther with oral and written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal, or of such request or inquiry and shall provide Panther with such reasonable information as is reasonably necessary to keep Panther reasonably informed with respect to any material current developments regarding any such Alternative Proposal, or regarding any such request or inquiry. 

  

 (iii) In response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn, the Board of Directors of Garfield may, at any time prior to the receipt of Garfield Shareholder Approval, effect a Garfield Change in Recommendation if the Board of Directors of Garfield has concluded in good faith, after consultation with Garfields outside legal and financial advisors, that the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Garfield Change in Recommendation would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of, or be inconsistent with, the directors fiduciary obligations to Garfields shareholders under Applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that Garfield shall send Panther written notice of its intention to effect a Garfield Change in Recommendation at least three (3) business days prior to effecting a Garfield Change in Recommendation. 

  

 (iv) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Garfield or its Board of Directors from disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any other disclosures required by Applicable Laws, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not relieve Garfield and its Board of Directors from complying with this Section 5.3(d) and Section 5.3(a). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (v) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide proposal or offer made by any person (other than a proposal or offer by Panther or any of its subsidiaries) for (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving Garfield, (ii) the acquisition by any person of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the assets of Garfield and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) the acquisition by any person of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the outstanding shares of any class of capital stock of Garfield or fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting power represented by the outstanding voting securities of Garfield. 

  

 (vi) As used in this Agreement " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean an unsolicited bona fide written offer made by a third party to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of Garfield and its subsidiaries as a whole or at least a majority of the total outstanding voting securities of Garfield on terms that the Board of Directors of Garfield determines in good faith, after consultation with Garfields financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as Garfields Board of Directors considers to be appropriate (including the timing, ability to finance and likelihood of consummation of such proposal), are more favorable to Garfield and its shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement _provided_ that the Board of Directors of Garfield shall not so determine that any such proposal is a Superior Proposal prior to the time that is 48 hours after the time at which Garfield has complied in all material respects with the last sentence of Section 5.3(d)(ii) with respect to such proposal. 

  

 (e) _Access_. Subject to legal restrictions resulting from Antitrust Laws, upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement, Garfield shall permit representatives of Panther to have reasonable access during normal business hours to Garfields premises, properties, books, records, contracts and documents; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access shall not unduly disrupt or unreasonably interfere with the conduct of business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Panther and its representatives shall not have access to personnel records of Garfield and its subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information the disclosure of which would subject Garfield or any of its subsidiaries to a risk of liability. Panther will keep the information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.3(e) confidential pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and shall cause its directors, officers and employees and representatives or advisors who receive any portion thereof to keep all such information confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation conducted pursuant to this Section 5.3(e) shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made in this Agreement. 

   

 (f) _Subsequent Financial Statements_. Prior to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Garfield shall consult with Panther prior to making publicly available its financial results for any period after the date of this Agreement and prior to filing any Garfield SEC Documents after the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (g) _Advice of Changes_. Prior to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Garfield shall promptly advise Panther orally and in writing of any event, change, effect, development, condition or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (h) _Consultation_. In connection with the continuing operation of the business of Garfield and its subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement, Garfield shall use reasonable efforts to consult in good faith on a regular basis with the representatives of Panther to report material operational developments and the general status of ongoing operations pursuant to procedures reasonably requested in writing by Panther or its representatives; _provided_ that the consultation required by this Section 5.3(h) shall be conducted in a manner so as not to disrupt in any material respect the business of Garfield. Garfield acknowledges that any such consultation shall not constitute a waiver by Panther of any rights it may have under this Agreement and that Panther shall not have any liability or responsibility for any actions of Garfield any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers with respect to matters that are the subject of such consultations. 

   

 (i) _Other Third Party Consents, Waivers or Approvals_. From and after the date hereof, Garfield shall use its best efforts, at the direction of Panther, to obtain the consents, waivers or approvals described in Section 5.3(i) of the Garfield Disclosure Schedule.

It is understood that in no event shall Garfield be required to pay the amount of Costs referred to in this Section 7.2 on more than one occasion. 

   

 7.3. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this Agreement, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of this Agreement by Garfield Shareholders, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made that by law requires further approval or authorization by Garfield Shareholders without such further approval or authorization.
