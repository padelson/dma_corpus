Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions from Panther, deliver the cash to be
paid to the shareholders of Garfield pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(b) out of the Exchange Fund and,
except as otherwise provided in Section&nbsp;2.2(d), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <I>Exchange Procedures</I>. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Panther
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(b): (i)&nbsp;a
letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the product of the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Garfield Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Garfield Common Stock represented by any Certificate which is not
registered in the transfer records of Garfield, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
Garfield Common Stock may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other
non-income taxes required by reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Panther that any
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Panther or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Garfield Common Stock such amounts as Panther or the Exchange Agent is required to
withhold or deduct under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), or any
provision of state, local or foreign law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Panther or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
remitted in a timely manner to the appropriate taxing authorities and shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Garfield Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Panther or the Exchange Agent.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration into which the Garfield Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate has
been converted. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;II.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <I>Closing of Transfer Books</I>. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Garfield
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Garfield Common Stock, which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this Article&nbsp;II, except as otherwise provided by law.

may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

Option</U>&#148;) outstanding at the end of the day immediately before the Closing Date, whether or not
vested or exercisable, shall, on the Closing Date prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled and the
holder of such Stock Option shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of such
cancelled Stock Option, an amount in cash, less any applicable Tax withholding, equal to the
product of (i)&nbsp;the number of shares of Garfield Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such
Stock Option (the &#147;<U>Option Shares</U>&#148;) multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;the amount, if any, by which the
Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such Stock Option. Garfield will
ensure that (i)&nbsp;the Garfield Stock Incentive Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and all
awards issued under such plans shall be terminated and the provisions in any other plan, program,
arrangement or agreement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of
the equity interests of Garfield or any of its subsidiaries shall be of no further force or effect
and shall be deemed to be terminated as of the Effective Time, (ii)&nbsp;no holder of a Stock Option or
any participant in any Garfield Stock Incentive Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any
securities of Garfield, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof or to receive any
payment or benefit with respect to any award under a Garfield Stock Incentive Plan (except as
provided above in this paragraph) and (iii)&nbsp;no holder of a Stock Option shall be permitted to
exercise such Stock Option after the day that is two business days prior to the scheduled Closing
Date. Garfield shall make such payments to the holders of such cancelled Stock Options on the
Closing Date, immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement,

however</I>, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation may satisfy its obligations

Approval, or (ii)&nbsp;withdraw, modify or change the Garfield Board Recommendation in a manner adverse
to Panther (a &#147;<U>Garfield Change in Recommendation</U>&#148;), and, in such event, not solicit votes
in favor of such approval, if the Board of Directors of Garfield has concluded in good faith, based

recommendation would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of, or be inconsistent with, its
fiduciary obligations to Garfield&#146;s shareholders under Applicable Laws; <I>provided </I>that Garfield

held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by it in connection with the Garfield
Shareholders Meeting are solicited, in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable
Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i)&nbsp;Garfield agrees that its obligation to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Garfield Shareholders Meeting, as required by this
Section&nbsp;5.3, shall not be affected by the withdrawal, amendment or modification of the Garfield
