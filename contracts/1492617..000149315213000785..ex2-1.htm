7.02 _Non-Waiver_. No failure by a Party to insist upon strict compliance
with a term or provision of this Agreement, to exercise any right, or to seek
a remedy is a waiver of the right to insist upon such strict compliance, to
exercise that or any other right, or seek that or any other remedy at any
other time. This Agreement may not be modified by custom or practice in the
trade, by the actions of the Parties or in any other manner except in writing
signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.

  



  

7.03 _Headings_. The headings of the various Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are not part of the context of this Agreement, are merely labels to
assist in locating such articles and Sections, and shall be ignored in
construing this Agreement.

  



  

7.04 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which is an original, but all of which taken together
are one and the same Agreement.

  



  

7.05 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with
respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
discussions, negotiations, agreements and understandings (both written and

7.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed
in accordance with the laws of Nevada, without regard to its principles of
conflicts of law. The Parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction and venue
of any federal or state court in Las Vegas, Nevada over any dispute arising
out of this Agreement and agree that all claims related to any dispute related
to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in any such court. The
Parties irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection they may have to the venue of any dispute brought in any such court
or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of the dispute. The
Parties irrevocably consent to process being served upon them in any site,
action or proceeding before any such court by delivering as provided for
notices in Section 7.01 of this Agreement. All rights and remedies of each
Party under this Agreement are cumulative and are in addition to all other
rights and remedies available to the Party from time to time, whether under
this Agreement otherwise.

  



  

7.07 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement is binding upon, inures to
the benefit of and is enforceable by and against the Parties and their
respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under
this Agreement may be transferred or assigned by any of the Parties without
the prior written consent of the other Parties and any attempted assignment
in violation of this provision is void.

  



  

7.08 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, each party shall pay the expenses they may incur in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without
limitation the fees and expenses of legal counsel, accountants and financial
advisors.

  



  

7.09 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a
court or other government entity to be unenforceable, the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith to rewrite such provision so that it is enforceable
to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and the Parties shall
abide by the provisions as rewritten. If any provision of this Agreement
cannot be rewritten, the provision shall be severed from this Agreement, but
every other provision of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
