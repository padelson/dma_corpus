AGREEMENT

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

 _THE OFFER_

  

  

Section 1.1 _The Offer._

  

  

(a) Provided that this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with
_Article VIII_ , as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
but in no event more than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required to commence the Offer if the
Company is not prepared to file the Schedule 14D‑9 with the SEC on the same
day as, and substantially contemporaneously with, Merger Sub's filing of the
Offer Documents with the SEC.

  

  

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
including the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (as defined in
_Annex I_ ) and the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of the other
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "),
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), as promptly as
practicable after the Expiration Date (as it may be extended in accordance
with this _Section 1.1_ ), consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms
and accept for payment, and promptly thereafter pay for, all Shares validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

  

  

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, the
Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer
Condition other than the Minimum Condition, and (iii) make any other changes
in the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise provided by
this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company (which the
Company may withhold in its sole discretion), Merger Sub shall not (A)
decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares subject to the Offer; (D)
impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend,
modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions, (F) amend or modify the
Minimum Condition, or (G) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date in a
manner other than as required or permitted by this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub may waive the Minimum Condition only with the prior written consent
of the Company (which the Company may withhold in its sole discretion). The
Offer may not be terminated or withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_.

  

  

 

2  

  

(d) Unless extended pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) at the end
of the day on the date that is 20 Business Days (for this purpose calculated
in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date on
which the Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Offer
has been extended beyond the Initial Expiration Date pursuant to, and in
accordance with, this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been
so extended (such Initial Expiration Date, or such later date and time to
which the Offer has been extended pursuant to, and in accordance with, this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

  

  

(e) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer
from time to time as follows: (i) if on the applicable Expiration Date, any of
the Offer Conditions (including the Minimum Condition) have not been satisfied
or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement,
waived by Parent or Merger Sub, then Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for
successive periods of not more than ten Business Days each (as determined by
Merger Sub), or such other period as may be agreed by Parent and the Company,
to permit the satisfaction of such Offer Conditions; and (ii) Merger Sub shall
extend the Offer for the minimum period required by applicable Law,
interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or NASDAQ or its staff.
Nothing in this _Section 1.1(e)_ shall (A) require Merger Sub to, and without
the Company's prior written consent (which the Company may withhold in its
sole discretion) Merger Sub shall not be permitted to, extend the Offer beyond
the End Date or (B) be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any
manner the right of the Parties to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
terms of _Section 8.1_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall extend the Offer
in any manner other than pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions
of this _Section 1.1(e)_ without the prior written consent of the Company
(which the Company may withhold in its sole discretion).

  

  

(f) The Offer Price shall be adjusted proportionately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Shares), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Shares occurring on or after the date hereof and
at or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer
Price shall provide to the holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 1.1(f)_ shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

  

  

(g) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to any applicable Expiration Date unless this Agreement is validly terminated
in accordance with the terms hereof. If this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with the terms hereof, then Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, shall not
acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law,
all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

  

  

 

3  

  

(h) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger
Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and
including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that shall contain or
incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter
of transmittal and summary advertisement, if any, and any other ancillary
Offer documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer shall be made, and
(ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to
all holders of Shares. Parent and Merger Sub agree that they shall cause the
Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto (collectively,
the " _Offer Documents_ ") filed by either Parent or Merger Sub with the SEC
to comply, in all material respects, with the Exchange Act and other
applicable Law. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly
correct any information provided by it or any of its Representatives for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and shall supplement the
information contained in the Offer Documents to include any information that
shall become necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and Parent and
Merger Sub further shall use their best efforts to promptly cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and to
promptly be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish or
otherwise make available in writing to Parent and Merger Sub or Parent's legal
counsel all information concerning the Company and the Company's stockholders
that is required by applicable Law or is reasonably requested by Parent to be
included in the Offer Documents. The Company and its legal counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall incorporate into the Offer Documents any
reasonable comments received from the Company or its legal counsel, prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub agree to provide the
Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents or the Offer. The Company and its legal counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed responses to any
comments Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents, and Parent and Merger Sub shall
incorporate into such responses any reasonable comments received from the
Company or its legal counsel, prior to the furnishing of such responses to the
SEC. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its legal counsel
with reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussions or meetings with
the SEC or its staff.

  

  

(i) Parent shall cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis all of
the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated
to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Merger Sub to perform, on a
timely basis, all of Merger Sub's obligations under this Agreement.

of the Schedule TO, the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to all
holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable
Law, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to _Section 5.2_ , shall include the Company
Board Recommendation and shall contain (i) the notice of appraisal rights
required to be delivered by the Company under Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL,
(ii) the opinion of the financial advisor referred to in _Section 3.29_ and

disseminate the Schedule 14D-9, including such notice of appraisal rights, to
the Company's stockholders as of such record date. The Company agrees that it
shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply, in all material respects, with the
Exchange Act and other applicable Law. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall respond promptly to correct any information provided by it or
its Representatives for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that
such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
or as otherwise required by applicable Law and shall supplement the
information contained in the Schedule 14D-9 to include any information that
shall become necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company further
shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected or supplemented to promptly be
filed with the SEC and to promptly be disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger
Sub shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available in writing to the
Company or the Company's legal counsel all information concerning Parent and
Merger Sub that is required by applicable Law or may reasonably be requested
by the Company to be included in the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and its counsel
shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and
the Company shall incorporate into the Schedule 14D-9 or any such amendment,
any reasonable comments received from Parent or its legal counsel, prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent and its
counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments. The Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and its legal counsel shall
be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed
responses to any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, and the Company shall
incorporate into such responses any reasonable comments received from Parent
or its legal counsel, prior to the furnishing of such responses to the SEC.
The Company shall provide Parent and its legal counsel with reasonable
opportunity to participate in any discussions or meetings with the SEC or its
staff.

  

  

(c) In connection with the Offer promptly following the date hereof, the
Company shall, or shall cause its transfer agent to, furnish Parent with a
list of the Company's stockholders of record and non-objecting beneficial
holders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing
the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of
securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case,
accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date, and shall
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other
assistance as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request. Except for
such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub
shall, and Parent and Merger Sub shall exercise their respective best efforts
to cause their respective agents to, hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files and shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, (i) Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Company or destroy all copies of and any extracts or summaries from such
information then in Parent's or Merger's Sub's possession or control (other
than electronic copies retained as part of ordinary course computer back-up
processes), (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective best efforts
to cause their respective agents to deliver to the Company or destroy, all
copies of and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their
possession or control (other than electronic copies retained as part of
ordinary course computer back-up processes), and (iii) Parent shall promptly
certify in writing to the Company Parent's and Merger Sub's compliance with
clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence.

register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by Merger Sub
effective immediately after the Offer Acceptance Time.

  

  

Section 1.3 _Directors_. To the extent requested by Parent in writing, the
Company shall use its best efforts to cause each director of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time to execute and deliver a letter
effectuating such Person's resignation as a member of the Company Board to be
effective as of the Effective Time. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in
addition to, and shall not limit, any right Merger Sub or Parent, or any of
their respective affiliates, may have (with respect to the election of
directors or otherwise) under applicable Law as a holder or beneficial holder
of shares of the Company's capital stock.

Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the properties,

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in

applicable Law;

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be

Section 2.5 _Conversion of Shares._

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

  

  

(i) any Shares held by the Company shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  

  

(ii) any Shares irrevocably accepted for purchase in the Offer shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor;

  

  

(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to _Section
2.5(b)_ , each Share then issued and outstanding (other than any Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to
the Offer Price, without interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance
with _Section 2.9_ ; and

  

  

(iv) each share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of Merger Sub
then issued and outstanding shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, all Shares converted pursuant to _Section
2.5(a)(iii)_ shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any certificates
evidencing such Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration therefor.

  

  

Section 2.6 _Surrender of Certificates._

  

  

 

7  

  

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of
such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement. At the Closing,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent sufficient
funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Shares (the " _Payment Fund_ "). To the extent the Payment Fund diminishes for
any reason below the level required to make prompt payment of the amounts
described in the preceding sentence, Parent and Merger Sub shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the lost
portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments
required by this _Article II_ or affect the amount of Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Shares and following any losses Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent in the amount of any
such losses. Any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to such
funds shall be paid to Parent. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) pay all charges and expenses, including those of the
Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares and the payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares.

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive any
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(iii)_ (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
such letter of transmittal. Upon (A) surrender to the Paying Agent of
Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, or (B)
receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable
Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares,
as applicable, shall then be cancelled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on
the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If
the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing
Shares are registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be
a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

  

  

(c) At any time following the date that is 12 months after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds
made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
other similar Law) as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the applicable Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law. If any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered or transferred prior
to the date on which the applicable Merger Consideration in respect thereof
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
then any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

 

8  

  

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  

  

(e) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. At the
close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company with respect to Shares shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
Law. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
surrender or transfer, as applicable, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.6_.

  

  

(f) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the
making of an effective affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, which includes an agreement to
indemnify and defend and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent from and against any and all costs, claims, losses,
judgments, damages, counsel fees, expenses and liabilities whatsoever which
each may suffer, sustain or incur in connection with (i) the inaccuracy of any
statement or the breach of any representation or warranty set forth in such
affidavit, and (ii) any payment for or transfer, exchange or delivery of such
Certificate and such Person's inability to locate such Certificate, and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.9_ ) equal to the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate.

  

  

Section 2.7 _Appraisal Rights._

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares (other
than Shares cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.5(a)(i)_ and _Section
2.5(a)(ii)_ ), if any, as to which the holder thereof shall have (i) properly
demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with the provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") and (ii) not effectively withdrawn or lost
such holder's rights to appraisal (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), shall not
be converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 2.5_ , but instead at the Effective Time shall
become entitled only to payment of the fair value of such Shares determined in
accordance with Section 262 (it being understood and acknowledged that at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with
Section 262); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares under Section 262, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, without interest or duplication, the applicable Merger
Consideration.

  

  

 

9  

  

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any Shares, of any withdrawals of such demands
and of any other instruments received by the Company under Section 262, and
Parent shall have the opportunity to participate (at its own expense) in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to
settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

Section 2.8 _Treatment of Company Options; Restricted Shares; Stock Plans._

  

  

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each option or similar
right to purchase Shares (the " _Company Options_ "), granted under any stock
option plan of the Company, including the Cogentix Medical, Inc. 2015 Omnibus
Incentive Plan, the Uroplasty 2006 Amended Stock and Incentive Plan, as
amended, the Vision-Sciences, Inc. 2000 Plan, the Vision-Sciences, Inc. 2003
Director Option Plan, and the Vision-Sciences, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan,
as amended from time to time, or any other plan, agreement or arrangement
(collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether or not such Company
Options are then vested or exercisable, shall be, pursuant to the terms of the
relevant Company Stock Plan and the stock option agreements evidencing the
Company Options, as a result of the Merger, and without any action on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of the Company Option or any
other Person, cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent
and the Surviving Corporation, as soon as practicable (but in no event more
than five Business Days) following the Effective Time, an amount in cash
(subject to deduction for any Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with
_Section 2.9_ ) equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares subject
to such Company Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of Shares previously subject to such Company
Option. Any Company Options for which the exercise price per share of Shares
is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled
without consideration. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the
Company Board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all necessary and appropriate action, including under the
Company Stock Plans and the stock option agreements evidencing the Company
Options and, to the extent necessary, using commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain consent of the holders of the Company Options for which the exercise
price thereof is less than the Offer Price, to effectuate the actions
contemplated by this _Section 2.8(a)_.

  

  

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each of the
restricted Shares (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") awarded under the Company
Stock Plans, whether or not such Restricted Shares are then vested or
exercisable, shall be, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Company Stock
Plan and the restricted stock award agreements evidencing the Restricted
Shares, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of the Restricted Share or any
other Person, cancelled and converted (without duplication of the conversion
contemplated by _Section 2.5(a)(iii)_ ) into the right to receive from Parent
and the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable (but in no event more
than five Business Days) following the Effective Time, an amount in cash
(subject to deduction for any Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with
_Section 2.9_ ) equal to the Merger Consideration payable in connection with
such Restricted Shares. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the
Company Board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all necessary and appropriate action, including under the
Company Stock Plans and the restricted stock award agreements evidencing the
Restricted Shares, to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section
2.8(b)_.

  

  

 

10  

  

(c) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. After the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options,
Restricted Shares or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted
thereunder.

  

  

Section 2.9 _Withholding_. Each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause
the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts as are required to be withheld
or deducted with respect to such consideration under any applicable provisions
of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law (including the Code). To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  

  

Section 2.10 _Further Action_. The Parties shall take all necessary action to
cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable following the
Offer Acceptance Time without a meeting of the Company's stockholders, as
provided in Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, then the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in
the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 _WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

  

  

Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed or furnished with the
SEC since March 31, 2015 and publicly available prior to the date hereof
(without giving effect to any amendment to any such document filed on or after
the date hereof and excluding any forward looking disclosures set forth in any
"risk factors" section, any disclosures in any "forward looking statements"
section and any other disclosures included therein to the extent they are
similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature), or in the applicable
section of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other section of this Agreement to which the relevance of such
item is reasonably apparent or where specifically cross-referenced and that
nothing in the Company SEC Documents shall be deemed to be a qualification of
or modification to the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections
3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ or _3.28_ ), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub, as of the date hereof and as of the Expiration Date
(other than with respect to those representations and warranties that by their

made only as of such date), as set forth below:

  

  

 

11  

  

Section 3.1 _Qualification, Organization, etc_. Except as set forth on Section
3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, with

standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business, in all
material respects, as presently conducted. Except as set forth on Section 3.1
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and, with respect to jurisdictions
that recognize the concept of good standing, is in good standing as a foreign
corporation or other entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing
or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
filed with the SEC, prior to the date of this Agreement, a complete and
accurate copy of the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws as amended to
the date hereof. The Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws are in full
force and effect and the Company is not in violation of either the Company
Certificate or, in any material respects, the Company Bylaws.

  

  

Section 3.2 _Capitalization, Subsidiaries._

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 Shares
and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of
March 6, 2018 (the " _Company Capitalization Date_ "), (i) 60,905,666 Shares
were issued and outstanding, including 476,619 Restricted Shares, (ii)

All the outstanding Shares that have been issued, and all the Shares that may
be issued pursuant to any outstanding award under any Company Stock Plan will

and free of preemptive rights. _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a correct and complete list, as of the Company
Capitalization Date, of all outstanding Company Options and Restricted Shares,
including, in each case, the name of the Company Stock Plan under which such
Company Options or Restricted Shares were granted, the name of the holder, and
the exercise price of such Company Options.

  

  

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_ above or on _Sections 3.2a)_ or
_3.2b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule or, to the extent permitted by the
express terms of this Agreement, (i) as of the date of this Agreement, the
Company does not have any shares of capital stock issued or outstanding other
than the Shares that were outstanding on the Company Capitalization Date or
that have become outstanding after the Company Capitalization Date but were
reserved for issuance as set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_ above as of the Company

Section 3.3 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation;
Governmental Authorizations._

  

  

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by the Company Board or a
duly authorized committee thereof and except for the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the DSOS, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary are necessary to authorize the consummation
of the Transactions. At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution
of this Agreement, at which all directors of the Company were present and
voted in favor, the Company Board duly adopted resolutions (i) declaring that
this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, are fair to and in
the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the Company, (ii)
approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein and of the DGCL, in each case subject to _Section 5.2_ , (iii) assuming
the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.8_
, taking all actions necessary so that the restrictions on "business
combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply with respect
to or as a result of the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement, the Tender and
Support Agreements and the Transactions, and (iv) making the Board
Recommendation; and such board resolutions have not been rescinded, modified
or withdrawn in any way. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and

binding agreement of the Company, Enforceable against the Company.

warranty set forth in _Section 4.8_ , no party to this Agreement or the Tender
and Support Agreements is an "interested stockholder" of the Company as
defined in Section 203(c) of the DGCL. No provision of the Company Governing
Documents (i) requires a vote of the stockholders of the Company to approve
the Offer, this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions or (ii) prohibits the Company and Parent from completing the
Merger pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL. Immediately prior to the
Company's execution of this Agreement, the Shares are listed on a national
securities exchange or are held of record by more than 2,000 holders.

  

  

(c) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and,
except as set forth on _Section 3.3(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the provisions of
this Agreement by the Company will not, (i) result in any violation or breach
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, modification, cancellation
or acceleration of any material obligation under any Contract binding upon the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or result in
any violation of any provision of the Company Governing Documents or any of
the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary (iii) conflict with or
violate any Laws or Orders applicable to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, or (iv) result
in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary, other than, in the case of clauses (i) or (iv), as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

 

13  

  

(d) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and
the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof

or notification to, any Governmental Entity, other than (i) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the DSOS, (ii) compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act or any other
applicable U.S. state or federal or foreign securities Laws, (iii) filings
with the SEC as may be required by the Company in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions, (iv) such filings as may be required under the
rules and regulations of NASDAQ, and (v) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the HSR Act and (vi) where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits of or to make such filings,
registrations with or notifications to any Governmental Entity or any other
Person, individually or in the aggregate, would not be material to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or prevent or materially
delay, or reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay, the Offer or
the Merger or performance by the Company to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

statement of a material fact or omitted (or, with respect to Company SEC
Documents filed after the date hereof, will omit) to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of
the Company's Subsidiaries is required to file or furnish any forms, reports

normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described
therein, including the notes thereto) and was prepared in conformity with
United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except,

(c) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has established and maintains a
system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule

to provide reasonable assurances (i) regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and the Company Board, and (iii) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' assets. The
management of the Company has implemented and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports. The management of the Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of its system of internal control over financial reporting prior to
the date of this Agreement, to the Company's outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material respect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's
internal controls over financial reporting. The Company is in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. No current or former attorney representing the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has reported in writing evidence of a material violation of
securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents, to the current Company Board or any committee thereof or
to any current director or executive officer of the Company. For purposes of
this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness"

Board Auditing Standard 2, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and each
former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all

Company Subsidiary, all of which have been made available by the Company to

avoidance of doubt, does include liabilities arising from any failure to
perform under or comply with any applicable Law, action, judgment or
Contract).

statements or other Company SEC Documents.

Company Subsidiaries has received any information or notification from the FDA
or any other Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over the testing,

negotiations concerning any Company Competing Proposal, the material resolved

affiliates or Representatives, except as required by applicable Law. The
Company shall provide Parent with at least 24 hours' prior notice (or such
lesser period of prior notice provided to the members of the Company Board) of
any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably
expected to consider any Company Competing Proposal.

  

  

 

44  

  

(d) Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this _Section 5.2(d)_ ,
the Company Board shall not (i) approve, endorse, adopt or recommend or
propose publicly to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend any Company Competing
Proposal, (ii) other than in the case of a Company Competing Proposal in the
form of a tender or exchange offer, fail to affirm publicly the Company Board
Recommendation upon Parent's written request within five Business Days after
such request after a public announcement of a Company Competing Proposal,
(iii) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange
offer (other than the Offer or any other tender offer or exchange offer by
Parent or Merger Sub) for the Shares prior to the 11th Business Day after the
commencement of such tender or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act, (iv) fail to make the Company Board Recommendation, (v)
withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or otherwise propose publicly to
withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation, (vi) make any public statement with respect to
the Transactions materially inconsistent with the Company Board
Recommendation, or (vii) resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions
(any of the foregoing, a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.2(d)_ to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make a Company
Change of Recommendation in response to (i) a Company Intervening Event, if
and only if (A) the Company Board has determined in good faith that a Company
Intervening Event has occurred, (B) the Company first complies with _Section
5.2(e)_ and (C) following the expiration of the notice period (and any
extensions thereof) described in _Section 5.2(e)_ , the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to
result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board
under applicable Law or (ii) a Company Superior Proposal, if and only if, (X)
the Company first complies with _Section 5.2(e)_ , (Y) Parent does not make,
within the notice period (and any extensions thereof) described in _Section
5.2(e)_ , an offer that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisor,
to be at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Company
Superior Proposal and (Z) following the expiration of the notice period (and
any extensions thereof) described in _Section 5.2(e)_ , the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to
result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board
under applicable Law.

  

  

(e) Prior to the Company making a Company Change in Recommendation in response
to an Intervening Event, the Company shall provide Parent with four Business
Days' prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
therefor (including the material facts and circumstances related to the
applicable Company Intervening Event), and during such four Business Day
period, (i) the Company shall negotiate, and cause its Representatives to
negotiate, with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to inquire into the facts
underlying such Company Intervening Event and to determine whether to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would obviate the need
for the Company Board to make a Company Change of Recommendation and (ii) the
Company shall consider in good faith any proposal by Parent to amend the terms
and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation. Prior to the Company making a
Company Change in Recommendation in response to a Company Superior Proposal,
the Company shall provide Parent with four Business Days' prior written notice
(it being understood and agreed that each material amendment to the applicable
Company Superior Proposal, including any revision to price, shall require a
new notice and an additional two Business Day period and that there may be
multiple extensions of the notice period) advising Parent that the Company
Board intends to take such action and contemporaneously providing to Parent a
copy of the Company Superior Proposal, a copy of any proposed agreements for
such Company Superior Proposal (including any financing commitments related
thereto) (or, in each case, if not provided in writing to the Company or any
of its Representatives, a written summary of the terms thereof) and the
identity of the Person making the Company Superior Proposal, and during such
four Business Day period (or subsequent two Business Day period or periods),
(x) the Company shall negotiate, and cause its Representatives to negotiate,
with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent wishes
to negotiate) to enable Parent to determine whether to propose revisions to
the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement related to the Transactions
such that such Company Superior Proposal would no longer constitute a Company
Superior Proposal and (y) the Company shall consider in good faith any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any
other agreement related to the Transactions such that such Company Superior
Proposal would no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal.

  

  

 

45  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Actor
(ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board has
reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would reasonably be likely to
result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board
under applicable Delaware Law or if such disclosure is otherwise required by
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop,
look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be
a Company Change of Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation (i) in such disclosure or (ii)
within two Business Days after requested to do so by Parent following the
making of such disclosure and, _further_ _provided_ , that this _Section
5.2(f)_ shall not permit the Company Board to make a Company Change of
Recommendation except in compliance with _Section 5.2(d)_ and _Section
5.2(e)_.

  

  

(g) References in this _Section 5.2_ to the "Company Board" shall include, to
the extent applicable, a duly authorized committee thereof.

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

  

  

Section 6.1 _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events._

  

  

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the Company shall, and the Company shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parent's Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all
of the respective properties (subject to the terms of the Real Property
Leases), offices, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and, during such period, the Company and
Parent shall, and Company shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to,
furnish reasonably promptly to Parent and Parent's Representatives all
information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be required by this _Section 6.1_ to provide Parent and
Parent's Representatives with access to or to disclose information (A) that
such Party or its Representatives is prohibited from providing under the terms
of a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the
ordinary course of business and not otherwise in breach of this Agreement (
_provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent not prohibited from doing so
under the terms of such confidentiality agreement, the Company shall promptly
provide Parent and its Representatives with a summary describing the general
nature of the information withheld and shall thereafter use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure), (B) the disclosure of which would violate any applicable Law or
legal duty ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law from doing so, the Company shall promptly provide Parent and
its Representatives with a summary describing the general nature of the
information withheld and shall thereafter use reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in
violation of any such Law or duty) or (C) that is subject to any attorney-
client, attorney work product or other legal privilege (provided, however,
that the Parent and Parent's Representatives shall use reasonable best efforts
to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not
result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other
legal privilege). Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to minimize any
disruption to the businesses of the Company that may result from the requests
for access, data and information hereunder.

  

  

 

46  

  

(b) Parent shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives and affiliates to
hold, any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant
to this _Section 6.1_ , in confidence to the extent required by and in
accordance with, and shall otherwise comply with, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or other Transactions, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, (ii) of any Legal
Proceeding commenced or, to any Party's knowledge, threatened against, such
Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise relating to,
involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, in
each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or other Transactions, (iii) any notice or
other communication received by any Party from any Person requesting the
convening of a meeting of the stockholders of such Party and (iv) upon
becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or
circumstance relating to it or, in the case of the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or
which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede
the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.1(c)_ shall not cure any
breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter
prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to any Party. In addition, the Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the
Company or breach of any covenant or agreement by the Company contained in
this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would reasonably be
expected to cause the Minimum Condition or items (b)(i) or (ii) in _Annex I_
not to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company's failure to promptly provide such notice shall not, in and
of itself, constitute a Willful Breach.

  

  

Section 6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts_ _._

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and except as
otherwise expressly stated, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary under applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i)
preparing and filing, in consultation with the other Party and as promptly as
practicable, all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices,
petitions, filings, and other documents and (ii) using its reasonable best
efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations necessary to be obtained by such Party
from any third party or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the
Merger or any of the other Transactions.

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing provisions of
_Section 6.2(a)_ , each of the Parties, as applicable, shall prepare and file
as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event no later than five
Business Days from the date of this Agreement, (x) with the United States
Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice, a pre-
merger notification and report form and related material required for the
Transactions pursuant to the HSR Act, which forms shall specifically request
early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act, and (y) any
other filings (or drafts if required) and related materials required for the
Transactions pursuant to any Other Antitrust Laws. The Company and Parent
shall each instruct their respective counsel to cooperate with each other and
use their respective reasonable best efforts to facilitate and expedite the
identification and resolution of any issues under the HSR Act or any Other
Antitrust Law and, consequently, the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, or the equivalent under any Other
Antitrust Law, in each case, at the earliest practicable date.

  

  

 

47  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with the
receipt of any necessary approvals or clearances by Governmental Entities
(including under any applicable antitrust Law), nothing in this Agreement
shall require Parent or any of its affiliates to, nor shall the Company or any
of its affiliates, without the prior written consent of Parent, agree or
proffer to, divest, hold separate, or enter into any license or similar
agreement with respect to, or agree to restrict the ownership or operation of,
or agree to conduct or operate in a specified manner, any portion of the
business, rights, product lines, services or other operations or assets of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates (the foregoing,
collectively, the " _Divestiture Actions_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, in no event shall Parent or any of its affiliates be
obligated to litigate or participate in the litigation of any Legal
Proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental
Entity or appeal any Order (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, delay
materially or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or prohibit the Offer
or the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions or seeking to
obtain from Parent or any of its affiliates any damages in connection
therewith, or (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any respect, or place any
conditions on, the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of
their respective affiliates of all or any portion of the business, assets or
any product of the Company or any of its affiliates or Parent or any of its
affiliates or to require any such Person to dispose of, license (whether
pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or enter into a consent
decree or hold separate all or any portion of the business, assets or any
product of the Company or any of its affiliates or Parent or any of its
affiliates, in each case as a result of or in connection with the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions (the foregoing, collectively, the "
_Litigation Actions_ ").

  

  

Section 6.3 _Financing._

  

  

(a) Without limiting the generality Parent's obligations under _Section 6.2_ ,
(i) Parent shall obtain the Equity Financing on the terms and conditions
contained in the Letter Agreement, including by (A) maintaining in effect the
Letter Agreement until the consummation of the Transactions, (B) subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ ,
satisfying on a timely basis (or, if applicable, obtaining waivers of) all the
conditions to funding in the Letter Agreement, (C) complying on a timely basis
with all of the covenants and other obligations set forth in the Letter
Agreement, and (D) consummating the Equity Financing, subject to the terms and
conditions herein and in the Letter Agreement; and (ii) Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange any Debt Financing.

  

  

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Section 6.3(b)_ , and unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent,
the Company will, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub or the Debt
Financing Sources that is customary in connection with the Debt Financing,
including (i) providing any information set forth on _Section 6.3(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) subject to the remaining provisions of this
_Section 6.3(b)_ and _Section 6.3(c)_ , making appropriate officers available
for participation in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with any prospective lender
to Parent and rating agencies and cooperating with the marketing efforts of
the Parent and Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Sources, (iii) assisting with
the preparation of customary materials for rating agency presentations,
information memoranda, lender and investor presentations and similar documents
in connection with any Debt Financing, (iv) assisting in the preparation of,
and executing and delivering, any definitive financing documents, including
guarantee and collateral documents and other certificates, instruments and

chief financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters) or as
may be reasonably requested by Parent that are, in each case, effective only
upon the occurrence of the Closing, (v) facilitating the pledging of
collateral for any Debt Financing that is effective only upon the occurrence
of the Closing, (vi) taking all corporate, corporate and other equivalent
actions and providing such other assistance, reasonably necessary or
reasonably requested by Parent, that are, in each case, effective only upon
the occurrence of the Closing to permit the consummation of any Debt
Financing, (vii) obtaining other documentation and items customarily required
by any Debt Financing or as are reasonably requested by Parent, and (viii)
providing all documentation and other information about the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as is requested in writing by Parent in connection with

money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to deliver or
cause the delivery of any landlord waivers or estoppels, non-disturbance
agreements, surveys or title insurance. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
_Section 6.3(b)_ to the contrary, none of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries will be required to execute any definitive financing
documentation that is effective before the occurrence of the Closing, and no
obligation of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any such
document, agreement or pledge will be effective until the occurrence of the
Closing.

  

  

 

48  

  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement (including this _Section 6.3_ ) will require
cooperation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the extent it would
require the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
affiliates to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur
any liability or give any indemnities, in any such case prior to the
occurrence of the Closing. Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following written request by the Company (and in any event prior to the
Effective Time), reimburse the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all
reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented fees, costs and expenses of counsel, accountants engaged to assist
with any Debt Financing and other advisors) incurred by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries and their respective representatives in connection
their compliance with _Section 6.3(b)_ (the " _Reimbursement Obligations_ ")
and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its stockholders and the
Company Subsidiaries from and against all losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of any Debt Financing and any information used in connection
therewith, except with respect to any historical financial or other
information provided by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in
each case, other than to the extent any of the foregoing was suffered or
incurred as a result of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or, in each case, any of their
respective affiliates or Representatives.

  

  

(d) Nothing in this Agreement (including this _Section 6.3_ ) will require
cooperation of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to the extent it
would require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to take any
action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) under, the organizational documents of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, any major Contract, or any applicable Law, to waive or
amend any term in this Agreement, or to cause any representation or warranty
in this Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, (ii) unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business or
operations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (iii) prevent
the prompt and timely discharge in all material respects of the duties of any
of the officers (or Person occupying a similar position) of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, (iv) result in any officer or director (or Person
occupying a similar position) of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries incurring any personal liability with respect to any matters
relating to the Debt Financing, (v) require the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates to take any action that is
not contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, (vi) require providing
access to or disclose information that the Company is advised by legal counsel
would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of, or violate with
confidentiality requirements binding on, the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or (vii) require any such Person to change any fiscal period.

  

  

 

49  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) neither
the receipt of any information described in this _Section 6.3_ nor assistance
required under this _Section 6.3_ is a condition to Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations to effect the Closing and non-compliance or non-performance by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or breach by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries of their respective obligations under this _Section
6.3_ will not constitute a breach of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ as
it relates to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; and (ii) Parent
and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that in the event that the
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), Parent and Merger
Sub will be obliged to, and will (x) to the extent necessary to consummate the
Equity Financing and the Debt Financing and draw down the proceeds thereof in
order to allow Parent and Merger Sub to accept for payment, and promptly
thereafter pay for, all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)_ and consummate the Closing
in accordance with _Section 2.2_ , and will take, or cause to be take, any and
all actions necessary or desirable to cause the same to occur, and (y) accept
for payment, and promptly thereafter pay for, all Shares validly tendered and
not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)_ and
consummate the Closing in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

  

  

Section 6.4 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates or Representatives,
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless (a) such Party
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by
applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions, or (b) such
press release or other public announcement relates to a Company Competing
Proposal and is expressly permitted under _Section 5.2_ , in which event such
Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to
provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon
such press release or other announcement as far in advance as practicable and
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company may
make public statements in response to questions from the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences so long as such statements
are substantially consistent with press releases, public disclosures or public
statements previously issued or made by Parent or the Company, as applicable.

  

  

 

50  

   

Section 6.5 _Directors ' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification_. For not
less than six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all current and former
officers, directors and similar functionaries of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs
or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party agrees
in advance to return any such funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction
has determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is
not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts
or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer or
director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or of any Person
serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another Person, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law or provided pursuant to the Company Governing Documents or
the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any other agreement
set forth on _Section 6.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case,
as in existence on the date of this Agreement. The Parties agree that for six
years after the Effective Time all rights to elimination or limitation of
liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now
existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company
Governing Documents or the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary
or any agreement set forth on _Section 6.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an
aggregate period of not less than six years from the Effective Time, the
Company's current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time
(the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the Company's
existing policy as of the date of this Agreement or, if insurance coverage
that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage;
provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of
the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement or, if less,
the cost of a policy providing coverage on the same terms as the Company's
existing policy as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , further, that
the Company may prior to the Effective Time substitute therefor a single
premium tail coverage with respect to DandO Insurance with an annual cost not in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement. Following the Closing and until the sixth anniversary thereof,
Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries to, take any action adversely affecting, with retroactive effect
to periods prior to the Closing, the rights of the Indemnified Parties
relating to exculpation or indemnification (including with respect to
advancement of expenses) set forth in the Company Governing Documents or the
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary. The rights and obligations
under this _Section 6.5_ shall survive consummation of the Merger and shall
not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified
Party without the written consent of such Indemnified Party. The provisions of
this _Section 6.5_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her legal
representatives.

  

  

Section 6.6 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall (a) take all action
necessary so that no Takeover Statute or, in the case of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, any similar provision of the Company Governing Documents
or the organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries, is or becomes
applicable to the Merger, the Tender and Support Agreements or any of the
other Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute or, in the case of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, any similar provision of the Company
Governing Documents or the organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries, is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all
action necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover
Statute on the Merger and the other Transactions.

  

  

 

51  

   

Section 6.7 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its respective obligations under this
Agreement and to cause Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions, including
the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.8 _Employee Benefits Matters._

  

  

(a) Each employee who, after the Closing Date, continues to be actively
employed by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof
(the " _Continuing Employees_ "), will receive credit, under each employee
benefit plan sponsored by Parent under which such Continuing Employee is
eligible to participate, for periods of employment with the Company (including
any current or former affiliate of the Company or any predecessor of the
Company to the extent such service was recognized by the respective Company
Benefit Plan) for purposes of calculating such Continuing Employee's
eligibility and vesting service and, in addition, for purposes of calculating
benefit amounts under any severance or vacation plan; provided, prior service
credit will not be recognized to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

  

  

(b) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to fully terminate any 401(k) plans maintained by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company
401(k) Plans_ "), fully vest the accounts of all participants in such Company
401(k) Plans as required by Law and amend such Company 401(k) Plans to the
extent necessary to allow for a rollover distribution of a plan loan (as noted

Parent, Merger Sub, Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates) any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or

(or the employment of any other individual) at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this

or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit
Plan or employee benefit plan of the Parent, Merger Sub, Surviving Corporation
or any affiliate of Parent, (ii) create any third party rights in any current
or former service provider of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or
affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof), or (iii) alter or

and comment on such communications prior to distribution.

officers relating to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the Transactions.
Unless, in the case of any such Legal Proceeding with respect to the Company,
the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) has made a Company
Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.2, the Company shall permit
Parent to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made
by the Company in connection with any such Legal Proceeding (and the Company
shall in good faith take such comments into account), and otherwise afford
Parent the opportunity to participate (at Parent's expense) in the defense,
prosecution or settlement of any such Legal Proceeding, and the Company shall
not offer to settle, in full or in part, any such Legal Proceeding, nor shall
any such full or partial settlement be agreed to without Parent's prior
written consent. In the event of, and to the extent of, any conflict or
overlap between the provisions of this Section 6.9 and Section 5.1 or Section
6.2, the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall control.

  

  

Section 6.10 _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist the Shares from NASDAQ and terminate their registration under the

Company may approve, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3

the Transactions by each officer or director of the Company who is subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to equity securities of the
Company and any affiliate of a director of the Company that may rely on Rule
16b-3. In addition, the compensation committee or similar committee of the
Company Board shall adopt such resolutions and approvals as are necessary for
all employment, compensation, severance or other benefit arrangements with
directors, officers, or employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
made or undertaken in connection with the Transactions to be subject to the
safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.12 _Treatment of Company Indebtedness_. The Company shall, or shall
cause the applicable Company Subsidiaries to, arrange for a payoff letter and
instruments of discharge, in each case, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, providing for the payoff, discharge and termination in

necessary to avoid or eliminate such impediment under such requirement so as
to enable the Parties to close the Transactions or (C) at any time within 2

other than items (b)(v)(B), (b)(v)(C), (b)(vii) and (b)(viii), have been
satisfied;

  

  

(d) at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, by Parent, by written

notice thereof to Parent and Merger Sub delivered during the three Business
Days prior to the 180th day after the date hereof) or Parent (by written
notice to the Company delivered during the three Business Days prior to the
180th day after the date hereof) may extend the End Date to the 365th day
after the date hereof, if, at the time of such extension, any of the

_Annex I_ remains unsatisfied and all conditions set forth in _Annex I_ ,
other than items (b)(v)(B), (b)(v)(C), (b)(vii) and (b)(viii), have been

must confirm such fact);

  

  

(f) at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, by the Company, by written
notice to Parent, in order to accept a Company Superior Proposal and enter
into the Superior Proposal Acquisition Agreement relating to such Company
Superior Proposal if the Company Board, or a duly authorized committee
thereof, has authorized the Company, in compliance with the terms of this
Agreement (including _Section 5.2_ ), to make a Change in Company
Recommendation as a result of such Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in the event of such termination, the Company on the day
such termination occurs and substantially concurrently therewith enters into
the Superior Proposal Acquisition Agreement and pays the Company Termination
Fee as required by _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_ ;

(g) at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, by Parent, by written
notice to the Company, if a breach of any representation or warranty or
failure to perform any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on
the part of the Company has occurred that would cause a failure of the
conditions in _Annex I_ to be satisfied, including any breach or failure
causing an Effect that would cause a failure of the condition set forth in
item (b)(iv) of _Annex I_ to have occurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
purposes of this _Section 8.1(g)_ , if such a breach is curable by the Company
by the earlier of the End Date and 30 days following the date on which Parent
gives the Company notice of such breach, and the Company is continuing to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach, then Parent may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(g)_ on account of such breach
unless such breach remains uncured upon the earlier of the End Date and the
expiration of such 30-day period;

  

  

(h) at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, by the Company, by written
notice to Parent, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of
Parent has had a Parent Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, for purposes of this _Section 8.1(h)_ , if such a breach is curable by
Parent by the earlier of the End Date and 30 days following the date on which
the Company gives Parent notice of such breach, and Parent is continuing to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach, then the Company may
not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(h)_ on account of such
breach unless such breach remains uncured upon the earlier of the End Date and
the expiration of such 30-day period;

to Parent, if (i) the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ have been satisfied or
waived at the Expiration Date (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time, but subject to those
conditions being able to be satisfied) and (ii) Merger Sub shall have failed
to consummate (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer within five
Business Days following the Expiration Date; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in _Section 8.1(f)_ to the contrary, the Company
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_ during any such five Business Day period.

  

  

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination._

  

  

(a) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement as provided in
_Section 8.1_ , written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 8.2_ and
_Article IX_ shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability for (i) fraud or (ii) a
Willful Breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set

from such breach by a Party of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

(b) _Company Termination Fee_.

  

  

(i) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ (or

such amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by the Company.

Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for any Company Competing
Proposal with an aggregate value equal to or greater than $239,000,000, then
the Company shall, concurrently with the consummation of such Company
Competing Proposal, pay to Parent an amount equal to the Parent Termination
Fee (less the reasonable fees and expenses of the Company actually incurred
and documented in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and in
furtherance of the consummation of the Transactions).

  

  

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

  

 

57  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that the Company Termination Fee is paid to Parent in circumstances for which
such fee is payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ , other than with respect to
claims for, or arising out of or in connection with, fraud or Willful Breach
of this Agreement, payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of Parent, its stockholders and their respective Representatives
against the Company and its Representatives for any loss suffered as a result
of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount,
none of the Company or its Representatives or affiliates shall have any
further liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger
or the other Transactions except as specified above. Any Company Termination
Fee paid by the Company to Parent shall be offset against any damages awarded
to Parent pursuant to any claim based on fraud or Willful Breach of this
Agreement.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (on behalf of themselves and their
affiliates, equityholders, directors, officers, employees, agents and
Representatives) hereby (i) waives any rights or claims it or they may have
against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, any Debt
Financing or in respect of any other document or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any theory of law or equity (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, (ii) agrees not to commence any action or proceeding against any
Debt Financing Source or Debt Financing Affiliate in connection with this
Agreement, any Debt Financing or in respect of any other document or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any theory of law or equity
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) and (iii) agrees to cause any such
action or proceeding asserted by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (on behalf of themselves and their affiliates, equityholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents and Representatives) in connection with
this Agreement, any Debt Financing or in respect of any other document or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any theory of law or
equity (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) against any Debt Financing
Source or Debt Financing Affiliate to be dismissed or terminated. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged
and agreed that no Debt Financing Source or Debt Financing Affiliate shall
have any liability for claims or damages to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement, any Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The provisions of this paragraph
shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, each Debt Financing
Source, Debt Financing Affiliate and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, each of which is hereby intended to be an express third party
beneficiary of this _Section 8.2(e)_.

  

  

(f) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that neither the
Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but
rather is a reasonable amount that shall compensate Parent and Merger Sub (in
the case of the former) and the Company (in the case of the latter) in the
circumstances in which such payment is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

Exchange Act. The table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement
are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect or be
deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or
any term or provision hereof. Any definition of or reference to any Contract
herein shall be construed as referring to such Contract as from time to time
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified (except for any Contracts required
to be included on the Company Disclosure Schedule). When reference is made
herein to a Person, such reference shall be deemed to include all direct and
indirect Subsidiaries, successors and assigns of such Person unless otherwise
indicated or the context otherwise requires. All references herein to the
Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context
otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any Law, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be construed against
the party drafting such agreement or document. Prior drafts of this Agreement
and the documents referred to herein or the fact that any clauses have been
added, deleted or otherwise modified from any prior drafts of this Agreement
or the documents referred to herein shall be deemed to not to provide any
evidence as to the meaning of any provision hereof or the intent of the
Parties with respect hereto, it being understood that none of the foregoing
shall result in any presumption or burden of proof either favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of such prior drafts. The words "hereof,"
"herein," "hereinafter" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used

particular provision of this Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise.

Parent's Representatives for their review by posting to the electronic data
room hosted by IntraLinks no later than the day prior to the execution of this
Agreement. The listing of any matter on the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company to any Person not a
Party, or to otherwise imply to any Person not a Party, that any such matter
is material, is required to be disclosed by the Company under this Agreement
or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth
in this Agreement. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule relating
to any possible breach or violation by the Company of any Contract or Law
shall be construed as an admission or indication to any Person not a Party
that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. In no event
shall the listing of any matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule be deemed
or interpreted to expand the scope of the Company's representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement. Unless expressly provided
otherwise, the measure of a period of one month or year for purposes of this
Agreement shall be the date of the following month or year corresponding to
the starting date; provided, that if no corresponding date exists, then the

month or year following that month or year in which no corresponding date
exists (for example, one month following February 18 is March 18, and one
month following March 31 is May 1). With respect to the determination of any
period of time, the words "from" and "since" mean "from and including" and
"since and including," respectively, and the words "to" and "until" each mean
"to and including." In interpreting and enforcing this Agreement, each
representation and warranty will be given independent significant of fact and
will not be deemed superseded or modified by any other representation or
warranty. If any Party has breached or violated, or if there is an inaccuracy
in, any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect,
the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant
relating to the same or similar subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) which the Party has not breached or violated, or in
respect of which there is not an inaccuracy, will not detract from or mitigate
the fact that the Party has breached or violated, or that there is an
inaccuracy in, the first representation, warranty or covenant.

Section 9.8 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries._

  

  

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule), the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Tender and Support Agreements, the Restrictive
Covenant Agreements and the Letter Agreement constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all other prior agreements (except that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be deemed amended hereby so that until the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ hereof, Parent and Merger Sub shall
be permitted to take the actions contemplated by this Agreement) and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or any of them with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

  

 

73  

  

(b) Except as provided in this _Section 9.8(b)_ and _Section 6.5_ (with
respect to the Indemnified Parties) and this _Section 9.8(b)_ and _Sections
9.1_ , _9.10_ and _9.11_ (with respect to the Debt Financing Sources), neither
this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule) nor the
Confidentiality Agreement are intended to confer upon any Person other than
the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Indemnified Parties shall have the right
to enforce the provisions of this _Section 9.8(b)_ and _Section 6.5_ , (ii)
the Debt Financing Sources shall have the right to enforce the provisions of
this _Section 9.8(b)_ and _8.2e)_ , _9.1_ , _9.10_ and _9.11_ , and (iii) the
Debt Financing Affiliates shall have the right to enforce the provisions of
_Section 8.2(e)_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the
Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the Parties in accordance with _Section 9.1_ without notice or
liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  

  

Section 9.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions
are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

  

Section 9.10 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement, and any Legal
Proceeding arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement,

applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any Legal Proceeding
between any of the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the Transactions each of the Parties (a) irrevocably and unconditionally

Division) or, if (and only if) the Superior Court of the State of Delaware
(Complex Commercial Division) declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, and any

now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action, dispute or controversy
in any such court or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient
court and agrees not to plead or claim the same, (c) agrees that it shall not
bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in
any court other than the aforesaid courts, and (d) irrevocably consents to
service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested,
postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in
accordance with _Section 9.4_ , in addition to any other method to serve
process permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties agrees that (i) it will not
bring or support any Legal Proceedings against the Debt Financing Sources
arising out of or related to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to any Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in
any forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction located within the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, whether a state or federal court

FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,

rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) Parent and one
or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or (iii) one
or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such assignment shall be permitted without the prior
written consent of the other Parties if such assignment could increase the
risk that any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ may not be timely
satisfied, result in a breach of any of covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement or adversely affect the Company; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any
liability under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without
relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

  

  

Section 9.13 _Enforcement; Remedies._

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party shall be deemed cumulative with and not

Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

  

  

(b) Each Party to this Agreement agrees that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by another Party of any covenant, obligation or other
provision set forth in this Agreement (i) the non-breaching Party shall be
entitled, without any proof of actual damages (and in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it) to (A) a decree or order of specific
performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant, obligation or other provision, and (B) an injunction restraining

Letter Agreement or otherwise, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall
not be entitled to specific performance of, or other equitable remedies in
connection with enforcing, Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded (or to cause directly such Equity Financing to
be Funded under the Letter Agreement) and to cause the Offer Acceptance Time
to occur and to effect the Closing (but not the right of the Company to seek
such specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason)
unless (i) all conditions in _Annex I_ were satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance
Time, but subject to those conditions being able to be satisfied) or waived on
the Expiration Date), (ii) Parent fails to complete the Closing by the date
the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_ , and (iii)

consummate the Closing and stands ready, willing and able to consummate the

Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.13_ (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the avoidance of
doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a
breach of this Agreement by any Party.

as of the Expiration Date as if made on and as of such Expiration Date, except
that any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties shall be
disregarded if the circumstances giving rise to all such inaccuracies

Re: Letter Agreement

  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

  

Laborie Medical Technologies Canada ULC, an unlimited liability company
incorporated under the laws of British Columbia (" _Investor_ "), is pleased
to offer this (i) commitment, subject to the terms and conditions contained
herein, in connection with that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
of March [•], 2018 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time in
accordance with its terms, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Cogentix
Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), LM US Parent, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Camden Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "),
pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, and (ii) guarantee of the payment obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions
therein. This letter agreement is being delivered by Investor to Parent and
Merger Sub solely in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement,
and to induce the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement. Capitalized
terms used but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Merger Agreement. All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful
money of the United States, in immediately available funds.

  

  

1. _Commitment_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this letter agreement (including _Section 2_ ), Investor hereby agrees to contribute, or cause to be contributed as an equity contribution to Parent or Merger Sub, a maximum aggregate amount of cash up to the aggregate amount of all consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement, plus Parent Expenses (as defined below) plus all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Company in connection with enforcement hereunder by the Company, if applicable (together, the " _Commitment_ ") solely for purposes of funding:

  

  

(a) the payment (i) at the Offer Acceptance Time of the aggregate amount
payable to holders of Shares validly tendered, and not validly withdrawn,
pursuant to the Offer, (ii) at the Closing of the aggregate amount of all
Merger Consideration, pursuant to Article II of the Merger Agreement (the
amounts described in clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Transaction Consideration_
") and (iii) the payment of all fees, expenses and other amounts payable by
Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement (such amounts in this clause (iii), " _Parent Expenses_ ");

  

    

   

(b) the payment of damages arising out of, caused by or resulting from a
Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their respective obligations under
the Merger Agreement, in the aggregate, up to an amount equal to an amount
equal to the aggregate of the consideration payable pursuant to the Merger
Agreement (as described in subsections (a) and (b) above) were the Offer
Acceptance Time and the Closing to have occurred, plus any reasonable fees and
expenses of the Company actually incurred and documented in connection with
the enforcement of an award of such damages (the " _Willful Breach Cap Amount_
"); and

  

  

(c) the Parent Termination Fee (if applicable) required to be paid by Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement
pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 8.2(c) of the Merger Agreement.

  

  

As used herein, " _Final Order_ " shall mean (i) a final and binding award or
decision of an arbitral tribunal, with respect to claims submitted to
arbitration, (ii) with respect to a party's application for emergency or
interim relief, including specific performance under _Section 2_ of this
letter agreement and/or _Section 3_ of this letter agreement, submitted to a
court of competent jurisdiction, a final order or judgment of such court, or
(iii) a written agreement between the Company, on the one hand, and Parent,
Merger Sub or Investor, on the other hand, that amounts are due and owing by
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and/or Investor, as applicable. Investor
reserves the right to fulfill its obligations pursuant to this letter
agreement by contributing share capital, share premium reserve and/or
subordinated shareholder loans to the Parent or Merger Sub or by any other
means, so long as the Parent or Merger Sub receives the amount of the
Commitment in cash solely for the uses expressly contemplated by this _Section
1_.

  

  

2. _Conditions_. Investor's obligation to fund, or cause to be funded, the Commitment pursuant to this letter agreement is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions, as applicable:

  

  

(a) With respect to _Section 1(a)_ above, either (i) the satisfaction, or
express written waiver by Parent and Merger Sub, at Closing, of all conditions
precedent to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to accept for payment,
and pay for, those Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer, and not
validly withdrawn, set forth in Annex I to the Merger Agreement, or (ii) a
Final Order shall have been obtained awarding specific performance or other
equitable remedy to specifically enforce Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations
to accept for payment, and pay for, those Shares validly tendered pursuant to
the Offer, and not validly withdrawn, or to consummate the Closing on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (the " _Closing
Specific Performance Remedy_ "); _provided_ that (1) Investor and/or its
permitted assignees will not have any obligation under any circumstances to
contribute to, purchase equity or debt securities of or otherwise provide
funds to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 1(a)_ above in any amount
in excess of the Commitment, (2) the equity contributed by Investor and/or its
permitted assignees to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this _Section 2(a)_
may only be used by Parent or Merger Sub to satisfy the obligations described
in _Section 1(a)_ , and not for any other purpose and (3) funding of the
Commitment with respect to _Section 1(a)_ above will occur substantially
contemporaneously with the Offer Acceptance Time. In the event that the
Transaction Consideration is reduced in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement and therefore Parent and Merger Sub do not require Investor
to fund all of the equity financing with respect to which Investor has made
its Commitment in order to consummate the Transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, then the amount required to be funded by Investor under this
letter agreement pursuant to _Section 1(a)_ will be correspondingly reduced.
In the event that Parent and Merger Sub do not require the total aggregate
amount of the Commitment in order to consummate the Transactions, the amount
to be funded under this letter agreement will be reduced, without limitation,
by the amount (if any) of the debt financing proceeds funded at the Closing to
fund a portion of the Transaction Consideration and to pay related expenses
and other amounts payable by Parent or Merger Sub at the Closing.

  

  

 

2  

  

(b) With respect to _Section 1(b)_ above, a Final Order shall be obtained
awarding the Company damages arising out of, caused by or resulting from a
Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations under the Merger
Agreement, in each case, in the aggregate, up to the Willful Breach Cap Amount
and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement; _provided_
that (i) Investor and/or its permitted assignees will not have any obligation
under any circumstances to contribute to, purchase equity or debt securities
of or otherwise provide funds to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to _Section
1(b)_ above in any amount in excess of the Willful Breach Cap Amount, (ii) the
equity contributed by Investor and/or its permitted assignees to Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to this _Section 2(b)_ may only be used by Parent or
Merger Sub to satisfy the obligations described in _Section 1(b)_ , and not
for any other purpose and (iii) funding of the amount payable for damages
arising out of, caused by or resulting from a Willful Breach pursuant to
_Section 1(b)_ above, which such amount shall not exceed the Willful Breach
Cap Amount, will occur within two Business Days of receipt of such Final
Order.

  

  

(c) With respect to _Section 1(c)_ above, the valid termination of the Merger
Agreement by Parent or the Company pursuant to and in accordance with Section
8.1(c) of the Merger Agreement; _provided_ that (1) Investor and/or its
permitted assignees will not have any obligation under any circumstances to
contribute to, purchase equity or debt securities of or otherwise provide
funds to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 1(c)_ above in any amount
in excess of the Parent Termination Fee, and (2) the equity contributed by
Investor and/or its permitted assignees to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
this _Section 2(c)_ may only be used by Parent or Merger Sub to satisfy the
obligations described in _Section 1(c)_ , and not for any other purpose and
(3) the funding of the Parent Termination Fee with respect to _Section 1(c)_
above will occur on the day the Merger Agreement termination occurs and
substantially contemporaneously with such termination.

3. _Enforcement/Recourse_. The Company is hereby made a third party beneficiary of the rights granted to Parent hereby and shall be entitled to seek an injunction, an order for specific performance or any other non-monetary equitable remedy to cause the Commitment (or a portion thereof, as applicable in accordance with this letter agreement) to be funded, but in each case, if and only to the extent permitted by, and subject to the limitations set forth in, this letter agreement. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this letter agreement, or in any agreement or instrument delivered or statement made or action taken in connection herewith or otherwise, by their acceptance of the benefits of letter agreement, the Company hereby covenants, acknowledges and agrees that:

  

  

(a) (i) rights of the Company as a third party beneficiary as set forth in
this letter agreement, (ii) remedies against Parent or Merger Sub and their
successors or assignees under the Merger Agreement and (iii) remedies against
Investor under the Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of June 16, 2017
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), by and between Investor and the Company
(collectively, the " _Retained Claims_ "), in each case, shall, and are
intended to be, the sole and exclusive direct or indirect remedies available
to the Company against any Non-Recourse Party (as defined herein) in respect
of any liabilities arising under, or in connection with, this letter
agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including without limitation in
the event Parent or Merger Sub breaches its obligations under the Merger
Agreement, whether or not such breach is caused by Investor's breach of its
obligations under this letter agreement; and

  

  

(b) other than as expressly set forth in _Section 3(a)_ above solely with
respect to Investor, Parent and/or Merger Sub (including their respective
successors and assignees), by its acceptance of the benefits of this letter
agreement, as applicable (i) no Person (other than Investor) has any
obligations hereunder, and no recourse shall be had hereunder (or for any
claim hereunder based on, in respect of, or by reason of the obligations of
Investor hereunder) against, and no personal liability shall attach to, be
imposed upon, or otherwise incurred by, any Non-Recourse Party in connection
with this letter agreement, the Merger Agreement, Confidentiality Agreement or
otherwise, through Parent, Merger Sub or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited liability company or limited
partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any other Person against any Non-Recourse Party, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any applicable Law, or otherwise.

  

  

As used herein, the term " _Non-Recourse Parties_ " shall mean, individually
or collectively, any direct or indirect former, current or future holders of
any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, affiliates,
lenders, members, managers, general or limited partners, shareholders or
assignees of Investor, Parent, Merger Sub and any and all direct or indirect
former, current or future holders of any equity, partnership or limited
liability company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers,

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES ASSERTS IN ANY LEGAL ACTION THE WILLFUL BREACH CAP AMOUNT CAPPING INVESTOR'S LIABILITY FOR A BREACH OF THIS LETTER AGREEMENT (OR, IN THE CASE OF A TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 8.1(C) OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE AGREED UPON LIQUIDATED DAMAGES EQUAL TO THE PARENT TERMINATION FEE) IS ILLEGAL, INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OR THAT INVESTOR IS LIABLE PURSUANT TO _SECTION 5_ IN EXCESS OF OR TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE WILLFUL BREACH CAP AMOUNT (OR, IN THE CASE OF A TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 8.1(C) OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE PARENT TERMINATION FEE), THEN (X) THE OBLIGATIONS OF INVESTOR UNDER THIS LETTER AGREEMENT SHALL TERMINATE AB INITIO AND BE NULL AND VOID, (Y) IF INVESTOR HAS PREVIOUSLY MADE ANY PAYMENTS UNDER THIS LETTER AGREEMENT, IT SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER SUCH PAYMENTS, AND (Z) NEITHER INVESTOR NOR THE NON-RECOURSE PARTIES SHALL HAVE ANY FURTHER LIABILITY WHATSOEVER (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE OR OTHERWISE) TO ANY PERSON UNDER THIS LETTER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING SUCH PERSON'S EQUITYHOLDERS AND AFFILIATES.

5. _Investor Obligations_.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (but in all cases subject,
for the avoidance of doubt, to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
set forth in _Section 2_ ), Investor hereby absolutely, irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company the due and
punctual performance and discharge of all of the payment obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement (collectively, the " _Guaranteed
Obligations_ "); _provided_ , that in no event shall the aggregate liability
of Investor hereunder exceed the Willful Breach Cap Amount (or, in the case of
a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c) of the Merger Agreement, exceed an
amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee). If Parent or Merger Sub fails to
discharge any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations when due, upon the
Company's demand, Investor's liability to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereunder in respect of such portion of the Guaranteed Obligations shall
become immediately due and payable, and the Company may at any time and from
time to time, at the Company's option, and so long as Parent and Merger Sub
have failed to discharge the Guaranteed Obligations, take any and all actions
available hereunder to collect Investor's liabilities hereunder in respect of
such Guaranteed Obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing, Investor
acknowledges that the Company may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute
a separate action or actions against Investor for the unsatisfied Guaranteed
Obligations, regardless of whether any such action is brought against Parent
or Merger Sub or whether Parent or Merger Sub is joined in any such action or
actions. For the avoidance of doubt, Investor may satisfy any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations with a direct payment to the Company and in no event
will Investor have any obligation to contribute such amount to the capital of
Parent or Merger Sub, and such direct payment will be considered as
satisfaction (to the extent of such payment) of Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations under the applicable provision of the Merger Agreement and of
Investor's obligations under this _Section 5_. The guarantee of payment
obligations of Investor under this _Section 5_ shall be referred to as the "
_Guarantee_ ".

  

  

(b) Investor's liability under this _Section 5_ is absolute, unconditional,
irrevocable and continuing irrespective of any modification, amendment or
waiver of or any consent to departure from the Merger Agreement that may be
agreed to by the parties to the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms
of the Merger Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Company,
Merger Sub or the Company shall be obligated to file any claim relating to the
Guaranteed Obligations in the event that Parent or Merger Sub becomes subject
to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to so file shall not affect Investor's
obligations hereunder. The Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not of
collection. In the event that any payment to the Company in respect of any
Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned to Parent,
Merger Sub or Investor for any reason whatsoever, Investor shall remain liable
hereunder with respect to the unpaid Guaranteed Obligations as if such payment
had not been made.

  

  

 

6  

  

(c) Investor agrees that the Company may, in its sole discretion, at any time
and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of Investor,
extend the time of payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and may also
enter into any agreement with Parent and Merger Sub for the extension,
renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in
part, without in any way impairing or affecting Investor's obligations under
the Guarantee or affecting the validity or enforceability of the obligations
of Investor under this _Section 5_. Subject to termination of this letter
agreement as provided herein, Investor agrees that the obligations of Investor
hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or
otherwise affected by: (i) the failure or delay on the part of the Company to
assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent,
Merger Sub or Investor; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of
payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any waiver, compromise,
consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or
provisions of the Merger Agreement made in accordance with the terms thereof;
(iii) any change in the legal existence, structure or ownership of Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise interested in the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; or (iv) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding instituted by or against Parent or
Merger Sub. Investor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of
the Guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of
any Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all (other than notices to Parent
pursuant to the Merger Agreement), all defenses which may be available by
virtue of any stay, moratorium or other similar law now or hereafter in effect
or any right to require the marshaling of assets of Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations. Investor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
and that the waivers set forth in the Guarantee are knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits.

  

  

(d) Investor hereby unconditionally waives any rights that it may now have or
hereafter acquire against Parent or Merger Sub that arise from the existence,
payment, performance, or enforcement of Investor's obligations under or in
respect of the Guarantee, including, without limitation, any right of
subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5_ or
otherwise, in addition to any contractual defenses of Investor on the basis of
a breach of this letter agreement, Investor shall have all defenses to the
payment of its obligations under this _Section 5_ that would be available to
Parent, Merger Sub or any assignee in respect of the Merger Agreement with
respect to the Guaranteed Obligations (other than bankruptcy or other
inability to pay the Guaranteed Obligations of Parent or Merger Sub).

  

  

 

7  

  

(f) Unless terminated pursuant to _Section 6_ , the Guarantee may not be
revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and effect until the
Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full.

  

  

6. _Expiration_. All obligations under this letter agreement shall expire and terminate automatically and immediately and cease to be of any further force or effect upon the earliest to occur of (a) the consummation of the Closing, if the Closing occurs and all payments required to be made by Parent or Merger Sub at Closing are made, at which time the obligation of Investor hereunder will be fulfilled, (b) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Article VIII of the Merger Agreement in circumstances where no Guaranteed Obligations are payable (" _Non-Qualifying Termination_ "), (c) the date that is 180 days after any termination of the Merger Agreement (other than a Non-Qualifying Termination) unless the Company shall have commenced litigation or arbitration against Investor under and pursuant to this letter agreement prior to the 180th day following such termination, in which case this letter agreement shall terminate only upon the final, non-appealable resolution of such litigation or arbitration and/or satisfaction by Investor of any obligations finally determined or agreed to be owed by Investor, consistent with the terms hereof), and (d) the assertion by or on behalf of the Company or its affiliates in any litigation of any claim against Investor, Parent, Merger Sub or any Non-Recourse Party other than as specifically permitted by _Section 3_ above. Upon termination of this letter agreement, Investor and its permitted assignees shall not have any further liabilities hereunder.

  

  

7. _No Assignment_. Neither this letter agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assignable by Parent or Merger Sub without Investor's and the Company's prior written consent, and the granting of such consent in any given instance shall be in the sole discretion of Investor and the Company, as applicable, and, if granted, shall not constitute a waiver of this requirement as to any subsequent assignment. Any purported assignment in contravention of this _Section 7_ shall be void. Investor may not assign its obligations to fund the Commitment or with respect to the Guarantee; _provided,_ _however_ , that, without the consent of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, Investor may assign its rights, interests and obligations under this letter agreement to any other Person, provided that no such assignment shall (a) relieve Investor of its obligations hereunder or (b) impede or delay the Merger or require any regulatory filings that would reasonably be expected to delay the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Parent and Merger Sub may assign their rights under this letter agreement with respect to the Commitment to any Person to which Parent or Merger Sub assigns its interest in the Merger Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. Investor acknowledges that the Company has entered into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon, among other things, this letter agreement.

  

  

 

8  

  

8. _No Other Beneficiaries_. Parent, Merger Sub and Investor acknowledge that the Company shall be a third party beneficiary of the provisions set forth in this letter agreement, as limited by the terms hereof and the limitations in the Merger Agreement. Except for third party beneficiary rights provided in this letter agreement, this letter agreement shall be binding on Investor solely for the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, and nothing set forth in this letter agreement is intended to or shall confer upon or give to any Person other than Parent and Merger Sub (but solely at the direction of the Investor as contemplated hereby) any benefits, rights or remedies under or by reason of, or any rights to enforce or cause Parent or Merger Sub to enforce the Commitment or any provision of this letter agreement; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this letter agreement, any Non-Recourse Party shall be a third party beneficiary of the provisions set forth herein that are for the benefit of any Non-Recourse Party (including the provisions of _Sections 3_ , _6_ , _7_ , _8_ , _10_ , _11_ , _12_ , _14_ and _15_ ), and all such provisions shall survive any termination of this letter agreement indefinitely. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent's and Merger Sub's creditors shall have no right to enforce this letter agreement or to cause Parent or Merger Sub to enforce this letter agreement.

  

  

9. _Representations and Warranties_. Investor hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that (a) it has all necessary power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this letter agreement; (b) the execution, delivery and performance of this letter agreement by Investor has been duly and validly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate action, and no other proceedings or actions on the part of Investor are necessary therefor; (c) this letter agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by it and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of it, enforceable against Investor in accordance with its terms (subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)); (d) the execution, delivery and performance by Investor of its obligations under this letter agreement do not and will not violate the organizational documents of Investor, any material contract to which Investor is party or any applicable Law; and (e) Investor has the financial capacity to pay and perform its obligations under this letter agreement and all funds necessary for Investor to fulfill its obligations under this letter agreement shall be available to Investor for so long as this letter agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

  

  

10. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this letter agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision of this letter agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this letter agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that this letter agreement may not be enforced without giving effect to the provisions of _Sections 2_ through _7_ , _10_ , _11_ and _12_ hereof. No party hereto shall assert, and each party hereto shall cause its respective affiliates not to assert, that this letter agreement or any part hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

11. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction._ This letter agreement, and any Legal Proceeding arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this letter agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Law of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Law that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to
shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to
the Corporation. Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be
entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation by
any two duly authorized officers of the Corporation. Any of or all the
signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer,
transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has
been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer
agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the
Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer
agent, or registrar at the date of issue.

  

  

Section 2. _Transfers_. Transfers of stock of the Corporation shall be made on
the books of the Corporation only upon surrender to the Corporation of a
certificate (if any) for the shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper
evidence of succession, assignment, or authority to transfer, _provided_ such
succession, assignment, or transfer is not prohibited by the Certificate of
Incorporation, these Bylaws, applicable law, or contract. Thereupon, the
Corporation shall issue a new certificate (if requested) to the person
entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate (if any), and record the
transaction upon its books.

  

  

Section 3. _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. Any person claiming a
certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed shall make an affidavit
or an affirmation of that fact, and shall give the Corporation a bond of
indemnity in satisfactory form and with one or more satisfactory sureties,
whereupon a new certificate (if requested) may be issued of the same tenor and
for the same number of shares as the one alleged to be lost, stolen, or
destroyed.

  

  

Section 4. _Record Stockholders_. The Corporation shall be entitled to
recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner
of shares as the person entitled to exercise the rights of a stockholder and
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in
any such shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have
express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

  

  

 

6  

  

Section 5. _Additional Powers of the Board_.

  

  

(a) In addition to those powers set forth in Section 2 of Article III, the
Board of Directors shall have power and authority to make all such rules and
regulations as it shall deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer, and
registration of certificates for shares of stock of the Corporation, including
the use of uncertificated shares of stock subject to the provisions of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

  

  

(b) The Board of Directors may appoint and remove transfer agents and
registrars of transfers, and may require all stock certificates to bear the
signature of any such transfer agent and/or any such registrar of transfers.

  

  

ARTICLE VI

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

Section 1. _Indemnification_. The Corporation shall indemnify, to the full
extent that it shall have power under applicable law to do so and in a manner
permitted by such law, any person made or threatened to be made a party to or
is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit,
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative
(hereinafter, a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such person, or a
person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of Corporation
as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, or other enterprise. The Corporation may indemnify, to the full extent
that it shall have power under applicable law to do so and in a manner
permitted by such law, any person made or threatened to be made party to any
Proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or
agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, or other enterprise. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
except as otherwise provided in Section 3 of this Article VI, the Corporation
shall be required to indemnify any person in connection with a Proceeding (or
part thereof) commenced by such person only if the commencement of such
Proceeding (or part thereof) by the person was authorized in the specific case
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

  

  

Section 2. _Advancement of Expenses_. With respect to any person made or
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed
Proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom he or
she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation, the Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys'
fees) incurred by such person in defending any such Proceeding in advance of
its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the payment of expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred
by such person in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding shall be
made only upon receipt of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking") by
such person to repay all amounts advanced if it shall ultimately be determined
by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal
(hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such person is not entitled to be
indemnified for such expenses under this Article VI or otherwise. With respect
to any person made or threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding, by
reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, the Corporation may, in its
discretion and upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation
deems appropriate, pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by
such person in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition.

  

  

 

7  

  

Section 3. _Claims_. With respect to any person made or threatened to be made
a party to any Proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, the rights to indemnification and
to the advancement of expenses conferred in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article
VI shall be contract rights. If a claim under Sections 1 or 2 of this Article
VI with respect to such rights is not paid in full by the Corporation within
60 days after a written demand has been received by the Corporation, except in
the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses by an officer or director
of the Corporation, in which case the applicable period shall be 30 days, the
person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or an advancement of
expenses hereunder may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole
or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to
recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking,
the person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or an advancement of
expenses hereunder or the person from whom the Corporation seeks to recover an
advancement of expenses shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses
(including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting or defending such suit. In any suit
brought by a person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder
(but not in a suit brought by a person seeking to enforce a right to an
advancement of expenses hereunder) it shall be a defense that the person
seeking to enforce a right to indemnification has not met any applicable
standard for indemnification under applicable law. In any suit brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a
final adjudication that the person from whom the Corporation seeks to recover
an advancement of expenses has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification under applicable law. With respect to any suit brought by a
person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (including any
suit seeking to enforce a right to the advancement of expenses hereunder) or
any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, neither the failure of the
Corporation to have made a determination prior to commencement of such suit
that indemnification of such person is proper in the circumstances because
such person has met the applicable standards of conduct under applicable law,
nor an actual determination by the Corporation that such person has not met
such applicable standards of conduct, shall create a presumption that such
person has not met the applicable standards of conduct or, in a case brought
by such person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification, be a defense to
such suit. In any suit brought by a person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the burden of proving that the person seeking to enforce a right
to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses or the person from whom
the Corporation seeks to recover an advancement of expenses is not entitled to
be indemnified, or to such an advancement of expenses, under this Article VI
or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

  

  

Section 4. _Non-exclusive Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided in this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which any person indemnified may be entitled under any bylaw,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both
as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be such director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such person.

  

  

Section 5. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of
the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or
arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the
provisions of this Article VI or otherwise.

  

  

 

8  

  

Section 6. _Primacy of Indemnity_. The Corporation hereby acknowledges that
certain of its Directors, officers, employees and agents (the " _Fund
Indemnitees_ ") may have rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and/or insurance with respect to their service on the Board of Directors or
otherwise in connection with their involvement with the Corporation provided
by persons other than the Corporation, its indirect parent, LB Yankee, Inc.
(the " _Holding Company_ "), and the direct or indirect subsidiaries of the
Holding Company that are direct or indirect parents of the Corporation (such
other persons collectively, the " _Fund Indemnitors_ "). The Corporation
hereby agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort relative to the
Fund Indemnitors (i.e., its obligations to the Fund Indemnitees are primary
and any obligation of the Fund Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by the Fund
Indemnitees are secondary) and (ii) that it irrevocably waives, relinquishes
and releases the Fund Indemnitors from any and all claims against the Fund
Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in
respect thereof, except to the extent that a Fund Indemnitee breaches its
undertaking to repay advanced expenses as provided in Sections 2 or 3 of this
Article VI. The Corporation further agrees that no advancement or payment by
the Fund Indemnitors on behalf of the Fund Indemnitees with respect to any
claim for which the Fund Indemnitees have sought indemnification from the
Corporation shall affect the foregoing and the Fund Indemnitors shall have a
right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement
or payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Fund Indemnitees against
the Corporation.

  

  

Section 7. _Amendment or Repeal_. Any right to indemnification or to
advancement of expenses of any person arising hereunder shall not be
eliminated or impaired by an amendment to or repeal of these Bylaws after the
occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which
indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought.

  

  

ARTICLE VII

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

Section 1. _Place and Inspection of Books_.

  

  

(a) The books of the Corporation other than such books as are required by law
to be kept within the State of Delaware shall be kept in such place or places
either within or without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may
from time to time determine.

  

  

(b) The officer who has charge of the stock ledger shall prepare and make, at
least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (provided, however, if the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days
before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders
entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open
to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting
at least 10 days prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably accessible
electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to
such list is provided with the notice of meeting or (ii) during ordinary
business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. If the
meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote
at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication,
then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during
the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network,
and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the
notice of the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger
shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine
the list of stockholders required by this Section 1(b) of Article VII or to
vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

  

  

(c) The Board of Directors shall determine from time to time whether and, if
allowed, when and under what conditions and regulations the accounts and books
of the Corporation (except such as may be by law specifically open to
inspection or as otherwise provided by these Bylaws) or any of them shall be
open to the inspection of the stockholders and the stockholders' rights in
respect thereof.

  

  

 

9  

  

Section 2. _Waivers of Notice._ Any waiver of notice, given by the person
entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be
deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends
a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the
purpose of any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or
members of a committee of directors need be specified in a waiver of notice.

  

  

Section 3. _Voting Shares in Other Corporations_. The President or any other
officer of the Corporation designated by the Board of Directors may vote any
and all shares held by the Corporation in any other corporation.

  

  

Section 4. _Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be such
fiscal year as the Board of Directors from time to time by resolution shall
determine.

  

  

Section 5. _Gender/Number_. As used in these Bylaws, the masculine, feminine,
or neuter gender, and the singular and plural number, shall each include the
other whenever the context so indicates.

  

  

Section 6. _Paragraph Titles_. The titles of the paragraphs have been inserted
as a matter of reference only and shall not control or affect the meaning or
construction of any of the terms and provisions hereof.

  

  

Section 7. _Amendment_. These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, and
new bylaws made, by the Board of Directors or by the stockholders of the
Corporation.

  

  

Section 8. _Certificate of Incorporation_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, if any provision contained in these Bylaws is
inconsistent with or conflicts with a provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation, such provision of these Bylaws shall be superseded by the
inconsistent provision in the Certificate of Incorporation to the extent
necessary to give effect to such provision in the Certificate of
Incorporation.

  

  

Section 9. _Forum for Internal Corporate Claims_. Unless the Corporation
consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of
Chancery in the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for
all "internal corporate claims." "Internal corporate claims" mean claims,
including claims in the right of the Corporation, (i) that are based upon a
violation of a duty by a current or former director or officer or stockholder
in such capacity or (ii) as to which Title 8 of the Delaware Code confers
jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery, except for, as to each of (i) through
(ii) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there
is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such
determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or
forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery
does not have subject matter jurisdiction; _provided_ , _however_ , if (and
only if) the Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware shall
be the sole and exclusive forum for all "internal corporate claims" unless the
Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum. If
any provision or provisions of this Section 9 of Article VII shall be held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or
circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any
other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Section 9 of
Article VII (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of
this Section 9 of Article VII containing any such provision held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other
persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby.
