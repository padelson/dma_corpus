subject to increase or decrease, as the case may be, as provided in the
following sentence, and Buyer (or controlled Affiliates designated by Buyer)

Expenses as of the Closing Date and a list of the Persons that are owed such
amounts (the "Closing Date Transaction Expenses"), (iv) an estimate of

and will include a breakdown and reasonable detail in support of the
calculation of items (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) in the preceding sentence as
between the Galveston Sellers, the Kansas City Sellers and the New Braunfels
Sellers. Buyer shall have the opportunity to review and comment on the Closing

minus (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Asset Value is less

the amount of Closing Date Transaction Expenses as set forth on the Closing
Statement, minus (iv) the amount of Closing Date Indebtedness as set forth on

Galveston Sellers is the "Galveston Closing Payment Amount"; (ii) to the New
Braunfels Sellers is the "New Braunfels Closing Payment Amount"); and (iii) to
the Kansas City Sellers is the "Kansas City Closing Payment Amount").



(e) At the Closing, Buyer shall:



(i) deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to be held and distributed in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement;



(ii) pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds the Closing Date
Transaction Expenses to each respective Person owed such amounts, on behalf of
and for the benefit of the Seller Parties, pursuant to written instructions
provided to Buyer by the Sellers' Representative;



(iii) pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds all of the Closing
Date Indebtedness to each respective debt holder owed such amounts, on behalf
of and for the benefit of the Seller Parties pursuant to written instructions
provided to Buyer by the Sellers' Representative;

(3) accounts designated by the Galveston Sellers to Buyer prior to the Closing
Date, to the following Persons: (i) ANICO Eagle, LLC, (ii) ANH20, Inc., and

whatsoever regarding the payment and distribution of the Galveston Closing
Payment Amount; and



(v) pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Sellers' Representative, an aggregate amount equal to the
sum of the New Braunfels Closing Payment Amount and the Kansas City Closing

the terms of this Agreement, and the following modifications shall be made to
Sections 2.02(a)-(e):



(i) the Base Amount shall be reduced by Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000) (the
"Kansas City Purchase Price"), such that the Base Amount for the Assets
relating to the Galveston Waterpark and the New Braunfels Waterpark is Two
Hundred Sixty-One Million Dollars ($261,000,000);



(ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness for the Texas Transaction shall be reduced
by the amount of any Indebtedness that is applicable to the Kansas City
Waterpark and that is set forth on Schedule 2.02(f)(ii) (the "Kansas City

(iii) for the avoidance of doubt, for the Texas Transaction, no Closing
Payment Amount shall be allocated to the Kansas City Sellers, and the Closing
Payment Amount that is due to the Galveston Sellers and the New Braunfels
Sellers, as applicable, will be allocated among such Seller Parties according
to the percentages set forth on Exhibit G; and 



(iv) for the avoidance of doubt, for the Texas Transaction, the Estimated Net

(g) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event of a Delayed KC Closing Scenario, at the KC Delayed Closing:



(i) Buyer shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds the

Parties and the Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated among the Assets for

Exhibit G attached hereto. Buyer shall prepare and deliver IRS Form 8594,
consistent with the purchase price allocation attached hereto, to Sellers'
Representative within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date to be filed
with the IRS. Each Seller agrees that promptly after such Seller's receipt of
the IRS Form 8594 it shall return an executed copy thereof to Buyer (through
the Sellers' Representative). Buyer and Sellers' Representative each agree to
file IRS Form 8594, and all related United States federal, state and local,
and non-U.S., Tax Returns consistent with the purchase price allocation
attached hereto. Buyer and Sellers' Representative each agrees to provide the
other promptly with any other information required to complete IRS Form 8594.
Furthermore, any event occurring post-Closing that requires a purchase price
adjustment will result in both Buyer and Sellers' Representative amending Form
8594 as may be required under the Code and regulations thereunder.



2.08 Closing Financial Statements; Purchase Price Adjustments.



(a) As soon as practicable following the Closing, but in no event later than
One Hundred Twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to the Sellers' Representative a report (the
"Adjustment Report"), which shall set forth and show in reasonable detail
Buyer's computation of: (i) the book value of the Current Assets, the amount
of Current Liabilities, and the corresponding Net Asset Value, all as of the
Closing Date, (ii) Indebtedness as of the Closing, (iii) Transaction Expenses
as of the Closing, (iv) the computation of the Positive Adjustment Amount or
Negative Adjustment Amount, as set forth in Section 2.08(d), and (v) the
computation of the Purchase Price based on item (i) of this sentence. The
Adjustment Report shall be calculated and prepared in accordance with GAAP and
will provide reasonable detail with respect to items (i), (ii) and (iii),
including a breakdown of those items as between the Galveston Sellers, the
Kansas City Sellers and the New Braunfels Sellers. The book value of the
Current Assets as reflected on the Adjustment Report shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Asset Value" and the amount of the Current Liabilities as
reflected on the Adjustment Report shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"Liability Amount." The term "Net Asset Value" means an amount (expressed as a
positive or negative number, as necessary) equal to the Asset Value, minus the
Liability Amount.



(b) Within fifteen (15) Business Days after Buyer's delivery of the Adjustment
Report, the Sellers' Representative may deliver a written notice (a "Protest
Notice") to Buyer of any objections to the Adjustment Report, in reasonable
detail, indicating each disputed item or amount (the "Disputed Matters") and
the basis for the disagreement with how such Disputed Matter is calculated in
the Adjustment Report. During the ten (10) Business Days (the "Resolution
Period") following Buyer's receipt of a Protest Notice, Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative shall attempt to resolve any Disputed Matters. If at the end of
the Resolution Period, Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall have failed
to resolve their dispute, the Disputed Matters only shall be referred to Ernst
and Young or such other accounting firm of national reputation as may be agreed
to by Buyer and the Sellers' Representative (the "Adjustment Arbitrator"), for
final determination of the Disputed Matters only within forty-five (45) days
after the date of such referral. The Adjustment Arbitrator shall only decide
the Disputed Matters and their decision for each Disputed Matter must be
within the range of values assigned to each such item in the Adjustment Report
and the Protest Notice, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, if Sellers'
Representative does not include any item from the Adjustment Report as a
Disputed Matter in the Protest Notice, then Sellers' Representative shall be
deemed to have accepted the calculation of such item in the Adjustment Report
and such calculation shall be final. This provision for arbitration shall be
specifically enforceable by the parties, and the determination of the
Adjustment Arbitrator with respect to the Disputed Matters in accordance with
the provisions hereof shall be final and binding upon Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative, with no right of appeal therefrom. The fees and expenses of
the Adjustment Arbitrator for each Disputed Matter shall be paid by the party
(i.e., Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of
the Seller Parties), on the other hand) whose last proposed written offer for
the settlement of the applicable Disputed Matter prior to the commencement of
such arbitration, taken as a whole, was farther away from the final
determination of the Adjustment Arbitrator. If the final determination of the
Adjustment Arbitrator is equal to the difference between the last proposed
written offers of Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers' Representative, on
the other hand, then Buyer and the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the
Seller Parties) shall each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the
Adjustment Arbitrator with respect to the applicable Disputed Matter.



(c) If Sellers' Representative accepts the Adjustment Report as delivered or
does not timely deliver a Protest Notice, then Sellers' Representative shall
be deemed to have accepted the calculation of the Net Asset Value as of the
Closing Date, 

Indebtedness as of the Closing, Transaction Expenses as of the Closing, and
the corresponding Positive Adjustment Amount or Negative Adjustment Amount, as
the case may be, and Purchase Price, as applicable, all as set forth in the
Adjustment Report. If the Sellers' Representative timely delivers a Protest
Notice in accordance with Section 2.08(b), then any of the Net Asset Value,
Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses or the corresponding Positive Adjustment
Amount or Negative Adjustment Amount, as the case may be, and Purchase Price,
as applicable, that are included in the Protest Notice as a Disputed Matter
shall be determined in accordance with the arbitration mechanism set forth in
Section 2.08(b).



(d) If the Final Net Asset Value is greater than the Estimated Net Asset
Value, then the amount of such difference is referred to herein as the
"Positive Adjustment Amount". If the Final Net Asset Value is less than the
Estimated Net Asset Value, then the amount of such difference is referred to
herein as the "Negative Adjustment Amount".



(e) If there is a Positive Adjustment Amount under Section 2.08(d), then Buyer
shall pay to the Galveston Sellers and the New Braunfels Sellers (in
accordance with the allocation set forth in the following sentence, with one
wire transfer of immediately available funds being sent to the Galveston
Sellers and a separate wire transfer of immediately available funds being sent
to the Sellers' Representative for distribution to the New Braunfels Sellers),
an aggregate amount equal to the Positive Adjustment Amount within five (5)
Business Days after Buyer's receipt of the Allocation Notice from Sellers'
Representative; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, in no event shall the Seller Parties be entitled to recover
under this section more than an aggregate amount equal to the sum of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnity Escrow Amount. Within three (3)
Business Days after the amounts set forth on the Adjustment Report are finally
determined under Section 2.08(c) the Sellers' Representative shall provide to
Buyer an allocation (the "Allocation Notice") of the Positive Adjustment
Amount as between the Galveston Sellers and the New Braunfels Sellers, along
with wire transfer instructions for the Galveston Sellers and the Sellers'
Representative (for distribution to the New Braunfels Sellers). In addition,
within five (5) Business Days after Buyer's receipt of the Allocation Notice
from Sellers' Representative, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release to the Galveston Sellers and the Sellers' Representative (for
distribution to the New Braunfels Sellers) the Adjustment Escrow Amount in
accordance with the Allocation Notice.



(f) If there is a Negative Adjustment Amount under Section 2.08(d), then,
within five (5) Business Days after the amounts set forth on the Adjustment
Report are finally determined under Section 2.08(c), Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to:



| 
---|--- 

i.

|

disburse to Buyer the Negative Adjustment Amount from the Adjustment Escrow
Account (and to the extent the Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient, from
the Indemnity Escrow Account); it being understood that, in no event shall
Buyer be entitled to recover more than the sum of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
and the Indemnity Escrow Amount; it being further understood that the Seller
Parties will replenish any and all funds used from the Indemnity Escrow
Account to pay the Negative Adjustment Amount within five (5) Business Days of
such funds being disbursed from the Indemnity Escrow Account; and 

| 
---|--- 

ii.

|

disburse to the Galveston Sellers and the New Braunfels Sellers (in accordance
with the Allocation Notice, with one wire transfer of immediately available
funds being sent to the Galveston Sellers and a separate wire transfer of
immediately available funds being sent to the Sellers' Representative for
distribution to the New Braunfels Sellers) any remaining funds in the
Adjustment Escrow Account (if any). 

(g) If the Final Indebtedness is greater than the Closing Date Indebtedness,
then, to the extent that Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) actually assumes or
otherwise suffers any Losses with respect to such difference, then Buyer and
Sellers' Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer the amount of such
difference (to the extent of such assumption and/or Losses) from the
Adjustment Escrow Account (and to the extent the amount in the Adjustment
Escrow Account is insufficient, from the Indemnity Escrow Account). If the
Final Transaction Expenses are greater than the Closing Date Transaction
Expenses, then, to the extent that Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) actually
assumes or otherwise suffers any Losses with respect to such difference, then
Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer the amount
of such difference (to the extent of such assumption and/or Losses) from the
Adjustment Escrow Account (and to the extent the amount in the Adjustment
Escrow Account is insufficient, from the Indemnity Escrow Account). In
addition, the Seller Parties will replenish any and all funds used from the
Indemnity Escrow Account to pay for the Losses described in this Section
2.08(g) within five (5) Business Days of such funds being disbursed from the
Indemnity Escrow Account.



(h) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a Delayed KC Closing Scenario,
(i) for the Texas Transaction, the Adjustment Report will not include the
Kansas City Purchase Price, the Kansas City Indebtedness or the Kansas City
Transaction Expenses, and (ii) for the KC Delayed Closing, no Adjustment
Report is required. If at any time after the KC Delayed Closing, Buyer (or any
of its Affiliates) actually assumes or otherwise suffers any Losses with
respect to the Kansas City Indebtedness or the Kansas City Transaction
Expenses, as applicable, then Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall deliver
joint written instructions 

to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer the
amount of any and all such Losses from the Adjustment Escrow Account (and to
the extent the amount in the Adjustment Escrow Account is insufficient or if
the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account have already been released, as
applicable, from the Indemnity Escrow Account). In addition, the Seller
Parties will replenish any and all funds used from the Indemnity Escrow
Account to pay for the Losses described in this Section 2.08(h) within five
(5) Business Days of such funds being disbursed from the Indemnity Escrow
Account.

THE SELLER PARTIES



Each of the Seller Parties represents and warrants as follows with respect to

Agreement, and the other Acquisition Documents to which it is a party, and the
performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and no further
authorization or consent of the Governing Authority is required in order to
approve the consummation of the Subject Transactions. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Seller Parties and upon the execution and
delivery of the remaining Acquisition Documents by a duly authorized officer
of Seller, the remaining Acquisition Documents will have been duly executed
and delivered by the Seller Parties, and this Agreement is, and such other
Acquisition Documents will be, upon due execution and delivery thereof, the

against them in accordance with the respective terms thereof.

3.02 Title and Sufficiency of Assets; Inventory.

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.02, (i) Seller has, and Buyer will have
upon Closing, good and indefeasible title to all of the Seller's Assets, free

except for properties and assets, which have been sold or otherwise disposed
of in the Ordinary Course of Business since the Balance Sheet Date, Seller has
not sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of any of its assets since the

Assets, including, without limitation, the Improvements and Tangible Personal
Property, are in good operating condition, are adequate for the purpose used,
and none of such tangible assets are in need of maintenance or repairs except
for ordinary, routine maintenance and repairs that are not material in nature
or costs. As of the Closing Date, the Seller's Assets are sufficient for the
continued operation of the Parks after the Closing Date in substantially the
same manner as conducted prior to the Closing Date, including, without
limitation, the right to access the amount of water necessary to operate the
Parks and dispose of such water in compliance with all Laws. None of the
Excluded Assets are material to the business or operation of the Parks.



(b) All items of inventory and Supplies (including raw materials, work-in-

are merchantable and are held for sale in the Ordinary Course of Business as
first quality goods at normal mark-ups, none of such items is obsolete or
below standard quality, and each item of such inventory reflected on the
Balance Sheet and the books and records of Seller is so reflected on the basis

duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in all
jurisdiction(s) set forth on Schedule 3.03, and Seller is duly licensed or
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the ownership of Seller's Assets or the business or operation of the Parks as
currently conducted makes such licensing or qualification necessary. No other
jurisdiction has demanded, requested or otherwise indicated in writing that
Seller is required to so qualify on account of the ownership or leasing of the
Seller's Assets or the business or operation of the Parks. Seller has provided
to Buyer true and complete copies of all of the Organizational Documents for
Seller.



3.04 Subsidiaries and Investments. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04,
Seller does not, directly or indirectly own, of record or beneficially, any

prepared from the books and records of Seller in accordance with GAAP and
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of Seller with
respect to the business and operation of the Parks.



(b) Seller maintains internal controls over financial reporting that provide
reasonable assurance that: (i) receipts and expenditures are made, and access
to Seller's assets are permitted only in accordance with, management's
authorization; (ii) Seller's books and records accurately and fairly reflect
in reasonable detail the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
Seller; and (iii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements of Seller in accordance with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for the assets of Seller.



3.06 No Material Changes. Since the Balance Sheet Date, and except as
reflected on Schedule 3.06, Seller has operated the Parks in the Ordinary
Course of Business and there has been (a) no Material Adverse Effect, (b) no
fact or condition exists or is contemplated, or, to the Knowledge of the
Seller Parties, threatened, which might cause a material adverse change in the
future, and (c) no event, condition, action, or effect that, if it were to
occur after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, would constitute a
breach of Section 5.01. The statements of income included in the Financial

other income not earned in the Ordinary Course of Business, except as
expressly specified therein.



3.07 Books and Records. The Business Records and other books of account,

action taken by, the Governing Authority of Seller, and committees of the
Governing Authority of Seller, and no meeting of any such Governing Authority,
or committee has been held for which minutes have not been prepared and are
not contained in such minute books. At the Closing, all of the Business
Records will be in the possession of Seller, except to the extent that such
Business Records are Excluded Assets.



3.08 Affiliate Transactions. Neither any Related Person nor any Affiliate of
any Seller has, or has had, any interest in any property or asset (whether
real, personal, or mixed and whether tangible or intangible), used in or
pertaining to the Seller's Assets. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.08,
neither any Related Person nor any Affiliate of any Seller is a party to any
Contract with, has any claim or right against Seller, or owes any Indebtedness
to Seller.



3.09 Real Property and Leases.



(a) Schedule 3.09(a) sets forth each parcel of Owned Real Property, including
with respect to each property, the address location and use. The Seller
Parties have provided Buyer with copies of any title insurance policies,
opinions, abstracts and surveys in the possession or control of Seller with
respect to such parcel. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.09(a), with respect
to each parcel of Owned Real Property: (i) Seller has good and indefeasible
fee simple title, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except for Permitted
Encumbrances; (ii) except as otherwise set forth herein, Seller has not leased
or otherwise granted to any Person the right to use or occupy such Owned Real
Property or any portion thereof; and (iii) to the Knowledge of the Seller
Parties, there are no unrecorded outstanding options, rights of first offer or
rights of first refusal to purchase such Owned Real Property or any portion
thereof or interest therein.



(b) Schedule 3.09(b) sets forth each parcel of Leased Real Property, and a
true and complete list of all leases, subleases, licenses, concessions and
other agreements (whether written or oral), including all amendments,
extensions renewals, guaranties and other agreements with respect thereto,
pursuant to which Seller holds any Leased Real Property (collectively, the
"Leases"). Each applicable Seller has delivered to Buyer a true and complete
copy of each Lease, and will deliver to Buyer within thirty (30) days prior to
Closing estoppel certificates signed by the lessors under each material Lease
being assigned to Buyer, in form and content reasonably satisfactory to Buyer,
setting forth each of the items in subsections (i)-(v) (with such below
language being conformed as reasonably necessary to account for the fact that
such estoppel will be given by the landlord rather than the 

applicable Seller) of the following sentence with respect to each such Lease.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.09(b), with respect to each Lease: (i) such
Lease is valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect, and Seller
enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession of the Leased Real Property; (ii)
Seller is not in breach or default under such Lease, and, no event has
occurred or circumstance exists which, with the delivery of notice, passage of
time or both, would constitute such a breach or default, and Seller has paid
all rent due and payable under such Lease; (iii) Seller has not received nor
given any notice of any default or event that with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default by Seller under any of the Leases and, to the
Knowledge of the Seller Parties, no other party is in default thereof, and no
party to any Lease has exercised any termination rights with respect thereto;
(iv) Seller has not subleased, assigned or otherwise granted to any Person the
right to use or occupy such Leased Real Property or any portion thereof; and
(v) Seller has not pledged, mortgaged or otherwise granted an Encumbrance on
its leasehold interest in any Leased Real Property, except, with respect to
the Galveston Lease, the deeds of trust and other Encumbrances in favor of
American National Insurance Company. The Seller Parties acknowledge that such
deeds of trust and other Encumbrances in favor of American National Insurance
Company are to be paid off and released at Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the landlord estoppel certificate for the Galveston Lease would be
substantially in the form as attached to Exhibit E to the Galveston Lease.



(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.09(c), Seller has not received any
written notice of (i) violations of building codes or zoning ordinances or
other governmental or regulatory Laws affecting the Owned Real Property or the
Leased Real Property, (ii) existing, pending or threatened condemnation
proceedings affecting the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property, or
(iii) existing, pending or threatened zoning, building code or other
moratorium proceedings, or similar matters which could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the ability to operate the Owned Real Property or the
Leased Real Property as currently operated. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.09(c), neither the whole nor any portion of any Owned Real Property or the
Leased Real Property has been damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty
since January 1, 2012.

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(b), each Assigned Contract and each
Contract set forth on Schedule 3.10(a) is a valid and binding agreement of
Seller and any other Person that is a party thereto, is in full force and
effect, and is enforceable 

in accordance with its terms. The enforceability of such Contracts will not be
affected in any manner by the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Subject Transactions. Seller has not violated any of the
terms or conditions of any Assigned Contract or any Contract set forth on
Schedule 3.10(a) and is not otherwise in default thereof, and, to the
Knowledge of the Seller Parties, no party to such Contracts other than Seller
is in breach of or default under such Contracts and all of the terms and
conditions to be performed under such Contracts by any party thereto other

of termination on the part of any party thereto. There exists no default or
event of default or event, occurrence, condition or act (including the
purchase of the Seller's Assets hereunder) which, with the giving of notice or
the lapse of time or the happening of any other event or condition, would
become a default or event of default thereunder or result in a termination
thereof or would cause or permit the acceleration or other changes of any
right or obligation or the loss of any benefit thereunder. None of the parties
to any Assigned Contract or any Contract set forth on Schedule 3.10(a) has
given notice (whether written or oral) of its intent to terminate such
Contract and Seller has no reason to believe that any party intends to
terminate any such Contract prior to or following the consummation of the
Subject Transactions. There have been no amendments or modifications to any
Assigned Contract or any Contract set forth on Schedule 3.10(a) which would
make any of the information disclosed herein inaccurate or incomplete.
Complete and correct copies of each of the Assigned Contracts (including all
modifications, amendments and supplements thereto) and Contracts on Schedule
3.10(a) have been made available to Buyer. There are no disputes pending, or
to the Knowledge of the Seller Parties threatened, under any Contract included
in the Seller's Assets.



3.11 No Conflict.

(a) Except for such filings as may be required under the HSR Act and as set
forth on Schedule 3.11(a), neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or any of the other Acquisition Documents nor the consummation or
performance of the Subject Transactions will, directly or indirectly (with or
without notice or lapse of time):

(i) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of (A) any provision
of the Organizational Documents of Seller, or (B) any resolution adopted by
the Governing Authority of Seller that is currently in effect;

(ii) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of, or give any

HSR Act will be duly filed, given, or taken on or prior to the Closing Date,
and (ii) set forth on Schedules 3.11(a) and (b) will be duly filed, requested
or taken on or prior to the Closing Date (except those consents expressly
required by Article VII to be obtained prior to the Closing Date, which will
be obtained and in full force and effect on the Closing Date as a condition to
closing under Article VII).

3.12 Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.12, (a) there is no
Proceeding by any Person, or by or before (or any investigation by) any
Governmental Body, pending, or to the Knowledge of the Seller Parties
threatened, against or affecting Seller, the Seller's Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities, and, to the Knowledge of Seller Parties, there is no valid basis
for any such Proceeding, and (b) neither Seller, Seller's Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities have been subject to any such Proceeding in the past 

five (5) years. There is no pending Proceeding that has been commenced against

and, to the Knowledge of the Seller Parties, no such Proceeding has been
threatened. There are no outstanding Orders and no unsatisfied judgments,
penalties or awards against, relating to or affecting Seller or the Seller's
Assets.



3.13 Tax Returns and Payments. All of the Tax Returns of Seller (and any
Affiliate or predecessor of any Seller that previously owned any of the
Seller's Assets) required by Law to be filed on or before the date of this
Agreement have been duly and timely filed. All such Tax Returns were correct
and complete in all respects and were prepared in substantial compliance with
applicable Law. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13, all Taxes owed by Seller
(and any Affiliate or predecessor of any Seller that previously owned any of
the Seller's Assets), whether or not shown or required to be shown on any Tax
Return, have been paid. There are in effect no waivers or extensions of any
applicable statute of limitations related to such Tax Returns. No claim has
been made by any Governmental Body where Tax Returns have not been filed that
any Seller (or any Affiliate or predecessor of any Seller that previously
owned any of the Seller's Assets) is subject to tax in such jurisdiction.
There are no liens on any of the Seller's Assets with respect to unpaid Taxes.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13, no Seller (or Affiliate or predecessor
of any Seller that previously owned any of the Seller's Assets) is subject to
any audit or dispute in respect of its Taxes, no deficiency assessment or
proposed adjustment for Taxes is pending, and, to the Knowledge of the Seller
Parties, no Seller (or any Affiliate or predecessor of any Seller that
previously owned any of the Seller's Assets) is subject to any Liability for
Taxes, whether or not proposed, with respect to any period through the date of
this Agreement or which could be imposed upon any of its properties or assets.
Each Seller (and any Affiliate or predecessor of any Seller that previously
owned any of the Seller's Assets) has withheld and paid all taxes in
connection with any amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor or other third party, and all Forms W-2 and 1099 required
with respect thereto have been properly completed and filed.



3.14 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Seller does not have, and none of the
Seller's Assets are subject to, any outstanding claims, Liabilities or
Indebtedness, accrued, contingent or otherwise, and whether due or to become
due, except as reflected or reserved against in the Financial Statements (or
referred to in the footnotes thereto) or the Balance Sheet as of the Balance
Sheet Date, or on Schedule 3.14(a), other than Liabilities incurred subsequent
to the Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with
past practice and which are not, individually or in the aggregate, material in
amount. The reserves reflected on the Balance Sheet are adequate, appropriate
and reasonable in accordance with GAAP. To the Knowledge of the Seller
Parties, there is no basis for the assertion against Seller of any Liability
not fully reflected or accrued for on the Balance Sheet. All Closing Date
Indebtedness (as estimated on the date of this Agreement) is set forth on
Schedule 3.14(b). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14(b), Seller is not in
default in respect of the terms or conditions of any Indebtedness, nor are
there any facts which, with the passage of time, would result in any such
default.



3.15 Insurance. Seller has maintained and has in effect such policies of motor
vehicle, property, casualty, workers' compensation, general liability and
other insurance, including group insurance and other life, health, disability
or other insurance for the benefit of employees or their dependents or both as
are required by Law and are adequate and appropriate with respect to the
Seller's Assets. Set forth on Schedule 3.15 is (a) a complete list, with a
summary thereof, of all insurance policies ("Insurance Policies") which Seller
maintains with respect to the Seller's Assets, its properties (including the
Parks) or employees, which Insurance Policies are in full force and effect,

Insurance Policies for the past five (5) years. Neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates has received any written notice of cancellation of, premium
increase with respect to, or alteration of coverage under, any of such
Insurance Policies. All such Insurance Policies (i) are in full force and
effect and enforceable in accordance with their terms; (ii) are provided by
carriers who are financially solvent; and (iii) have not been subject to any
lapse in coverage. None of Seller or any of its Affiliates is in default
under, or has otherwise failed to comply with, in any material respect, any
provision contained in any such Insurance Policy. The Insurance Policies are
sufficient for compliance with all applicable Laws and Contracts to which
Seller is a party or by which it is bound. True and complete copies of the
Insurance Policies have been made available to Buyer.

jurisdiction where the application or registration is located, (C) the

date, and (ii) all Licensed Intellectual Property.



(b) Seller is the sole and exclusive legal, beneficial and, with respect to
registered Intellectual Property, record owner of all right, title and
interest in the Owned Intellectual Property, free and clear of all
Encumbrances. No government funding; facilities of a university, college,
other educational institution or research center; or funding from third

Property, (i) all such Intellectual Property is valid, enforceable, subsisting
and in full force and effect and (ii) Seller has paid all 

registration, renewal and maintenance fees and taxes that are due and payable
in respect of such applications and registrations and made all filings
required to maintain Seller's ownership thereof. There are no facts,
information, or circumstances, including any information or facts that would
constitute prior art, that would render any of the issued or registered Owned
Intellectual Property invalid or unenforceable, or would affect any pending
application for any Owned Intellectual Property. Schedule 3.16(b) sets forth
any actions that must be taken with respect to the applications for and
registrations of Owned Intellectual Property within six (6) months of the
Closing Date, including payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal

Property necessary for, or used or held for use in, the business and operation
of the Parks. Seller owns, licenses or otherwise has valid and enforceable
rights to use all the Purchased Intellectual Property, free and clear of all
Encumbrances. Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder,
will result in the loss or impairment of or payment of any additional amounts
with respect to, nor require the consent of any other Person in respect of,
the Buyer\'s right to own or use any Purchased Intellectual Property. Seller
is not bound by any outstanding judgment, injunction, order or decree
restricting the use of the Purchased Intellectual Property, or restricting the
licensing thereof to any person or entity.



(d) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.16(d), Seller's prior and current use of
the Purchased Intellectual Property and the business and operation of the
Parks as currently and formerly conducted have not, do not and will not
infringe, violate, dilute or misappropriate the Intellectual Property of any
person or entity and there are no claims pending or threatened by any person
or entity (i) claiming that the Seller has infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated any of the Intellectual Property owned by such Person, (ii)
otherwise challenging the ownership, validity, enforceability, registrability,
effectiveness or use of the Purchased Intellectual Property, or (iii) to the
effect that the exercise of rights in any Purchased Intellectual Property by
the Seller or any predecessor-in-interest to any Seller infringes or will
infringe any Intellectual Property right or other proprietary or personal
right of any Person. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.16(d), to the Knowledge
of the Seller Parties, (i) no Person has infringed, misappropriated, diluted
or otherwise violated any Purchased Intellectual Property, (ii) no Person is
infringing, misappropriating, diluting, or otherwise violating any of the
Purchased Intellectual Property, and Seller has not made or asserted any
claim, demand or notice against any Person alleging any such infringement,
misappropriation, dilution or other violation.

and has in the past five (5) years been, in compliance with all Laws
applicable to the business and operation of the Parks or the ownership and use
of the Seller's Assets, including, without limitation, the Federal
Occupational Safety and Health Act, ERISA, Fair Labor Standards Act, all Laws
relating to the safe conduct of business, and all Environmental Health and
Safety Requirements. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17, Seller has not
received any notice of any asserted present or past failure of Seller to
comply with any Laws.

information for each employee, officer or director of Seller, including each
employee on leave of absence or layoff status: employer; name; job title;
full-time, part-time, or seasonal; FLSA classification (exempt or non-exempt);
current compensation paid or payable and any change in compensation since
December 31, 2018; vacation accrued; and service credited for purposes of

profit-sharing, thrift-savings, deferred compensation, stock bonus, stock
option, cash bonus, employee stock ownership (including investment credit or
payroll stock ownership), severance pay, insurance, medical, welfare, or

in Schedule 3.18(a)(ii), all employees are "employees at will" and are
employed directly by a Seller.

(b) Schedule 3.18(b) contains a complete and accurate list of the following
information for each retired employee, officer, manager or director of Seller,
or their dependents, receiving benefits or scheduled to receive benefits in
the future: name, pension benefit, pension option election, retiree medical
insurance coverage, retiree life insurance coverage, and other benefits.

3.19 Labor and Employee Relations; Compliance. Seller has never been and is
not a party to any collective bargaining or other labor Contract. In the past
five (5) years, there has not been, there is not presently pending or
existing, and to Knowledge of the Seller Parties there is not threatened, (a)
any strike, slowdown, picketing, work stoppage, or employee grievance process,
in each case, with respect to Seller's current or former employees, (b) any
Proceeding against or affecting Seller relating to the alleged violation of
any Law pertaining to labor relations or employment matters, including any
charge or complaint filed by an employee or union with the National Labor
Relations Board, the Department of Labor, the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, or any comparable Governmental Body, organizational activity, or
other labor or employment dispute against or affecting Seller or its premises,
or (c) any application for certification of a collective bargaining agent. To
the Knowledge of the Seller Parties, no event has occurred or circumstance
exists that could provide the basis for any work stoppage or other labor 

dispute. There is no lockout of any employees by Seller, and no such action is
contemplated by Seller. Seller has complied in all respects with all Laws
relating to employment, equal employment opportunity, nondiscrimination,
immigration, wages, hours, benefits, collective bargaining, the payment of
social security and similar taxes, occupational safety and health, and plant
closings. Seller does not have any Liabilities in connection with the payment
of any compensation, damages, taxes, fines, penalties, or other amounts,
however designated, for failure to comply with any of the foregoing Laws. All
employees have been properly classified as employees and as exempt or
nonexempt under applicable Law and have been paid properly under applicable
Law. All independent contractors have been properly classified as independent
contractors.

3.20 Employee Benefit Plans.



(a) Set forth on Schedule 3.20 is a complete and accurate list of all Employee
Benefit Plans established, maintained or contributed to by Seller (including
for this purpose and for the purpose of all of the representations in this
Section 3.20, all ERISA Affiliates) at any time during the five (5) year
period ending on the Closing Date.

(b) Seller does not take part in and is not a party to, and has never taken
part in or been a party to, (i) maintaining or contributing to any Employee
Benefit Plan subject to ERISA which is not in material compliance with ERISA
and the Code, or (ii) maintaining or contributing to any employee benefit
plans other than those listed on Schedule 3.20. The assets of Seller's
Employee Benefit Plans are adequate to pay all debts, Liabilities and claims
with respect to such plan to the extent that claims have been made on or prior
to the Closing Date. None of the Employee Benefit Plans ever maintained by
Seller has ever provided health care or any other non-pension benefits to any
employees after their employment was terminated (other than as required by
COBRA) or has ever promised to provide such post-termination benefits. There
are no promised increases in benefits (whether expressed, implied, oral or
written) under any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Seller, nor are there
any obligations, commitments or understandings to continue any such Employee
Benefit Plans (whether expressed, implied, oral or written), except as
required by COBRA. Each Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Seller as of the
Closing Date is subject to termination by Seller without any further Liability
on the part of Seller to make further contributions to any such plan following
such termination, and the termination of any Employee Benefit Plan would not
accelerate or increase any benefits payable under such Employee Benefit Plan.
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (A) result in any payment to be made
by Seller (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment
compensation, golden parachute (defined in Section 280G of the Code), or
otherwise) becoming due to any employee, director or consultant, or (B)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Employee Benefit Plan.

(c) Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has been determined to be so qualified by the IRS and nothing has
occurred since the date of the last such determination which resulted or is
likely to result in the revocation of such determination. Full payment has
been made of all amounts which Seller is required, under applicable Law or
under any Employee Benefit Plan or any agreement relating to any Employee
Benefit Plan to which Seller is a party, to have paid as contributions thereto
as of the Closing Date. Seller has made adequate provision for reserves to
meet contributions that have not been made because they are not yet due under
the terms of any Employee Benefit Plan or related agreements. Benefits under
all Employee Benefit Plans are as represented and have not been increased
subsequent to the date as of which documents have been provided.

(d) There has not been any material failure of any party to comply with any
Law applicable to any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Seller. Seller has
not engaged in any material transaction with respect to the Employee Benefit
Plans which would subject Seller to a tax, penalty or Liability for prohibited
transactions under ERISA or the Code, or for any other reason, and none of its
directors, officers or employees to the extent they or any of them are
fiduciaries with respect to such plans, breached any of their responsibilities
or obligations imposed upon fiduciaries under Title I of ERISA or taken or
failed to take any action that would result in any claim being made under, by
or on behalf of any such plans by any party with standing to make such claim.
No litigation, claim, arbitration, governmental proceeding, audit, or
investigation or other proceeding (other than those relating to routine claims
for benefits) is pending or threatened with respect to any Employee Benefit
Plan.

(e) Seller has delivered or caused to be delivered to Buyer and its counsel
true and complete copies of (i) all Employee Benefit Plans as in effect for
Seller, together with all amendments thereto which will become effective at a
later date, as well as the latest IRS determination letter obtained with
respect to any such Employee Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401 or 501
of the Code, (ii) Form 5500 for the three (3) most recent completed fiscal
years for each Employee Benefit Plan required to file such form, (iii) a
current Summary Plan Description for each Employee Benefit Plan, together with
any summary of any modifications thereto, (iv) any insurance or annuity policy
(including any fiduciary liability insurance policy) related to any Employee
Benefit Plan, and (v) the three (3) most recent Summary Annual Reports
provided to participants for each Employee Benefit Plan.

(f) Seller and its ERISA Affiliates have materially complied with COBRA. 

(g) There is no pending or threatened action, claim or Proceeding relating to
any Employee Benefit Plan (other than Ordinary Course of Business claims for
benefits) that is, or could be or become a Liability of Buyer.

(h) Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate contributes to, ever has
contributed to, or ever has been required to contribute to any "employee
pension benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to
Title IV of ERISA, or any Multiemployer Plan or has any Liability (including
withdraw liability) relating thereto.

3.21 Certain Payments. Neither Seller nor any director, officer, agent or
employee of Seller, nor any other Person associated with or acting for or on
behalf of Seller, has directly or indirectly (a) made, offered or agreed to
offer any contribution, gift, bribe, rebate, payoff, influence payment,
kickback, or other payment to any Person, private or public, regardless of
form, whether in money, property, or services (i) to obtain favorable
treatment in securing business, (ii) to pay for favorable treatment for
business secured, (iii) to obtain special concessions or for special
concessions already obtained, for or in respect of Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller, or (iv) in violation of any Law, or (b) established or maintained any
fund or asset that has not been recorded in the books and records of Seller.



3.22 Broker's or Finder's Fees. Except for Camino Real Advisors, LLC, no
agent, broker, person or firm acting on behalf of the Seller Parties is, or
will be, entitled to any commission or broker's or finder's fees from any of
the parties hereto, or from any Affiliate of the parties hereto, in connection
with any of the Subject Transactions.



3.23 Licenses, Permits, Consents and Approvals. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.23(a), Seller has (except for the Required Consent), and at the
Closing Date will have, all Governmental Authorizations required to conduct
the business and operations of the Parks as currently conducted or for the
ownership and use of the Seller's Assets. All such Governmental Authorizations
are valid and in full force and effect. All fees and charges with respect to
such Governmental Authorizations as of the date hereof have been paid in full.
Schedule 3.23(b) lists all current Governmental Authorizations issued to
Seller which are related to the business or operation of the Parks as
currently conducted or the ownership and use of the Seller's Assets, including
the names of the Governmental Authorizations and their respective dates of
issuance and expiration. To the Knowledge of Seller Parties, no event has
occurred that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation, suspension, lapse or
limitation of any Governmental Authorization set forth in Schedule 3.23.

material in any form or condition; paint containing elevated levels of lead;

(iv) To the Knowledge of Seller Parties, the Subject Transactions do not
impose any obligations under Environmental and Safety Requirements for site
investigation or cleanup or notification to or consent of any Governmental
Body or third parties.

(v) No facts, events or conditions relating to past properties, the Real
Property or the business or operation of the Parks or properties contiguous
thereto will (A) materially prevent, hinder or limit continued compliance by

corrective, investigatory or remedial obligations on the part of Buyer
pursuant to Environmental and Safety Requirements, or (C) give rise to any
Environmental and Safety Liabilities. 

(vi) Seller has not assumed, whether by Contract or operation of Law, any
Liabilities or obligations of any third party under Environmental and Safety

satisfactory to Buyer and in each case conditioned upon the Closing: (a)
indicating the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all
Indebtedness as of the Closing Date (and the daily accrual thereafter) (the

6.06 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.



(a) For a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), the Restricted Persons, shall not, and shall not permit
any of their Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or assist
others in engaging in the Restricted Business in the Territory; (ii) have an
interest in any Person that engages directly or indirectly in the Restricted
Business in the Territory in any capacity, including as a partner,
shareholder, member, employee, principal, agent, trustee or consultant; or
(iii) cause, induce or encourage any material actual or prospective client,
customer, supplier or licensor of the Parks (including any existing or former
client or customer of Seller and any Person that becomes a client or customer
of Buyer or its Affiliates or the Parks after the Closing), or any other
Person who has a material business relationship with the Parks, to terminate
or modify any such actual or prospective relationship. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Restricted Person may own, directly or indirectly, solely as
an investment, securities of any Person traded on any national securities
exchange if such Restricted Person is not a controlling Person of, or a member
of a group which controls, such Person and does not, directly or indirectly,
own five percent (5%) or more of any class of securities of such Person.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.06, pursuant to the Family
Settlement Documents it is contemplated that the Restricted Persons will
retain their ownership in, and continue the operation of, the following
entities that own and operate the indoor waterpark located at the waterpark
commonly known as "Schlitterbahn South Padre Island" (the "Indoor South Padre
Waterpark"): (i) SPI Beach Resort Waterpark, LLC, (ii) Schlitterbahn Beach
Resort Management, LLC, and (iii) SPI BRWP Holdings, LLC, each a Texas limited
liability company (collectively, the "South Padre Entities"), and the parties

however, that the Restricted Persons shall not, through the South Padre
Entities or otherwise, expand the business of the Indoor South Padre
Waterpark, including, without limitation, through the acquisition of
additional real properties, assets or businesses that engage in the Restricted
Business.

(b) During the Restricted Period, each Restricted Person shall not, and shall
not permit any of their Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit
any Person who is offered employment by Buyer pursuant to Section 6.08 or is

the Restricted Period, or encourage any such employee to leave such employment
or hire any such employee who has left such employment, except pursuant to a
general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such employees.



(c) Each Restricted Person acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of
this Section 6.06 would give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer and its
Affiliates, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and
hereby agrees that in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by any
Restricted Person or their Affiliates of any such obligations, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that
may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable
relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific
performance and any other relief that may be available from a court of
competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).



(d) Each Restricted Person acknowledges that the restrictions contained in
this Section 6.06 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate
interests of Buyer and its Affiliates and constitute a material inducement to
Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Subject Transactions. In
the event that any covenant contained in this Section 6.06 should 

ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service or
other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any
court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall
be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic,
product or service or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The
covenants contained in this Section 6.06 and each provision hereof are
severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions
hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other
jurisdiction.

materials or its legal counsel. In addition, Buyer agrees to pull and refile
its initial filing under the HSR Act, pursuant to 16 C.F.R. § 803.12, if,

conditions of this Agreement.



6.08 Employees and Employee Benefits. 

(a) Effective immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall terminate all
employees of Seller set forth on Schedule 6.08 (the "Terminated Employees")
who are actively employed as of the Closing, and, at Buyer's sole discretion,
Buyer may offer employment, with employment effective immediately after the
Closing Date on an "at will" basis, to any or all of such employees (any

to Buyer; it being understood that any Liabilities arising out of the failure
of the Seller Parties to comply with the requirements and provisions of any
bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws of any jurisdiction which would not
otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities shall be treated as Excluded
Liabilities.

(a) The Seller Parties shall be liable for and covenant to pay pursuant to
this Section 6.10, and the Seller Parties jointly and severally agree to
indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against any and

attributable to taxable years or periods beginning after the Closing Date and,
with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date; provided, that Buyer shall not be liable for
any Taxes for which any Seller is liable under this Agreement. For purposes of
this Section 6.10, any Straddle Period shall be treated on a "closing of the
books" basis as two partial periods, one ending at the close of the Closing
Date and the other beginning on the day after Closing Date, except that Taxes
(such as property Taxes) imposed on a periodic basis shall be allocated on a
daily basis.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 6.10(a), any transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any

Return or other document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and Buyer shall

Section 6.10. Within a reasonable time prior to the payment of any said Tax,
the party paying such Tax shall give notice to the other party of 

the Tax payable and the portion which is the liability of each party, although
failure to do so will not relieve the other party from its liability
hereunder.

(e) All Tax Returns for any Straddle Period shall be prepared by Seller and
presented to Buyer for its comments no later than thirty (30) days before the
due date of such Tax Return. Seller shall consider in good faith any comments

Representative) and Buyer shall (and cause their respective Affiliates to):

is responsible for preparing and filing; (ii) cooperate fully in preparing for
any audits of, or disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns
or the Assets; (iii) make available to the other and to any taxing authority
as reasonably requested all information, records and documents relating to
Taxes or the Assets; (iv) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any
pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to Taxes or the
Assets for taxable periods for which the other may have a liability under this
Section 6.10; and (v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence
received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or
information request with respect to any such taxable period.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
obligations of the parties set forth in this Section 6.10 shall be
unconditional and absolute and shall remain in effect without limitation as to
time.

to obtain and bind the RandW Insurance Policy on the terms and conditions
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the Seller Parties. The Seller Parties
shall cooperate with Buyer's efforts and provide assistance as reasonably
requested by Buyer to obtain and bind the RandW Insurance Policy. Prior to the
Closing, the Seller Parties and Buyer shall cause to be paid, all costs and
expenses related to the RandW Insurance Policy, including the total premium,
underwriting costs, brokerage commissions, and other fees and expenses of such
policy. An amount equal to 50% of such premium, underwriting costs, brokerage
expenses, and other fees and expenses of such policy shall be the
responsibility of Buyer and the other 50% shall be responsibility of Seller
Parties and shall be deemed Transaction Expenses hereunder.

6.12 Real Estate Matters.

(a) Existing Title Policies. Each applicable Seller has provided Buyer with
copies of their existing title insurance policies issued by a title company
for the Owned Real Property.

(b) Title Insurance Policies. At Closing, Buyer may obtain a title insurance
policy or policies (and any available extended coverages and/or endorsements)
from the Title Company or any other title company selected by Buyer for the
Owned Real Property to be conveyed and transferred to Buyer under this
Agreement, and/or one leasehold policy for the Leased Real Property. The title
insurance policy or policies for the Owned Real Property and/or the Leased
Real Property will insure indefeasible title to each such Owned Real Property
and/or Leased Real Property subject to the standard exceptions to title. Buyer
shall be responsible for the cost of the base premium title insurance policy,
and for the costs of any extended coverage, any title endorsements requested
by Buyer, as well as the cost of any lender coverage.

(c) Conveyance of Title. At Closing, each applicable Seller will convey the
Owned Real Property pursuant to the special warranty deeds described in
Section 2.06(a)(iii). Each applicable Seller shall remove from title, at or
before Closing, all mortgages or deeds of trust or other security interest
secured by a lien on any Owned Real Property or any part thereof.

(d) Title or Survey Objections. Buyer shall have the right to order a title
search to be performed with regard to the Owned Real Property and Leased Real
Property, and to order a commitment for title insurance (each, a "Commitment,"
and together, the "Commitments") to be issued by the Title Company or any
other nationally recognized title insurance company with regard to all or part
of such Owned Real Properties and Leased Real Properties, all at Buyer's sole
cost and expense. No later than the later of (i) thirty (30) days after the
date of this Agreement, or (ii) thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Commitments (the "Title Objection Date") Buyer may deliver written notice to
the Sellers' Representative of any title or survey defect, lien, or other
matter set forth in the Commitment that encumbers or adversely affects any
such Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property that is reasonably
unacceptable to Buyer, together with complete copies of each of any title
report or Commitment, and all documents and instruments referred to therein.
If Buyer does not deliver such written notice to the Sellers' Representative
on or before the Title Objection Date, Buyer shall be deemed to waive any
right to object to such defects, shall accept title to the affected Owned Real
Property and/or Leased Real Property subject to such defects. If, on or before
the Title Objection Date, Buyer properly gives notice to the Sellers'
Representative of Buyer's objections, Sellers' Representative shall, within
ten (10) Business Days after receiving such notice, notify Buyer whether
Sellers' Representative will or will not attempt to cure such objections.
Failure by Sellers' Representative to deliver such notice shall be deemed the
Sellers' Representative's election not to cure any objections. 

(e) Buyer Notice. If Sellers' Representative elects (or is deemed to have
elected) not to attempt to cure such objections, Buyer shall be entitled, by
giving notice (the "Buyer Notice") to the Sellers' Representative within five
(5) Business Days after receiving such notice from Sellers' Representative (or
the date on which Sellers' Representative was deemed to have provided such
notice), to (x) proceed to Closing without any reduction in the Purchase
Price, (y) remove the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property with the
uncured material defect from this Agreement in which case the Closing shall
nevertheless proceed, except that the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
portion of the Purchase Price allocation attached hereto allocated to such
Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property, and such Owned Real Property or
Leased Real Property shall no longer be a part of the Real Property being
transferred hereunder, or (z) terminate this Agreement in which event the
parties shall have no further rights or obligations under this Agreement
except for those that specifically survive termination.

6.13 Accounts Receivables. From and after the Closing, if any Seller or any of
its Affiliates receives or collects any funds relating to any Accounts
Receivable or any other Assets, such Seller or its Affiliate shall remit such
funds to Buyer within five (5) Business Days after its receipt thereof. From
and after the Closing, if Buyer or its Affiliates receives or collects any
funds relating to any Excluded Asset, Buyer or its Affiliates shall remit any
such funds to Sellers' Representative within five (5) Business Days after its
receipt thereof.

6.14 Lot Splitting. Regarding the Owned Real Property located at 635 E. Torrey
(parcel number 48750) in New Braunfels, Texas, Buyer and the Seller Parties
agree that (i) the Seller Parties will transfer at Closing .974 acres of such
Owned Real Property (as described on Appendix 5 of the Family Settlement
Agreement included in the Family Settlement Documents) pursuant to the terms
of Section 7(b) of that Family Settlement Agreement; and (ii) the Seller
Parties (or a Person designated by the Seller Parties) shall transfer
ownership and title of the remaining portion of such Owned Real Property
(1.833 acres in aggregate) to Buyer (or controlled Affiliates designated by
Buyer) at Closing.

time, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and
the Seller Parties shall have delivered to Buyer a certificate to such effect,

Agreement, if, on the potential Closing Date, each of the conditions set forth
in Section 7.01 above has been satisfied or waived other than the condition
set forth in Section 7.01(i) (the "Delayed KC Closing Scenario"), Buyer shall
be obligated to consummate the Texas Transaction subject to the terms of this

6.08, 6.10 and 6.12 such terms shall, in respect of the Subject Transactions
applicable to the Kansas City Waterpark in the event of a Delayed KC Closing
Scenario, be deemed to refer, mutatis mutandis, to the KC Delayed Closing and
the date of the KC Delayed Closing, respectively. For the avoidance of doubt,

the Texas Transaction, the Seller Parties will not be in breach of Section
6.06 as the result of the Kansas City Sellers' ownership of the Kansas City
Waterpark;



(b) Whenever the term "Parks" is used in Sections 2.01 and 2.03 such term

ARTICLE IX

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, the Seller Parties jointly
and severally (other than with respect to the Galveston Sellers, whose
indemnification obligations hereunder shall be several and not joint and shall
be limited to Losses set forth in Section 9.01(c)) shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer, its Representatives and Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer
Group Members"), from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Buyer
Group Members arising from or in connection with:

(i) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation or
certification of a Seller contained or referred to in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other document delivered by or on behalf of a Seller pursuant

(ii) any breach by a Seller of any of its covenants or agreements, or any
failure of a Seller to perform any of its obligations, in this Agreement or in
any other Acquisition Document;

(iii) any Excluded Liability; or

(iv) any claim by any Person for broker's or finder's fees or commissions or
similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have

of a Seller) in connection with the Subject Transactions.

(b) The indemnification provided for in clause (i) of Section 9.01(a) shall
terminate on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (and
no claims shall be made by any Buyer Group Member under clause (i) of Section
9.01(a) thereafter), except that the indemnification by the Seller Parties
shall continue as to the representations and warranties set forth in (i)
Sections 3.01, 3.03, and 3.22 (the "Seller Fundamental Reps"), as to which no
time limitation shall apply, (ii) Section 3.24, until the date that is forty-
eight (48) months after the Closing Date, and (iii) Section 3.13, until sixty
(60) days following the expiration of the statute of limitations (taking into

Buyer Group Member has notified the Sellers' Representative of in accordance
with the requirements of Section 9.04 on or prior to the date such
indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance with this Section
9.01(b), shall continue until the liability of the Seller Parties shall have
been determined pursuant to this Article IX and the Seller Parties shall have
reimbursed all Buyer Group Members for the full amount of such Loss in

and the Assets used in the operation of the Galveston Waterpark, including,
without limitation, any Losses incurred by the Buyer Group Members pursuant to
Section 9.01(a) as a result of items (i)-(iii) of this Section 9.01(c). Except
to the extent of amounts held in the Indemnity Escrow Account, the Galveston
Sellers will have no responsibility to indemnify the Buyer Group Members for
Losses that arise from or relate to the representations made by the New
Braunfels Sellers or the Kansas City Sellers, Excluded Liabilities pertaining
to the New Braunfels Sellers or the Kansas City Sellers, the obligations of
the New Braunfels Sellers for other Losses that arise from or relate to the
New Braunfels Waterpark or the Assets used in the operation of the New
Braunfels Waterpark, or the obligations of the Kansas City Sellers for other
Losses that arise from or relate to the Kansas City Waterpark or the Assets
used in the operation of the Kansas City Waterpark.

9.02 Indemnification by Buyer.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Parties, their Representatives and Affiliates
(collectively, the "Seller Group Members") from and against any and all Losses

(i) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation or
certification of Buyer contained or referred to in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other document delivered by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to

similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have

Buyer) in connection with the Subject Transactions.

(b) The indemnification provided for in clause (i) of Section 9.02(a) shall
terminate on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (and
no claims shall be made by the Seller Parties under clause (i) of Section
9.02(a) thereafter), except that the indemnification by Buyer shall continue
as to Sections 4.01, 4.02, and 4.03 (the "Buyer Fundamental Reps"), as to
which no time limitation shall apply. All covenants and agreements of the
Buyer contained herein shall survive the Closing indefinitely or for the
period of time explicitly given to such covenant or agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any claims 

of which a Seller Group Member has notified Buyer in accordance with the
requirements of Section 9.04 on or prior to the date such indemnification
would otherwise terminate in accordance with this Section 9.02(b), shall
continue until the liability of Buyer shall have been determined pursuant to
this Article IX and Buyer shall have reimbursed all Seller Group Members for
the full amount of such Loss in accordance with this Article IX.

9.03 Certain Limitations.

(a) The indemnification provided for in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02, as
applicable, shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Section
9.03.

(b) Except for inaccuracies in the Seller Fundamental Reps, the Tax
representation and warranties set forth in Section 3.13 and claims arising
from fraud or willful misconduct, the Seller Parties shall not be liable to
any Buyer Group Member for indemnification under Section 9.01(a)(i), until the
aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section
9.01(a)(i) exceeds $1,335,000.00 (the "Deductible"), in which event the Seller
Parties shall only be required to pay or be liable for Losses in excess of the
Deductible. Except for inaccuracies in the Buyer Fundamental Reps and claims
arising from fraud or willful misconduct, the Buyer shall not be liable to any
Seller Group Member for indemnification under Section 9.02(a)(i) until the
aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section
9.02(a)(i) exceeds an amount equal to the Deductible, in which event the Buyer
shall only be required to pay or be liable for Losses in excess of the
Deductible.

(c) Except for inaccuracies in the Seller Fundamental Reps, the Tax
representation and warranties set forth in Section 3.13 and claims arising
from fraud or willful misconduct, the aggregate amount of all Losses for which
the Seller Parties shall be liable pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(i) shall not
exceed $1,335,000.00 (the "Cap"). Except for inaccuracies in the Buyer
Fundamental Reps and claims arising from fraud or willful misconduct, the
aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Buyer shall be liable pursuant to
Section 9.02(a)(i) shall not exceed the Cap.

(d) From and after the Closing, any Losses for which a Buyer Group Member is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(i) shall be satisfied:

(i) first, from the Indemnity Escrow Account, pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement; and

(ii) second, by recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy (with the RandW
Insurance Policy and the Indemnity Escrow Account serving as the Buyer Group
Members' sole and exclusive source of recovery for any Losses arising under
Section 9.01(a)(i), except for inaccuracies in any Seller Fundamental Reps,
the Tax representation and warranties set forth in Section 3.13 and claims
arising from fraud or willful misconduct).

(e) From and after the Closing, with respect to any Losses for which a Buyer
Group Member is entitled that arise from (i) an inaccuracy in the Seller
Fundamental Reps, (ii) an inaccuracy in the Tax representation and warranties
set forth in Section 3.13, (iii) fraud or willful misconduct of the Seller
Parties, or (iv) claims made pursuant to Sections 9.01(a)(ii)-(iv), Buyer
shall utilize the Indemnity Escrow Account as the first source of recovery and
then, to the extent the amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account is
insufficient, Buyer shall be able to recover all such Losses directly from the
applicable Seller Parties and such Losses shall not be subject to the
Deductible and Cap; provided, however, that if any funds in the Indemnity
Escrow Account are used as a source of recovery for any Losses for which a
Buyer Group Member is entitled (A) based on the fraud or willful misconduct of
the Seller Parties or (B) claims made pursuant to Sections 9.01(a)(ii)-(iv),
the applicable Seller Parties agree to replenish all funds taken from the
Indemnity Escrow Account for such purpose within five (5) Business Days from
the date of disbursement of such funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account.

(f) For purposes of this Article IX, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

(g) Payments by an Indemnitor pursuant to Section 9.01 or Section 9.02, as
applicable, in respect of any indemnifiable Loss shall be net of any insurance
recovery (after deducting therefrom the amount of any expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in procuring such recovery) actually received by the
Indemnified Party on account of such indemnifiable Loss from an unaffiliated
party. The Indemnified Party shall use its Best Efforts to recover under
insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for
any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

9.04 Notice of Claims. Any Buyer Group Member or Seller Group Member making a
claim for indemnification under this Article IX is referred to as the
"Indemnified Party", and the party against whom such claims are asserted under
this Article IX is referred to as the "Indemnitor". 

(a) Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder shall give to the
Indemnitor a notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include
in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of computation
of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of this
Agreement or any other Acquisition Document, agreement, document or instrument
executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based;
provided, that a Claim Notice in respect of any pending or threatened action
at Law or suit in equity by or against a third Person as to which
indemnification will be sought (each such action or suit being a "Third Person
Claim") shall be given reasonably promptly after the action or suit is
commenced, but in any event not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of,
or becoming aware of, such Third Party Claim; provided, further, that failure
to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent it shall have been materially prejudiced by
such failure.

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
Article IX shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of
any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor may agree. The judgment or decree of a
court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall
have been finally determined. Promptly after the determination of the amount
of indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.04(b), the Indemnitor shall
satisfy such amount in the manner provided in Section 9.03.

9.05 Third Person Claims. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise
or settlement of any Third Person Claim against such Indemnified Party as to
which indemnification will be sought by any Indemnified Party from any
Indemnitor hereunder, and in any such case the Indemnitor shall reasonably
cooperate in connection therewith and shall furnish such records, information
and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party in
connection therewith (excluding, for avoidance of doubt, any records,
information, testimony or materials that the Indemnitor reasonably believes
are subject to protection under the attorney-client privilege or work product
doctrine as it concerns the Indemnitor and its legal counsel); provided, that:
(i) the Indemnitor may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its
own expense, in the defense of any such Third Person Claim as to which the
Indemnified Party has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof;
and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not, without the written consent of the
Indemnitor (which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), pay, compromise or settle any such Third Person Claim.

9.06 Mitigation. Except with respect to Taxes, each party shall take, and
cause its Affiliates to take, commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any
Losses upon becoming aware of any event or circumstances that would reasonably
be expected to be subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX,
except that no party shall be required to commence any action, suit, claim or
proceeding against any Person even if it would otherwise be commercially
reasonable to do so.

9.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

9.08 Manner of Payment; Escrow.

(a) Within five (5) Business Days following the final determination of an
indemnification claim to which a Buyer Group Member is entitled pursuant to
this Article IX, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent, instructing the Escrow Agent to release
funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account to Buyer in the amount of such finally
determined claim.

(b) Promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days following the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date (and at any time thereafter
to the extent the funds then held by the Escrow Agent exceed the aggregate
amount claimed by Buyer pursuant to claims timely made prior to the twelve
(12) month anniversary of the Closing Date in accordance with this Article IX
and the Escrow Agreement, but that have not been finally determined), Buyer
and Sellers' Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute any remaining funds
held by the Escrow Agent (minus the aggregate amount claimed by Buyer pursuant
to claims timely made in accordance with this Article IX and the Escrow
Agreement, and not finally determined prior to such date) to Sellers'
Representative (for further distribution to the New Braunfels Sellers and the
Kansas City Sellers, as applicable) and to the Galveston Sellers pursuant to
the Allocation Notice and such wiring instructions provided by the Sellers'
Representative in joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent.

9.09 Exclusive Remedies. Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter
of Law and injunctive and provisional relief (including specific performance),
this Article IX and the provisions of Section 6.10 shall be the exclusive
remedy for breaches of this Agreement (including the breach of or inaccuracy
in any covenant, obligation, representation or warranty contained in this 

Agreement or in any certificate or other document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement); provided, however, that in the event of intentional fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful breach of the covenants or agreements
contained herein, by Buyer or any Seller, any Indemnified Party shall have all
remedies available at Law or in equity (including for tort) with respect
thereto. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives (on behalf
of itself and of its Affiliates), to the fullest extent permitted under Law,
any and all rights, claims and causes of action for any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation
set forth in this Agreement or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement that it may have against the other parties and their respective
Affiliates, based on any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article IX, Section 6.10, and as otherwise
expressly provided in the preceding sentence.

Transactions has not expired or otherwise been terminated within sixty (60)
days after the HSR Filing Date.

10.02 Effect of Termination. Each of the party's right of termination under
Section 10.01 is in addition to any other rights it may have under this
Agreement or otherwise, including, without limitation, its right to specific
performance under Section 11.09, and the exercise of such right of termination
will not be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 10.01, all obligations of the parties under this Agreement will
terminate, except that the obligations of the parties in Section 6.04, this
Article X, and Article XI will survive such termination; provided, however,
that if this Agreement is terminated 

pursuant to Section 10.01, nothing shall relieve either party from Losses
arising from or relating to (i) any breach of this Agreement by such party
occurring prior to such termination; or (ii) any inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty made by such party in this Agreement, and the
parties shall have the right to pursue all legal and equitable remedies with
respect thereto.

ARTICLE XI

MISCELLANEOUS



11.01 Assignment; Successors and Assigns. The rights of the parties under this
Agreement shall not be assignable and the performance obligations of the
parties under this Agreement may not be delegated, whether by transfer,
merger, operation of law, change of control or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of the other party; provided, however, that Buyer may assign
its rights to purchase the Assets and assume the Assumed Liabilities to one or
more of its controlled Affiliates, but no such assignment shall relieve it of
its performance obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and
permitted assigns. The successors and permitted assigns hereunder shall
include, in the case of Buyer, any permitted assignee as well as the
successors in interest to such permitted assignee (whether by merger,
liquidation (including successive mergers or liquidations) or otherwise).
Except as set forth in Article IX, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any Person other
than the parties and successors and assigns permitted by this Section 11.01
any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. Any
assignment of rights or delegation of performance obligations violating this
Agreement will be void.



11.02 Notices. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and
other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have
been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt);

overnight courier (receipt requested); (c) on the date sent by facsimile or

11.03 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to each of the Buyer and the Seller Parties. Delivery of
a facsimile copy of an executed signature page, or delivery via email of a PDF
or other electronic copy of an executed signature page to this Agreement shall
be as effective as manual delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

11.04 Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement, the Acquisition Documents,
the Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein and/or attached hereto contain
the sole and entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto with
regard to the subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all
prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency
between the statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the
Acquisition Documents, the Exhibits and Schedules (other than an exception
expressly set forth as such in the Schedules), the statements in the body of
this Agreement will control. This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or
supplemented except by a written instrument signed by Buyer and the Seller
Parties.



11.05 Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the
time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties entitled to
the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently
authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party, it is
authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right
of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of
any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other
or subsequent breach.



11.06 Partial Invalidity. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law,
but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder
of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other
provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.



11.07 Further Assurances. From time to time following the Closing, the Seller
Parties shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to
Buyer such other instruments of conveyance, assignment, and transfer and take
such other action as Buyer may reasonably request or as may be otherwise
necessary to more effectively convey, assign, and transfer to, and vest in,
Buyer and put Buyer in possession of, any part of the Assets, and, in the case
of Assigned Contracts, licenses, certificates, approvals, authorizations,
easements and other commitments included in the Assets.



11.08 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Service
of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement and each of the other Acquisition Documents (except to the
extent otherwise expressly set forth therein) shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal Laws (as opposed to the conflicts of
law provisions) of the State of Delaware. Except as otherwise expressly set
forth in any other Acquisition Documents and subject to the arbitration
provisions contained Section 2.08(b) with regard to the adjudication of
certain specified disputes by the Adjustment Arbitrator, by the execution and
delivery of this Agreement all parties hereto irrevocably and exclusively
submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in the State
of Delaware located in New Castle County in any suit or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or any other Acquisition Document (except to
the extent otherwise expressly set forth therein) and waive any and all
objections to such jurisdiction, including any claim or objection that such
court is in an inconvenient forum. This Agreement may be pleaded by any party
or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives as a full and
complete defense and may be used as the basis for an injunction against any
action, suit or proceeding instituted or maintained against it in violation of
this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in any other
Acquisition Document, each of the parties to this Agreement agree that notice
or the service of process in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any other Acquisition Document shall be properly
served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by Section 11.02. 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACQUISITION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
ACQUISITION DOCUMENTS OR THE SUBJECT TRANSACTION. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 11.08(b).

11.09 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting the preceding sentence, if
any party commits a breach, or threatens to commit a breach, of any of the
provisions of Section 5.03, 6.03 or 6.04, the other party or parties shall
have the right and remedy, in addition to any others, to have the provisions
of those respective sections, as the case may be, specifically enforced by any
court having equity jurisdiction, together with an accounting therefor, it
being acknowledged and understood by the parties that any such breach or
threatened breach of any of those provisions by the breaching party would
cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching party and that money damages
would not provide an adequate remedy therefor.

11.10 Expenses. Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, each party hereto
will pay all costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and preparation of
this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all agreements and
conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or complied with,
including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its Representatives.

11.11 Mutual Drafting. Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of
this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive arms-
length negotiations between the parties. In the event that any ambiguity or
question of intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption, burden of proof or rule requiring
construction or interpretation shall arise or be imposed favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. In addition, the other Acquisition Documents shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption, burden of
proof or rule requiring construction or interpretation shall arise or be
imposed favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
of the provisions of the Acquisition Documents.

11.12 Release.

(a) Subject to Section 11.12(c) below, effective for all purposes as of the
Closing, each Seller, on behalf of himself and his successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Releasing Parties"), hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably and forever releases and discharges Buyer, and its respective
Affiliates, and each of their respective successors and assigns, and any
present or former directors, managers, officers, employees or agents of such
Person (each, a "Released Party"), of and from, and hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waive, any and all claims, debts, losses, expenses, proceedings,
covenants, liabilities, suits, judgments, damages, actions and causes of
action, obligations, accounts, and liabilities of any kind or character
whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, in contract, direct or
indirect, at law or in equity that such party ever had or now has against any
Released Party, for or by reason of any matter, circumstance, event, action,
inaction, omission, cause or thing whatsoever in respect of (i) his, her or
its ownership of the Parks or the Assets prior to Closing, and (ii) any
Excluded Liabilities. Each Seller, on behalf of himself, herself or itself,
and his, her or its successors and assigns, expressly waives all rights
afforded by any statute which limits the effect of a release with respect to
unknown claims.

(b) The Seller Parties understand the significance of this release of unknown
claims and waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims,
and acknowledge and agree that this waiver is essential and material
consideration in exchange for Buyer's entry into this Agreement. The Seller
Parties acknowledge that Buyer will be relying on the waiver and release
provided in this Section 11.12 in connection with entering into this
Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (i) nothing
contained in this Section 11.12 shall release any Released Party from its
respective obligations and liabilities under this Agreement or any Acquisition
Document or constitute a waiver of any claims that a Seller may bring or have
to enforce any provision of this Agreement or any Acquisition Document, and
(ii) this release shall only relate to those claims arising from conduct
occurring on or before the Closing or any agreement in effect on or before the
Closing (other than any agreement entered into in order to effectuate this
Agreement).

11.13 Sellers' Representative. 

(a) At the Closing, without further act of any Seller, the Sellers'
Representative is hereby irrevocably appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact
(with full power of substitution for each Seller) for and on behalf of the
Seller Parties, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
delivery to any Indemnified Party of cash in satisfaction of claims to any
Indemnified Party for any breach of a representation or warranty in Article
III of this Agreement or breach of covenant or agreement to be performed by
the Seller Parties contained in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to
Closing (a "Buyer Claim"); (i) to object to such deliveries, to retain and
appoint advisors and to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to negotiate and execute
any waivers or amendments of this Agreement (provided that any such waiver or
amendment that is materially and disproportionately adverse to any Seller
shall also require the written consent of such Seller, as applicable), (ii) to
take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers'
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing and in the defense of
any Buyer Claim and any adjustment to the Purchase Price to be made pursuant
to Section 2.08 of this Agreement, and (iii) to take all other actions which
under this Agreement may be taken by the Sellers' Representative and to do or
refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of such Seller which
Sellers' Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion
relating to the Subject Transactions as fully and completely as such Seller
could do if personally present. The Sellers' Representative may resign from
such position at any time upon written notice to Buyer, and shall appoint a
replacement Sellers' Representative on written notice to Buyer. In the event
that the Sellers' Representative does not appoint a replacement within thirty
(30) days of such resignation, the position of Sellers' Representative may be
filled by approval of the Sellers. No bond shall be required of the Sellers'
Representative, and the Sellers' Representative shall not receive compensation
for its services. Notices or communications to or from the Sellers'
Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the Sellers. The
death or incapacity of any Seller shall not terminate the agency and power of
attorney granted hereby to the Sellers' Representative.

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers' Representative
shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all the Seller
Parties, with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 11.13 and shall
be final, binding upon and conclusive with respect to each of such Seller, and
Buyer may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Sellers' Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
each and every Seller. Buyer is hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by it in accordance with such decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Sellers' Representative. Buyer shall be entitled to
disregard any decisions or communications or writing made, given or executed
by any Seller in connection with this Agreement unless the same is made, given
or executed by the Sellers' Representative in its capacity as such, and shall
be entitled to deal exclusively with the Sellers' Representative on all
matters relating to this Agreement.

(c) All reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including fees payable to
counsel, accountants and other professional fees) incurred by the Sellers'
Representative in connection with performing such function and in connection
with the Subject Transactions and all payments, damages, costs, fees and
expenses in connection with any dispute between the Sellers' Representative
and the Seller Parties under this Agreement shall be paid by the Seller
Parties.

11.14 Third Party Consents. To the extent that Seller's rights under any
Assigned Contract or Governmental Authorization constituting an Asset, or any
other Asset, may not be assigned to Buyer without the consent of another
Person which has not been obtained, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a
breach thereof or be unlawful, and the Seller Parties, at their expense, shall
use their Best Efforts to obtain any such consents; provided, however, that
nothing in this Agreement will require any of the Seller Parties to pay any
amounts or other consideration to such Persons in exchange for the provision
of such consents. If any such consent is not obtained or if any attempted
assignment would be ineffective or would impair Buyer's rights under the Asset
in question so that Buyer would not in effect acquire the benefit of all such
rights, the Seller Parties, to the maximum extent permitted by Law and the
Asset, shall act after the Closing as Buyer's agent in order to obtain for it
the benefits thereunder and shall cooperate, to the maximum extent permitted
by Law and the Asset, with Buyer in any other reasonable arrangement designed
to provide such benefits to Buyer. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Section 11.14 to the contrary, Buyer shall not be deemed to have waived its
rights under Section 6.07(a) or Article VII unless and until Buyer either
provides written waivers thereof or elects to proceed to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at Closing.
