event within three (3) Business Days, after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a share of Common
Stock converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(i)_, (A) a letter of
transmittal in the Paying Agents standard form (and reasonably satisfactory
to Parent and the Company), specifying that delivery shall be effected, and

delivery of Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying
Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures
set forth in the letter of transmittal and (B) instructions for surrendering
such Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
in exchange for the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares
evidenced by such Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-

be entitled to receive, and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay in exchange
therefor, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares
formerly evidenced by that Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or such Book-Entry

 



5

    

 Share less any required withholding of Taxes. Any Certificates (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be
canceled immediately. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any amount
payable upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(iii) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, then the Merger Consideration
may be paid to such a transferee so long as (A) the surrendered Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share is accompanied by
all documents reasonably required by Parent to evidence and effect that
transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment (x) pays any applicable
transfer Taxes or other Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares or (y) establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent and the Paying Agent that all such transfer Taxes have already been
paid or are not applicable.

(iv) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_, each Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration, subject to the Surviving Corporations obligation to
pay any dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time which may have been authorized by the Company and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Share and, in the case of a Certificate, the shares of Common
Stock formerly represented by it.

 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the execution and delivery
by such Person of a customary indemnity agreement to provide indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration to such
Person in respect of the shares of Common Stock represented by such
Certificate.

 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(f) _Required Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as they are

 



6

    

 required to deduct or withhold therefrom under the Code, or any applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so
deducted and withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing authorities, those
amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom
such deduction or withholding was made for all purposes under this Agreement.

 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Payment Fund as directed by Parent; provided, that such investment shall be
in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of

Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual funds
investing solely in such assets and, in any such case, no such instrument
shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. Any such investment shall
be for the benefit, and at the risk, of Parent, and any interest or other
income resulting from such investment shall be for the benefit of Parent;
provided, that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
Merger Consideration payable hereunder and Parent shall promptly provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide, additional funds to
the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common Stock, Company
Options and Company Stock Awards immediately prior to the Effective Time in
the amount of any such losses to the extent necessary to satisfy the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Article II_.

 

(i) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to
Parent upon demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who has not complied with this _Article II_ shall look only to Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation, which shall remain responsible for payment
of the applicable Merger Consideration.

 

2.3 _Company Options and Company Stock Awards_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof by Parent

Option_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not then vested or exercisable, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that
Company Option, shall be canceled and each 

 



7

    

 Company Option shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent or
the Surviving Corporation promptly following the Effective Time an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the Option Consideration (as defined below)
multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be
acquired upon exercise of such Company Option. The Company Board or the
compensation committee thereof shall take all necessary and
appropriate actions so that all Company Options shall be vested in full as of

Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled without any payment
being made in respect thereof.

(b) Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof by Parent
and the applicable holder thereof or as otherwise provided below, each share
of restricted Common Stock that vests solely based on continued service (each,
a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company Restricted Stock Award,
shall be, at the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive from
Parent or the Surviving Corporation the Merger Consideration per share in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_.

 

(c) Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof by Parent
and the applicable holder thereof or as otherwise provided below, each share

goals (each, a " _Company Performance Stock Award_ ") outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company Performance
Stock Award, shall be, at the Effective Time, converted into the right to
receive a cash award determined by multiplying the Merger Consideration by
the number of shares of Common Stock that would vest based on the achievement
of any applicable performance goals at the target level.

 

(d) Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof by Parent
and the applicable holder thereof or as otherwise provided below, each award
of restricted stock units payable in shares of Common Stock or whose value is
determined with reference to the value of shares of Common Stock (" _Company
RSU Awards_ " and collectively with the Company Restricted Stock Awards and
Company Performance Stock Awards, the " _Company Stock Awards_ ") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company
RSU Award, shall be, at the Effective Time, converted into the right to
receive a cash award determined by multiplying the Merger Consideration by the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to each Company RSU Award. The
Company Board or the compensation committee thereof shall take all necessary
and appropriate actions so that all Company Stock Awards shall be fully vested
and all restricted periods shall lapse thereon in full as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

shall take all necessary and appropriate actions so that all Company Options,
as well as all Company RSU Awards, shall be canceled and the Company Equity

holder of any Company Option or any Company Stock Award will have any right to
acquire any equity securities of the Company, its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation as a result of such holders Company Options or Company
Stock Awards.

(f) Not later than ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall mail to each holder of Company Options and Company Stock Awards a letter
describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Options or Company
Stock Awards pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and providing instructions
for use in obtaining payment for such Company Options or Company Stock Awards
(which instructions shall provide that the cash payable to such holder of
Company Options or Company Stock Awards pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
2.3_ will be made by check or wire transfer in accordance with the holders
instructions on file with the Company in respect of payroll and, if no such
instructions are applicable to such holder, may be, at the election of such
holder, mailed to such holder or transferred to such holder by wire transfer).

 

(g) At the first regularly scheduled payroll payment date after Closing,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause its payroll agent to mail a check (or
transfer by wire transfer) to each applicable holder of a Company Option or
Company Stock Award, in such amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ in respect of such Company Option or Company Stock
Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the payments contemplated by
the immediately preceding sentence, Parent and the Surviving Corporation may
direct the Paying Agent to pay the Surviving Corporation (or its designees)
for (but only to the extent of) any amounts the Surviving Corporation elects
to pay to each holder of a Company Option or Company Stock Award in respect of
the consideration payable therefor plus any amounts deducted and withheld
with respect to any such amounts; in this event, Parent and Surviving
Corporation will provide the necessary funds to the Paying Agent to effectuate
the payment to holders of such Company Options or Company Stock Awards.

prior to the Effective Time; and (v) the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan
shall be suspended on January 28, 2020 and terminate effective as of the
Effective Time.

 

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_), any shares of
Common Stock for which the holder thereof (i) has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented to it in writing and (ii) has demanded the appraisal of
such shares in accordance with, and has complied in all respects with, the
FBCA (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with  _Section_
__ _ 2.1(c)_. At the Effective Time, (A) all Dissenting Shares shall be
canceled and cease to exist and (B) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled only to such rights as may be granted to them under the FBCA.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_, if
any holder of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal
rights (through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then
that holders shares (i) shall be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares
and (ii) shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) formerly
representing such shares or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence
to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, in each case in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Common Stock, any withdrawals of such demands and
any other instrument served on the Company under the FBCA and (ii) the right
to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for
appraisal. Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall

appraisal or otherwise settle any such demands without the prior written
consent of Parent.

31

    

 contributions to Parent under the Debt Financing (whether expressed in terms
of minimum value or percentage of shares), pursuant to which, and subject to
the terms and conditions of which, the Rollover Investors have committed to
contribute to Parent the amount of shares of Common Stock set forth therein
(the " _Rollover Investment_ "), and (y) a schedule setting forth each
Rollover Investor, the number of shares of the Company beneficially owned by
and over which such Rollover Investor holds sole voting and dispositive power,
and an indication of whether such shares of the Company are held directly or
indirectly by such Rollover Investor, and (ii) executed debt commitment
letters and related term sheets from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the " _ABL Commitment Letter_ ") and Pathlight Capital LP (the " _TL
Commitment Letter_ " and together with the ABL Commitment Letter, the " _Debt
Commitment Letters_ " or the " _Financing Commitments_ ") (Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association and Pathlight Capital LP, the " _Lenders_ ") pursuant to
which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Lenders have
committed to provide Parent and/or Merger Sub with financing in the amounts
described therein, the proceeds of which may be used to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt
Financing_ " or the " _Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, each of the
Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letters is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent or Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of the Parent, the
other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date hereof, each of the Financing
Commitments and the Rollover Letters is in full force and effect, and none of
the Financing Commitments or the Rollover Letters has been withdrawn,
rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. As of
the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Parent, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub is in breach of any of the material terms or conditions set forth in any
of the Financing Commitments or the Rollover Letters. As of the date hereof,
to the Knowledge of Parent with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
there is no fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (A)
make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the
Financing Commitments or the Rollover Letters inaccurate, (B) result in any of
the conditions in the Financing Commitments or the Rollover Letters not being
satisfied, (C) cause any of the Financing Commitments or the Rollover Letters
to be ineffective or (D) otherwise result in the Financing not being
available, or the Rollover Investment not being made, in each case, on a
timely basis in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As of the date hereof, neither the Rollover Investors nor any
Lender has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate any
Financing Commitment or not to provide the Financing, and none of the Rollover
Investors has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate any
Rollover Letter or not to make the Rollover Investment. Parent has not,
without the prior written consent of the Company, amended, modified,
supplemented or waived any of the conditions or contingencies to funding
contained in any Financing Commitment (including definitive agreements related
thereto) or to the Rollover Investment contained in any Rollover Letter, or
any other provision of, or remedies under, any Financing Commitment
(including definitive agreements related thereto) or any Rollover Letter
(except for any increases in the amount of funds available thereunder

 



32

    

 or the addition of Financing Sources in accordance with the terms thereof,
or other relevant entities who did not execute a Financing Commitment or a
Rollover Letter as of the date of this Agreement or as otherwise expressly
permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_). Assuming (1) the Financing is funded
in accordance with its terms and conditions, (2) the Rollover Investment is
made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Rollover Letters and
(3) the satisfaction of the conditions to the Companys obligation to
consummate the Merger set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, the net proceeds
from the Financing will, together with the Rollover Investment and other
funds available to Parent, be sufficient to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger Consideration, any fees and expenses of
or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and any related
repayment or refinancing of any indebtedness of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent or
Merger Sub has paid in full any and all commitment or other fees required by
any Financing Commitment that are due as of the date hereof, and will pay,
after the date hereof, all such commitments and fees as they become due.
There are no side letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements
relating to the Financing (except for customary fee letters and engagement
letters which do not contain any additional conditions to closing or other
agreements relating to the availability of the full amount of the Financing,
and a complete copy of the fee letter has been made available to the Company
with customary redactions of fee amounts, pricing caps, "market flex," other
economic terms and certain other terms, none of which redacted provisions
would adversely affect the conditionality or aggregate principal amount of the
Financing) or the Rollover Investment to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates are a party that relate to the amount,
availability or conditions of the Financing or the Rollover Investment, other
than the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letters. There are no
conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as explicitly set forth in the Financing Commitments,
and there are no conditions precedent related to the contribution of the full
amount of the Rollover Investment, other than as explicitly set forth in the
Rollover Letters. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to the Companys
obligation to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a reasonably timely basis any conditions to the funding
of the full amount of the Financing or the contribution of the full amount of
the Rollover Investment, or that the Financing will not be available to, or
that the Rollover Investment will not be contributed to, Parent or Merger Sub
on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to
Closing under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the Merger,
for Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing, the Rollover Investment or
any alternative financing.

 

(b) Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates has entered into
any Contract, arrangement or understanding with any bank or investment bank
or other potential provider of debt or equity financing that would prevent or
hinder such provider from providing or seeking to provide such financing to
any third party in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or
its Subsidiaries

 



33

    

 (including in connection with the making of any Takeover Proposal), in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii), in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor
any of their Affiliates has caused or induced any Person to take any action
that, if taken by Parent and/or Merger Sub, would be a breach of, or would
cause to be untrue, any of the representations in this  _Section_ __ _
4.6(b)_.

4.7 _Solvency_. On and as of the Closing Date, and after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing and
any alternative financing (including any financing to be issued or incurred in
lieu of any bridge facility in any Debt Commitment Letter) permitted by
this Agreement, the payment of the Merger Consideration, the incurrence of
indebtedness in connection with the Debt Financing, and the repayment or
refinancing of debt as contemplated herein and in the Financing Commitments,
and assuming (i) the Company is Solvent immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, or the waiver of
such conditions and (iii) the satisfaction of the conditions to the Companys
obligation to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporations
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be Solvent.

4.8 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Legal
Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against
Parent or any of its Affiliates before any Governmental Authority that would
or seeks to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates is subject to any Order

Material Contract. In the event that the Company does not provide access or

destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (and all analysis and other materials prepared by or on behalf of
such Person that contain any such information). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that if any Representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, acting on their behalf, takes any action that would

solely to clarify the terms of such Takeover Proposal and (ii) with respect to
a written, bona fide Takeover Proposal that did not result from any breach in

faith, (A) after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial
advisors, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take the actions set forth in

inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, then the Company may, in response to

respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the Person who has made
such Takeover Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, so
long as any written material non-public information provided under

Parent substantially concurrently with being provided to such Person, and (y)
participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Special
Committee and the Company Board shall be permitted (but only upon the express
written request of the counterparty), to the extent it determines in good
faith, after consultation with 

 



42

    

 outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, to modify, waive, amend or release any
existing standstill obligations owed by any Person to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries only to the extent necessary to allow a confidential Takeover
Proposal to be made to the Special Committee or the Company Board; provided
that the Company promptly notifies Parent of any such modification, waiver,
amendment or release.

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company shall
advise Parent orally and in writing within 24 hours of the receipt of any (x)
Takeover Proposal, (y) any written requests, inquiries, proposals or offers

such Takeover Proposal and including copies of any written documents or
material correspondence delivered in connection therewith, and (ii) the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis with respect
to the status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal and shall

receipt thereof.

(d) Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_ and _Section_ __ _

modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in any manner adverse to
Parent, or publicly propose to do so, (ii) approve, endorse, find advisable
or recommend a Takeover Proposal or publicly propose to do so or (iii)
approve, recommend or allow the Company to enter into a Contract relating to a
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

(e) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_, the Special Committee or the
Company Board may, at any time before obtaining the Requisite Company Vote and
in response to a Superior Proposal received by the Special Committee or the
Company Board after the date of this Agreement, if the Special Committee or
the Company Board has concluded in good faith, (A) following consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that its failure to withdraw, modify or amend the
Company Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to shareholders under applicable Law, and (B) after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or terminate this Agreement to
enter into a Contract, in accordance with Article VII with respect to such
Superior Proposal, but only if:

 

(i) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_;

(ii) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent
that it is prepared to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Contract with
respect to such

 



43

    

 Superior Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms and
conditions of the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal, and to the extent
provided to the Company, a copy of any material Contract evidencing or
relating to the Superior Proposal; and

 

(iii) Parent does not make, within five (5) Business Days after the receipt
of such notice, a proposal that the Special Committee or the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor,
causes the Takeover Proposal that constituted a Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , that the Company (acting
through the Special Committee) shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) during such period with respect to such proposal to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Superior
Proposal described in such notice ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
before obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if any event, fact, development,
circumstance or occurrence (but specifically excluding any Takeover Proposal
or Superior Proposal) that materially improves the business, assets,
operations or prospects of the Company or its Subsidiaries that was not known
(and should not reasonably have been known) to the Special Committee and the
Company Board as of the date hereof, becomes known to the Special Committee
and the Company Board after the date of this Agreement (an " _Intervening
Event_ ") (provided, that in no event shall the following constitute, or be
taken into account in determining the existence of, an Intervening Event: (A)
the fact alone that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or published
budgets, plan, forecasts or projections for any period, or (B) any changes
alone after the date of this Agreement in the market price or trading volume
of Company Common Stock) and the Special Committee or the Company Board has
concluded in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that its failure to withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to shareholders
under applicable Law, then the Company Board may withdraw, modify or amend
the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent but only if:

 

(i) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent
that the Special Committee or the Company Board intends to withdraw, modify
or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, which
notice shall include a description in reasonable detail of the Intervening
Event and the Company Boards reasons for taking such action; and

(ii) Parent does not, within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of
such notice, propose revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
in response to such Intervening Event that the Special Committee or the
Company Board determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, obviate the need for the Special Committee or the
Company Board to withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation,
and the Company (acting through the Special Committee) shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) during such period with respect to such proposed
revisions.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required
disclosure to the Companys shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Special Committee or the Company Board, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise
required under applicable Law; _provided_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(g)_
shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to (or the Special Committee
to recommend that the Company Board) take any action prohibited by _Section_
__ _ 5.4(d)_ except to the extent permitted by _Sections 5.4(e) - 5.4(f)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the issuance of a "stop, look
and listen" statement (or other similar statement pursuant to any requirement
of applicable Law) in and of itself constitute a change, withdrawal,
modification or amendment of the Company Board Recommendation under this
Agreement.

or filed with the SEC, as applicable, or at the time of any amendment or
supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they

made by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein to the extent based on information supplied by or on behalf
of Parent or Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement or the Schedule
13E-3 for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. The Company agrees
that the Company Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 will comply in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub hereby covenant and agree that none of the
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any Affiliate
of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the

(e) Following the clearance of the Company Proxy Statement and
Schedule 13E-3 by the SEC, the Company shall call and hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote.
Subject to

 



46

    

  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit or cause to be solicited from its shareholders proxies in favor of
adoption of this Agreement;  _provided_ , that the Company (after
consultation with Parent) may postpone, recess or adjourn the Company
Shareholders Meeting: (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of
a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board
has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) is necessary or advisable under applicable Laws and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the
Companys shareholders prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting (iv) to allow
additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Requisite
Company Vote, or (v) if the Company has provided a written notice to Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.4(f)(i)_ and the
latest deadline contemplated by Section 5.4(e)5.4(e) or 5.4(f) with respect
to such notice, as the case may be, has not been reached.

5.6 _Employees; Benefit Plans_. 

(a) Until the end of the current plan year for any Company Benefit Plan
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries to, provide to individuals who, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, were employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and, subject to Section 5.6(e) below, continue to be
employees of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") benefits under Company Benefit Plans (but not
including equity and equity-based awards or plans) that for such individual
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to such benefits being provided
to Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates to, honor all contracts with employees related to
severance, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be
permitted by Parent and except as provided herein; _provided_ , that nothing
herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any specific plan,
program policy, agreement or arrangement, or interfere with Parents, the
Surviving Corporations or any of their respective Affiliates rights or
obligations to make such changes, in each case as are necessary to comply
with applicable Law.

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to, recognize,
without duplication, credit for purposes or vesting, eligibility to
participate and for calculating severance and vacation entitlements (which
shall, for the avoidance of doubt, exclude benefit accruals under any
qualified or non-qualified defined benefit pension plan) for each such
Employees years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their
predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time (" _Prior Service_ ") (to
the extent the Company recognized such service for corresponding benefits)
under any employee compensation, incentive and benefit (including vacation and
severance) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the
benefit of Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation

 



47

    

 (each, a " _Parent Plan_ "). With respect to each Parent Plan that is a
"welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause there
to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations (to the
extent waived, satisfied or inapplicable under the corresponding plan
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time) and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and
maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by,
and amounts reimbursed to, Employees under similar plans maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time to which any
Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy or individual agreement
or other arrangement applicable to such Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Affiliates to, allow such Employee to use such accrued
vacation pursuant to the terms of Parents or the Surviving Corporations
vacation policy, as in effect from time to time.

 

(e) Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 8.11_, nothing in this  _Section_ __
_ 5.6_, whether express or implied, shall: (i) confer upon any current or
former employee of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates (including any Employee), any rights or remedies
including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section_
__ _ 5.6_, or restrict the ability of Parent, Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to terminate the employment or
service of any Person; (ii) be construed to modify, amend or create any
employee benefit plan of the Company, Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates, (iii) limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
Contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them; or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary
rights or obligations in any Person (including any Employee) other than the
parties to this Agreement. 

5.7 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six years commencing at the Effective Time (provided,
that such period shall be extended with respect to all unresolved claims for
indemnification by any Indemnified Party as of the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such claims are finally resolved), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause all rights to indemnification, advancement
of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor of any present or former
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the
fiduciaries of any Company Employee Benefits (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
as provided in (i) the Organizational Documents of the Company, or (ii)
agreements between an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries to survive the Merger and to continue in full force and effect
for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time or, if
longer, for such period

 



48

    

 as is set forth in any applicable agreement with an Indemnified Party in
effect on the date of this Agreement. In addition, for a period of six years
commencing at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause the Organizational Documents
of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that are
at least as favorable as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation provisions set forth in the Organizational Documents of the
Company as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) For a period of six years commencing at the Effective Time ( _provided_
that if any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Party delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_, then such period
shall be extended with respect to the claim asserted in such notice until
such claims are finally resolved), the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless all
Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law with
respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or relating to their services
as directors or officers of the Company, its Subsidiaries or another Person,
if such Indemnified Party is or was serving as a director, officer or
employee of such other Person at the request of the Company, or fiduciaries of
Company Employee Benefits, whether asserted or claimed at, after or before the
Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise). If any Indemnified Party is or becomes involved
in any Legal Action in connection with any matter subject to indemnification
hereunder, then the Surviving Corporation shall advance as incurred any costs
or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or Liabilities (" _Damages_ ") arising out of
or incurred in connection with such Legal Action, subject to the Surviving
Corporations receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Party to repay such Damages if it is ultimately determined under applicable
Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. In the
event of any such Legal Action, (i) each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Legal Action and (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Legal Action
pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and
in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Legal Action.

 

(c) If the Company has not purchased a "tail" policy in compliance with the
last sentence of this Section 5.7(c), Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain in effect for at least six years commencing at the
Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company or policies of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous
with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred
before or at the Effective Time (including in 

 



49

    

 connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) so long as
Parent and the Surviving Corporation are not required to pay a premium in
excess of 250% of the renewal premium paid or payable by the Company in
connection with its most recent renewal (such 250% amount being the " _Maximum
Premium_ "). If Parent and the Surviving Corporation are unable to obtain the
insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to
the Maximum Premium, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly
and severally, instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
lieu of the arrangements contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(c)_, before
the Effective Time, the Company shall be entitled to purchase, and at the
written request of Parent shall purchase, a "tail" directors and officers
liability insurance policy covering the matters described in this _Section_ __
_ 5.7(c)_ and, if the Company purchases such a policy before the Effective
Time, then Parent and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(c)_ shall be satisfied so long as Parent and the Surviving
Corporation cause such policy to be maintained in effect for a period of six
years following the Effective Time, provided that the cost of such policy may
not exceed the Maximum Premium.

 

(d) The covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action so that
the successors or assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.7_.

5.8 _Efforts_. Unless otherwise indicated by the terms hereof and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
applicable Law, each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done and assist and cooperate
with the other parties hereto in doing (or causing to be done), all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including by (a) causing the
conditions of the Merger set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied; (b) (1)
obtaining all consents, waivers, approvals, orders and authorizations from
Governmental Authorities, and (2) making all registrations, declarations and
filings with Governmental Authorities, in each case, that are necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (c) obtaining
all consents, waivers and approvals and delivering all notifications pursuant
to any Material Contracts (or, if reasonably requested by Parent, other
Contracts) in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger; and 

 



50

    

 (d) executing and delivering any Contracts and other instruments that are in
each case reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger prior to the Effective
Time, in no event shall the Company or its Subsidiaries be required to pay,
or otherwise incur any Liability, nor shall it so pay or incur without
Parents prior written consent, with respect to, any fees (except for
customary fees to Governmental Authorities), penalties, material conditions
or obligations, including amendments to existing material conditions, or other
consideration to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, agree to any of the foregoing
payments, security, conditions or obligations if requested by Parent and
effective only upon the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ shall not limit the rights
of the Company set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.4_.

 

5.9 _Consents; Filings; Further Action; Notices_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall, and
Parent shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly (i) obtain any consents, approvals or other
authorizations, and make any filings and notifications, required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) make any
other submissions either required or deemed appropriate by either Parent or
the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the FBCA, the
Applicable Exchange rules and regulations and any other applicable Law and
(iii) take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or
advisable consistent with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ to cause the expiration
of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required consents, approvals
or authorizations, as applicable, under such Laws as soon as reasonably
practicable. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all such filings and notifications,
including by providing copies of all relevant documents to the non-filing
party and its advisors before filing. No party shall consent to any voluntary
extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary
delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other
parties to this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, promptly inform the other party upon receipt of any material or
substantive communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent or the Company (or any
of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional information
from any Governmental Authority that is related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall endeavor in good faith
to make, or cause to be made, to the extent practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response to such request.
No party shall, or shall permit any of its Affiliates to, participate in any
meeting or engage in any material or substantive conversation with any
Governmental Authority without giving the other party prior notice of the
meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority,
the

 



51

    

 opportunity to attend or participate. Parent shall advise the Company
promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written)
which Parent or any of its Affiliates proposes to make or enter into with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition
or trade regulatory Law as promptly as practicable.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
shall take, and shall cause its Affiliates to take (and, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_, the Company and its Affiliates shall be permitted to
take, without affecting any representation, warranty, covenant or condition
in this Agreement), all action necessary to avoid the entry or to effect the
dissolution of, or vacate or lift, any Order which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing impairing or delaying the Closing, including (i)
selling, licensing, divesting or disposing of or holding separate any
entities, assets, Intellectual Property or businesses (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), (ii)
terminating, amending or assigning existing relationships or contractual
rights and obligations, (iii) changing or modifying any course of conduct
regarding future operations, (iv) otherwise taking actions that would limit
its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more
of their respective businesses, assets or rights or interests therein and (v)
committing to take any such actions in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii)
or (iv) (all of the foregoing a " _Divestiture Action_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither Parent nor its Affiliates shall be required to, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, take or agree to take or commit to take any Divestiture Action.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required
to, take any action with respect to any Order or any applicable Law which
would bind the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or in
the event the Merger does not occur.

 

5.10 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release concerning this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press
release to be reasonably agreed upon by the Company and Parent. Following such
initial press release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
(including any general communications to employees, customers, partners or
vendors) about this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither Parent nor the Company shall issue any such press release
or make any such public statement without prior consent of the other, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except (i)
to the extent required by applicable Law or Order or the applicable rules of
the Applicable Exchange, Parent or the Company may issue such a press release
or make such a statement if it has used its reasonable efforts to consult with
the other party before issuing any such press release or making any such
public statement but has been unable to do so prior to the time such press
release or public statement is so required to be issued or made and (ii) that
each party may, without complying with the foregoing obligations, may make
internal announcements to 

 



52

    

 employees, to the extent that such statements are not inconsistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
or individually by the parties and otherwise in compliance with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_ and do not reveal material non-public information
regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , that Parents consent shall not be required, and the Company
shall not be required to consult with Parent in connection with, or provide
Parent an opportunity to review or comment upon, any press release or other
public statement or comment to be issued or made with respect to any Takeover
Proposal or with respect to any actions contemplated by _Section_ __ _
5.4(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.4(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.4(g)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior consent of the other
parties, (a) the Company may communicate with customers, vendors, suppliers,
financial analysts, investors and media representatives in a manner consistent
with its past practice in compliance with applicable Law, (b) may disseminate
the information included in a press release or other document previously

Agreement.

otherwise in this Agreement, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all

registration, value added, transfer, stamp, recording and similar
Taxes, fees, and costs together with any interest thereon, penalties, fines,
costs, fees, additions to Tax or additional amounts with respect thereto
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (" _Conveyance Taxes_ "), shall be paid by Parent, and Parent shall
file all Tax Returns related thereto, regardless of who may be liable therefor
under applicable Law.

 

5.12 _Financing Efforts_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Financing as soon as reasonably practicable on the terms and conditions
contained in the Financing Commitments and to consummate the Rollover
Investment pursuant to the Rollover Letters in accordance with the
terms thereof, including using its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
comply with its obligations under the Financing Commitments and the Rollover
Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to
the Financing Commitments on terms and conditions that would not (A) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Financing unless the Rollover Investment is
increased by a corresponding amount or (B) materially delay the receipt of the
Financing or make it materially less likely that the Financing would be
received, (iii) satisfy on a reasonably timely basis all conditions applicable
to Parent and Merger Sub contained in the Financing Commitments (including
definitive agreements related thereto) and the Rollover Letters, including
the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a
condition to the Financing, and (iv) consummate the Financing and the Rollover
Investment at or prior to the Closing Date (it being understood that it is
not a condition to Closing under this Agreement,

 



53

    

 nor to the consummation of the Merger, for Parent or Merger Sub to obtain
the Financing, the Rollover Investment or any alternative financing).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding
sentence, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, take all actions reasonably necessary to (i) maintain in effect
each Financing Commitment and each Rollover Letter (it being understood that
the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letters may be replaced or amended
as provided below) and (ii) enforce all of its rights under each Financing
Commitment (or any definitive agreements relating thereto) and each Rollover
Letter (it being agreed that nothing herein shall require the Parent to
commence litigation to enforce such rights). Upon request, Parent shall keep
the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing (including providing the Company with copies of material draft and
definitive agreements and other material documents related to the Financing)
and the Rollover Investment. Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
notice as promptly as reasonably practicable after obtaining Knowledge
thereof (x) of any material breach or default by any party to any of the
Financing Commitments, any Rollover Letter or definitive agreements related to
the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (y) of the receipt
of any written notice or other written communication from any Person with
respect to (1) any actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Commitments, any Rollover
Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of
any Financing Commitment, any Rollover Letter or definitive agreements related
to the Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among the
parties to any of the Financing Commitments, any Rollover Letter or definitive
agreements related to the Financing with respect to the obligation to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing or to
consummate the Rollover Investment or the amount of shares of Common Stock to
be contributed prior to Closing, and (z) any other circumstance that would
adversely affect the ability of Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of
the Financing or the Rollover Investment on a timely basis. As soon as
reasonably practicable and in any event within two (2) Business Days, Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of
the immediately preceding sentence. Parent shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Company, amend, modify, supplement or waive any of the
conditions or contingencies to funding contained in any Financing Commitment
(including definitive agreements related thereto) or to the making of the
Rollover Investment contained in any Rollover Letter, or any other provision
of, or remedies under, any Financing Commitment (including definitive
agreements related thereto) or any Rollover Letter, the effect of which (I)
reduces the amount of aggregate cash proceeds available from the Financing
unless there is a corresponding increase in the Rollover Investment, (II)
would delay, prevent or adversely impact, or, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have the effect of delaying,
preventing or adversely impacting, in each case, in any material respect, the
funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing)
on the Closing Date, or (III) would prevent or adversely impact or delay, or,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of preventing, adversely impacting, or delaying, in each case, in any

 



54

    

 material respect the ability of Parent to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date (any modification of the
type described in clauses (I) through (III), " _Restricted Modifications_ ");
provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may modify,
supplement or amend the Financing Commitments to (i) amend, replace,
supplement, or otherwise modify or waive any provision of any Debt Commitment
Letter and/or substitute other debt financing for all or a portion of the
Financing from the same and/or alternative Financing Sources, so long as such
amendments, replacements, supplements or modifications or waivers, or such
substitute financing, shall not expand in a material way the conditions
precedent contained therein or materially delay the funding of the Debt
Financing at Closing, (ii) reflect the exercise of any "market
flex" provisions in connection therewith, and (iii) add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, other agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Financing Commitments as of the date hereof or to
increase the amount of funds available thereunder, and Parent or Merger Sub
shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment,
modification, supplement, restatement or replacement. In the event all
conditions applicable to a Financing Commitment and/or a Rollover Letter have
been satisfied, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Lenders and the Rollover Investors to fund the Financing and make the
Rollover Investment, as applicable, required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably
practicable. In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable and such portion is not otherwise available under the Debt
Financing or Rollover Investment, as applicable, Parent shall notify the
Company and use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange alternative
financing from the same or other sources of financing that do not contain any
Restricted Modifications (such terms and conditions, the " _Alternate Terms
and Conditions_ "), in an amount sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Alternate Terms and
Conditions.

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, at
Parents sole cost and expense, use reasonable best efforts to provide all
reasonable cooperation requested by Parent, Merger Sub, any Financing Sources
and their respective authorized Representatives in connection with the
Financing (which, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_ shall include
any alternative financing), including:

 

(i) participating in, and causing the Companys management team, with
appropriate seniority and expertise, including senior officers, to

notice, including direct contact between such management and representatives
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Financing
Sources, potential lenders and investors for the Financing, on the other
hand;

 



55

    

(ii) providing to Parent, Merger Sub and the Financing Sources from time
to time all information and disclosures regarding the Company and its

relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries;

 

(vi) assisting Parent in obtaining corporate, credit, facility and
securities ratings from rating agencies;

(vii) facilitating the pledging of collateral;

 

(viii) taking corporate actions reasonably necessary or advisable to permit
the consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to
be made available to the Company by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately following the Effective Time;

 

(ix) cooperating with the Financing Sources due diligence, to the extent
customary and reasonable and not unreasonably interfering with the business
of the Company, including by granting the Financing Sources access as provided
in Section 5.3(a), subject to the limitations on, and requirements with
respect to, disclosure and access set forth in the second sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_;

 

(x) [reserved];

 

(xi) ensuring that any syndication efforts with respect to the Financing

Company;

(xii) cooperating with consultants or other suitable professional advisors
engaged to undertake field examinations and appraisals for purposes of the
Financing, including furnishing information to such Persons in respect of
accounts receivable, inventory and other applicable assets and providing
customary consent and release letters in respect of the resulting reports or

Companys existing ABL credit agreement; and

 



56

    

(xiii) assisting in the preparation and negotiation of, and executing and

other definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent
or the Financing Sources (including landlord waivers, and other third party
agreements, hedging arrangements, customary officers and other closing
certificates and back-up therefor and a solvency certificate of the chief
financial officer of the Company in the form contemplated by the Financing
Commitments); provided, that (A) the Company shall not be required to become
subject to any obligations or Liabilities with respect to any agreements or
documents under this clause (xiii) prior to the Closing and (B) nothing shall
obligate the Company to provide a solvency certificate or the like, any legal
opinion or other opinion of counsel, or any information that would, after
consultation with legal counsel, reasonably be expected to violate
any obligations of confidentiality or result in a violation of Law or loss of
any privilege; provided, further, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
be required under this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ to deliver any corporate
(or similar) authorization or approval of the execution of the Financing (or
any alternative financing), in each case, that would be effective prior to the
Effective Time and no officers or directors of the Company that will not be
continuing following the Merger (including for the avoidance of doubt any
non-employee directors of the Company who tender resignations effective as of

any agreement with respect to the Financing (including providing any
corporate (or similar) authorization or approval in connection therewith).

 

Any information provided to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 5.12(b)_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Parent shall,
on demand, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with
such cooperation (it being understood and agreed, however, that the Company
(and not Parent or Merger Sub) shall be responsible for (a) de minimis
expenses, (b) fees payable to existing legal, financial or other advisors of
the Company with respect to services provided prior to the Closing Date, (c)
any ordinary course amounts payable to existing employees of or consultants to
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates with
respect to services provided prior to the Closing Date and (d) any amounts
that would have been incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby regardless of the Financing). The Company and its Representatives shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any materials that
are to be presented during any meetings conducted in connection with the
Financing, and Parent shall give due consideration to any such comments
proposed by the Company and its Representatives. The Company hereby consents
to the reasonable use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with
the Financing; provided, that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to, and is not reasonably likely to, harm or disparage the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and its or their respective marks. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_
of this Agreement, as it applies to the Companys obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_, shall be deemed satisfied if the Companys material
breach hereof was not the primary cause of the failure of funding under the
Financing Commitments (including for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_).
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives shall not have any
responsibility for, or incur any Liability to any Person under or in
connection with, the arrangement of the Financing or any alternative financing
that Parent or Merger Sub may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this

 



57

    

 Agreement except arising from the actual and intentional fraud, willful
misconduct or intentional misrepresentation of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives from
and against any and all Damages suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing or any alternative financing,
except to the extent such Damages arose out of or resulted from the actual and
intentional fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives.

(c) In no event shall Parent or Merger Sub enter into any exclusivity,
lock-up or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding with any bank
or investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing
that could reasonably be expected to prevent such provider from providing or
seeking to provide such financing to any third party in connection with a
transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries (including a Takeover
Proposal), in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

5.13 _Section 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and

each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

5.14 _Agreements with Principal Shareholders_. From and after the date
hereof until the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, in no event shall Parent
or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, enter
into any Contract with any of the Principal Shareholders or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the business, operations or other interests
of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, unless such
Contract shall terminate, by its terms, upon the termination of this
Agreement without payment or penalty or any further obligations. In addition,
from and after the date hereof until the Requisite Company Vote is obtained,
in no event shall Parent amend, or waive any requirement under, the Voting
Agreement or any Rollover Letter, in each case, without the prior written
consent of the Company.

5.15 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time
or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ , the Company
shall control the defense of any Legal Action (including any class action or
derivative litigation) relating directly or indirectly to this Agreement or
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including disclosures made under
securities laws and regulations related thereto (" _Transaction Litigation_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall (a) provide Parent with
prompt notice of all Transaction Litigation (including by providing copies of
all pleadings with respect thereto) and keep Parent reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof, (b) keep Parent apprised of proposed strategy
and other significant decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by
the party receiving notice of Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the
attorney-client privilege between such party and its counsel is not
undermined or otherwise affected), (c) give Parent the right to review and
comment on all filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection
with any Transaction Litigation (and the Company shall in good faith take such
comments into account), and the

 opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement and prosecution of any
Transaction Litigation and (d) keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed
with respect to the status of such Transaction Litigation. Except as
permitted on _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no
compromise or settlement of any Transaction Litigation shall be agreed to by
the Company without Parents prior written consent.

5.16 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. The Company and the Company Board shall (a)
take all actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute
or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the Voting Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement; and (b) if any "anti-takeover" statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all
action within their power to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger
and such other transactions contemplated hereby.

5.17 _Applicable Exchange De-Listing; De-Registration Under Exchange Act_.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
on its part pursuant to applicable Law and the rules and regulations of the
Applicable Exchange to cause (a) the de-listing of the Common Stock from the
Applicable Exchange as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time
and (b) the de-registration of the Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act
as promptly as practicable after such de-listing. Following the Effective
Time, the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to take any additional
action necessary to cause the Common Stock to be de-listed from the
Applicable Exchange and de-registered under the Exchange Act at or as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

schedules hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure
Letter, the Guarantee, the Rollover Letters,

 



78

    

 the Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement (collectively, the "

8.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable,
then (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that
provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b)
the remainder of this Agreement and the application of that provision to
other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of that provision, or the application of that
provision, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such a determination, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a reasonably
acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

8.13 _Rules of Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. Subject to and without limiting the introductory
language to _Article III_ and _Article IV_ , each party to this Agreement has
or may have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a
section of such disclosure letter that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not constitute an
admission by such party that such item is material, that such item has had or
would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be, or that the disclosure of such be construed
to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

8.14 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and
assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of
law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights or liabilities under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its absolute discretion; and
any purported assignment without such prior written consents shall be
void; provided that, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any Financing
Source (so long as any such assignment does not relieve Parent or Merger Sub
of its respective obligations hereunder) under terms of the Financing solely
for the purpose of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning
collateral with respect to the Financing; and provided, further, that the
Parent may assign its rights and liabilities under this Agreement to any
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary.

8.15 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur
if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity,
and the parties to this Agreement hereby waive any requirement for the
posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection therewith. The parties
acknowledge and agree that each party hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each party hereto agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (a) the other party has an adequate remedy
at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or equity.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the parties hereto agree that the right of the Company to obtain an

 



80

    

 injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in each case to
cause Parent and Merger Sub to close the Merger or the Companys ability, as a
third-party beneficiary, to cause the Rollover Investment to be funded
pursuant to the Rollover Letters shall be subject to the requirements that:

 

(i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and  _Section_
__ _ 6.2_ would have been satisfied if the Closing were to have occurred at
the date Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions
taken at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the
Closing, or the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to
a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their respective representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement);

(ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ upon
delivery of a drawdown notice by Parent and/or notice from Parent that the
Rollover Investment will be funded at such date;

(iii) Parent fails to complete the Closing in accordance with  _Section_
__ _ 1.2_; and

(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that (A)
all of the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ have
been satisfied or that it is willing to waive any such open conditions, and
(B) if specific performance is granted and if the Financing and the Rollover
Investment were funded, it would take such actions that are required of it by
this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur.

 

In no event will the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce
specifically Parents obligation or the Companys ability, as a third-
party beneficiary, to cause the Rollover Investment to be funded or to
complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be
funded at the Closing if the Rollover Investment is funded at the Closing). In
no event shall the Company, any Company Related Party or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement against the Financing Sources, solely
in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the
Debt Financing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, while the
Company may be entitled to (i) specific performance, subject in all respects
to this _Section_ __ _ 8.15_, and (ii) payment of the Parent Termination Fee,
if, as and when payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_, under no
circumstances shall the Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or
entitled to receive (A) both a grant of specific performance or other
equitable relief pursuant to which the Merger is actually consummated and the
aggregate Merger Consideration is actually received, on the one hand, and
payment of all or a portion of the Parent Termination Fee or other monetary
damages hereunder, on the other hand, or (B) both payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, on the one hand, and payment of other monetary damages, on
the other hand.

(d) None of the Financing Sources will have any liability to the Company,
the Company Related Parties or any of their respective Affiliates relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing or otherwise, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company, the
Company Related Parties or any of their respective Affiliates will have any
rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum
aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub (and their Affiliates) for

applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure shall be
limited to an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee in the aggregate,
and in no event shall any Company Related Party seek or obtain, nor shall it
permit any of its Representatives or any other Persons on its or their behalf
to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award or any monetary
damages of any kind against the Parent Related Parties in excess of the
Parent Termination Fee in the aggregate.

contrary herein, no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
under or with respect to this Agreement without first obtaining the approval
of the Special Committee.

 

8.18 _No Recourse_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Financing Commitments to the

tort, contract or otherwise), based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement, the Financing, the Financing Commitments or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of any oral representations made
or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith and (ii) neither
the Company nor its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives shall have any

therewith. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, other than
pursuant to the Financing Commitments with respect to Parent and/or

 



82

    

 Merger Sub, (i) in no event shall any party hereto, nor any of its
Affiliates, and each of the parties hereto hereby agrees not to and to cause
its Affiliates not to, (a) seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any
claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary
damages from, any Financing Source or (b) seek to enforce the commitments
against, make any claims for breach of any Debt Commitment Letter against, or
seek to obtain any other damages of any kind from, or otherwise sue, the
Financing Sources for any reason, including in connection with any Debt
Commitment Letter. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.18_ shall in any way
limit or qualify the liabilities of the Financing Sources and the other

thereto) to each other thereunder or in connection therewith. No Financing
Source shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect
damages or damages or a tortious nature.
