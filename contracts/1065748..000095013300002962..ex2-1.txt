AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of
July 16, 2000 (this "Agreement"), among Career Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), CB Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and CareerBuilder, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company") (Sub and the Company being hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "Constituent Corporations").   W I T N E S
S E T H:   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company, based on the
unanimous recommendation of the Independent Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Independent Committee"), has determined that
the Merger (as defined below) is advisable, fair and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, has approved the Merger, the Offer (as defined below), this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and has recommended
approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company;   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Sub
have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, in furtherance of
such acquisition, Parent proposes to cause Sub to make a tender offer (as it
may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the
"Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares (the "Shares") of Common
Stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock")
at a purchase price of $8.00 per Share (the "Offer Price"), net to the seller
in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement; and the Board of Directors of the
Company has adopted resolutions approving the Offer and the Merger (as
defined below) and recommending that holders of Shares accept the Offer and
that the Company\'s stockholders approve this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the
respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have approved
and declared advisable the merger of Sub and the Company (the "Merger"), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, whereby each issued
and outstanding Share not owned directly or indirectly by Parent or the
Company will be converted into the right to receive the price per share paid
in the Offer and the respective Boards of Directors of Sub and the Company
have approved and adopted this Agreement; and   WHEREAS, in order to induce
Parent and Sub to enter into this Agreement, concurrently herewith Parent and
certain of the stockholders of the Company are entering into Stockholder
Agreements dated as of the date hereof (the "Stockholder Agreements") in the
forms of the attached Exhibit A.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
premises, representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, the
parties agree as follows:     7    ARTICLE I   THE OFFER   Section
1.1 The Offer. (a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as promptly
as practicable but in no event later than July 25, 2000, Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the
rules and regulations thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), the Offer. The Offer
shall provide for an initial expiration date on the Initial Expiration Date
(as defined below). The obligation of Sub to, and of Parent to cause Sub to,
commence the Offer and accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the
conditions set forth in the attached Exhibit B (the "Offer Conditions") (any
of which may be waived in whole or in part by Sub in its sole discretion,
except that Sub shall not waive the Minimum Condition (as defined in Exhibit
B) without the consent of the Company (acting through the Independent
Committee)) and subject to the rights of Parent and Sub to terminate this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1. Sub expressly reserves the right to
modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the consent of the
Company (acting through the Independent Committee), Sub shall not (i) reduce
the number of Shares subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii)
impose any other conditions to the Offer other than the Offer Conditions or
modify the Offer Conditions (other than to waive any Offer Conditions to the
extent permitted by this Agreement), (iv) except as provided in the next
sentence, extend the Offer or (v) change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sub may, without the consent of the
Company, (i) extend the Offer, if at the scheduled or extended expiration
date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions shall not be satisfied or
waived, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived,
(ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer and (iii) if all Offer
Conditions are satisfied or waived but the number of shares of Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer is less than 90% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock but at least 85% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an aggregate period of not more
than five business days beyond the latest expiration date that would
otherwise be permitted pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence, in
each case subject to the right of Parent, Sub or the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof. If at any scheduled expiration
date of the Offer, the Minimum Condition, the HSR Condition (as defined in
Exhibit B) or either of the conditions set forth in paragraphs (e) or (f) of
Exhibit B shall not have been satisfied, but at such scheduled expiration
date all the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (g) and
(h) of Exhibit B shall then be satisfied, at the request of the
Company (acting through the Independent Committee and confirmed in writing),
Sub shall extend the Offer from time to time, subject to the right of Parent,
Sub or the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms
hereof. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, Sub shall not be obligated to
extend the Offer if at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, (I) the
Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied, but at such scheduled
expiration date the HSR Condition and all the conditions set forth in
paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Exhibit B shall then
be satisfied; and (II) any person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d)(3)
of the Exchange Act), other than Parent, Sub or their affiliates or any group
of which any of them is a member, shall have announced and not withdrawn its
intention to acquire beneficial ownership (as determined pursuant to Rule
13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 25%    2  8   or more of
the Shares. Subject to the Offer Conditions and so long as this Agreement has
not been terminated in accordance with its terms, Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Sub becomes obligated to accept
for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after
the expiration of the Offer, and in any event in compliance with
the obligations respecting prompt payment pursuant to Rule 14e-1(c) under
the Exchange Act. Sub shall not provide for a subsequent offering period
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.   (b) On the date of
commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender
Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all supplements or amendments
thereto the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer, which shall contain as
an exhibit or incorporate by reference an offer to purchase and a related
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the
documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(including the Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3), together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"), and Parent and Sub
shall cause to be disseminated the Offer Documents to holders of Shares
as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent,
Sub and the Company each agrees promptly to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and Parent and Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer
Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The
Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the Offer Documents prior to their filing with the SEC or
dissemination to the stockholders of the Company. Parent and Sub agree to
provide the Company and its counsel any comments Parent, Sub or their counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after the receipt of such comments and to cooperate with the Company
and its counsel in responding to any such comments.   (c) Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary
to accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares that Sub becomes obligated to
accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer.   (d) Parent or Sub
shall engage an information agent in connection with the Offer.   Section
1.2 Company Actions. (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the
Offer and represents and warrants that the Board of Directors of the Company,
at a meeting duly called and held, at which all directors were present (in
person or by telephone), duly and unanimously adopted resolutions approving
and adopting this Agreement, approving the Offer and the Merger, taking all
action necessary to render the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL (as
defined below) inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger and the
Stockholder Agreements, determining that the terms of the Offer and the
Merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company\'s stockholders
and recommending that holders of Shares accept the Offer and that the
Company\'s stockholders approve this Agreement and the Merger. The Company
represents and warrants that its Board of Directors has received the opinion
of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation that the proposed consideration to
be received by holders of    3  9   Shares pursuant to the Offer and
the Merger is fair to such holders from a financial point of view, and a
complete and correct signed copy of such opinion has been delivered by the
Company to Parent. The Company consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company
described in this Section 1.2(a) provided that such recommendation has not
been withdrawn. The Company has been advised by each of its directors and
executive officers that each such person intends to tender all Shares owned
by such person pursuant to the Offer.   (b) On the date the Offer Documents
are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to time, the "Schedule
14D-9") containing the recommendation described in paragraph (a) (to the
extent such recommendation has not been withdrawn), and the Company shall
cause to be disseminated the Schedule 14D-9 to holders of Shares as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Each of the
Company, Parent and Sub agrees promptly to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that
such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to amend
or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders
of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its filing with the
SEC or dissemination to stockholders of the Company. The Company agrees to
provide Parent and its counsel any comments the Company or its counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after the receipt of such comments and to cooperate with Parent, Sub and
their counsel in responding to any such comments.   (c) In connection with
the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its transfer agent or
agents to furnish Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of Shares as of a recent date and of those
persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies
of all lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files
and all other information in the Company\'s possession or control, to the
extent reasonably available to the Company, regarding the beneficial owners
of Shares and any securities convertible into Shares, and shall furnish to
Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders,
security position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably
request in communicating the Offer to the Company\'s stockholders. Subject to
the requirements of applicable law, and except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent and Sub and their agents shall
hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and
files, will use such information only in connection with the Offer and
the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1, will, upon request, deliver, and will use their best efforts to
cause their agents to deliver, to the Company all copies of such information
then in their possession or control.     4  10    ARTICLE II   THE
MERGER   Section 2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, as amended (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined below). Following
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations
of Sub in accordance with the DGCL. At the election of Parent, any direct
wholly-owned Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) of Parent may be substituted
for Sub as a constituent corporation in the Merger provided such substitution
does not adversely affect the Company or its stockholders. In such event, the
parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, in order to
reflect such substitution.   Section 2.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall
become effective when the certificate of merger or, if applicable, the
certificate of ownership and merger (each, the "Certificate of Merger"),
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; provided, however,
that, upon mutual consent of the Constituent Corporations, the Certificate of
Merger may provide for a later date and time of effectiveness of the Merger
(not to exceed 10 days). When used in this Agreement, the term "Effective
Time" shall mean the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger is
accepted for record or such later date and time established by the
Certificate of Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made
on the date of the Closing (as defined in Section 2.9).   Section 2.3
Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
DGCL.   Section 2.4 Charter and By-laws; Directors and Officers. (a) At
the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
as amended, of the Company (the "Company Charter") shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law. At the Effective Time, the
Amended and Restated By-laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by the Company
Charter.   (b) The directors of Sub at the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company at the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.   Section 2.5
Conversion of Securities. (a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the Company or the holders
of any securities of the Constituent Corporations:    5  11    (i) Each
issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value  $.01 per share, of
Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully  paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving  Corporation.   (ii) Each Share held
in the treasury of the Company and each Share  owned by Parent or by any
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be  canceled and no capital stock of
Parent or other consideration shall be  delivered in exchange therefor.  
(iii) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective
Time (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with  Section 2.5(a)(ii)
and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in  Section 2.5(a)(iv)) shall be
converted into the right to receive from the  Surviving Corporation in cash,
without interest, the per share price paid  in the Offer (the "Merger
Consideration"). All such Shares, when so  converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be  canceled and retired and each holder
of a certificate representing any  such Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except  the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.   (iv) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the  contrary, if required by the DGCL but only to the extent required 
thereby, Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the 
Effective Time and which are held by holders who have properly exercised 
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of  the
DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") will not be converted into the right  to
receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Shares will be 
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares in 
accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until such 
holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to 
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any  such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such  right, such
Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been  converted into, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger  Consideration, without any
interest thereon. The Company will give Parent  prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisals of  Shares, withdrawal of such demands
and any instruments served pursuant to  the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of  Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or  offer to settle or settle any such
demands.   (b) Each Company Stock Option (as hereinafter defined) shall
be treated in accordance with Section 6.5 of this Agreement.   (c) Each
Warrant (as hereinafter defined) shall be treated in accordance with Section
6.6 of this Agreement.   Section 2.6 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying
Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company (or such other person or persons as shall be reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company) to act as paying agent in the Merger (the "Paying
Agent"), and, from time to time on, prior to or after the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available, or cause the Surviving Corporation to make
available, to the Paying Agent cash in amounts and at the times necessary for
the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of certificates
representing Shares as part of the Merger pursuant to Section 2.5. Any   
6  12   and all interest earned on funds made available to the Paying
Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid over to Parent.   (b)
Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Shares (the "Certificates"), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash into which the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate shall
have been converted pursuant to Section 2.5, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.6, each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the Shares
theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.5. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash
payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. Parent or the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as
Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code (as defined below) or under any
provisions of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made by the Parent or
the Paying Agent.   (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. All cash paid
upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II.   (d) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the funds
made available to the Paying Agent to pay the Merger Consideration which
remains undistributed to the holders of    7  13   Shares for six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and, subject to paragraph (e), any holders of Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II and the instructions set forth in the letter of
transmittal mailed to such holders after the Effective Time shall thereafter
look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration to which they are
entitled.   (e) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to
seven years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which any payment pursuant to this Article II would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined below)), the
cash payment in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled
thereto.   (f) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the amount of cash to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.5.   Section 2.7 Merger Without Meeting of
Stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sub, or any other direct or
indirect subsidiary of Parent, shall acquire at least 90 percent of the
outstanding Shares, the parties hereto agree to take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after expiration of the Offer without a meeting of stockholders
of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.   Section 2.8
Further Assurances. If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are
necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to
or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or
assets of either of the Constituent Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper
officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the Constituent Corporations,
all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the
name and on behalf of either Constituent Corporation, all such other acts and
things as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm
the Surviving Corporation\'s right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such
Constituent Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.   Section 2.9 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
and all actions specified in this Agreement to occur at the Closing shall
take place at the offices of Sidley and Austin, Bank One Plaza, 10 South
Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603, at 10:00 a.m., local    8 
14   time, no later than the second business day following the day on which
the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII shall have been fulfilled
or waived (if permissible) or at such other time and place as Parent and the

other than in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practices.   Section 4.14 Labor Matters. Except as set forth in Section 4.14
of the Company Letter, the Company is not a party to any collective
bargaining agreement or labor contract. The Company has not engaged in any
unfair labor practice with respect to any persons employed by or otherwise
performing services primarily for the Company (the "Company Business
Personnel"), and there is no unfair labor practice complaint or grievance
against the Company by any person pursuant to the National Labor Relations
Act or any comparable state or foreign law pending or threatened in writing
with respect to the Company Business Personnel, except where such unfair
labor practice, complaint or grievance would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. There is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown or

software) pursuant to which the Company has the right to use Company
Intellectual Property utilized in connection with any product of, or service
provided by, the Company, the cancellation or expiration of which would have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company (the "Company Licenses"). There are
no pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened interferences,
re-examinations, oppositions or cancellation proceedings involving any
patents or patent rights, trademarks or trademark rights, or applications
therefor of the Company, except such as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. There is no breach
or violation by the Company under, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,

Company has not licensed or otherwise permitted the use by any third party of
any proprietary information or Company Intellectual Property on terms or in a
manner which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse

As of the date hereof, the Company owns, and as of the Effective Time the
Company will own, good and marketable title to all of their assets material
to its business (excluding, for purposes of this sentence, assets held under
leases or assets covered under Section 4.15 hereof), free and clear of any

party signatory thereto, other than such defaults or events of default which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.   Section 4.17 State Takeover Statutes. The Board of Directors

with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of the Company.   ARTICLE V   COVENANTS RELATING TO

per share of Company Common Stock purchasable  under such Company Stock
Option. Each Substitute Parent Stock Option shall  in all other respects be
exercisable upon, and be subject to,  substantially the same terms and
conditions that were applicable to the  related Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time,  including the vesting and exercise
conditions then applicable to such  Company Stock Option without regard to
the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement; provided, however, that
shares of Parent Common Stock  purchased upon the exercise of each Substitute
Parent Stock Option shall,  for so long as Parent Common Stock is not traded
on an established stock  exchange or national market system, be subject to a
right of repurchase by  Parent at their fair market value under such
conditions as Parent shall  deem appropriate.   (ii) Immediately after the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option  that was granted prior to January
1, 2000 with an exercise price that is  less than $4.00 per share of Company
Common Stock and each Company Stock  Option held by a nonemployee director of
the Company, whether or not then  exercisable, shall be cancelled in
consideration for which the holder  thereof shall be entitled to receive a
cash payment from the Company equal  to (A) the product of (1) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock  subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective  Time and (2) the excess, if any, of the
Offer Price over the exercise  price per share of Company Common Stock
purchasable under such Company  Stock Option, minus (B) all applicable
federal, state and local Taxes  required to be withheld in respect of such
payment. Such amount shall be  paid as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time. The  surrender of a Company Stock Option in
exchange for the consideration  contemplated hereby shall be deemed a release
of any and all rights the  holder of such Company Stock Option had or may
have had in respect  thereof.   (iii) The Company shall take all action
necessary to permit each  holder of a Company Stock Option with an exercise
price that is equal to  or in excess of $4.00 per share of Company Common
Stock to elect in  writing at such holder\'s option, not later than the
acceptance of shares  for payment in the Offer, that such option shall be
cancelled immediately  after the Effective Time, in consideration for which
the holder thereof  shall be entitled to receive (A) a cash payment from the
Company equal to  (1) the product of one-third of the number of shares
subject to such  option immediately prior to the Effective Time, rounded up
to the nearest  whole share, and $4.00, minus (2) all applicable
federal,     28  34    state and local Taxes required to be withheld
in respect of such payment,  and (B) a Substitute Parent Stock Option to
purchase shares of Parent  Common Stock equal in number to two-thirds of the
shares subject to such  Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, rounded down  to the nearest whole share, at an exercise
price per share equal to the  fair market value of a share of Parent Common
Stock at the Effective Time.  One-half of each such Substitute Parent Stock
Option shall become vested  and exercisable on the first anniversary of the
Effective Time and the  remainder of such option shall become exercisable on
the second  anniversary of the Effective Time, provided that the holder of
such option  remains employed by the Company or Parent on the date of each
such  anniversary. Such Substitute Parent Stock Options shall in all other 
respects be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions that  were
applicable to the related Company Stock Option immediately prior to  the
Effective Time; provided, however, that shares of Parent Common Stock 
purchased upon the exercise of each Substitute Parent Stock Option shall, 
for so long as Parent Common Stock is not traded on an established stock 
exchange or national market system, be subject to a right of repurchase by 
Parent at their fair market value under such conditions as Parent shall  deem
appropriate. The cash amounts payable pursuant to this paragraph  (iii) shall
be paid as soon as reasonably practicable following the  Effective Time. The
surrender of a Company Stock Option in exchange for  the consideration
contemplated by this paragraph (iii) shall be deemed a  release of any and
all rights the holder of such Company Stock Option had  or may have had in
respect thereof. If the holder of any Company Stock  Option eligible to be
treated as provided in this paragraph (iii) shall  not elect to have such
Company Stock Option treated as provided in this  paragraph (iii), then such
Company Stock Option shall be treated as  provided in paragraph (ii)
above.   (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Stock Options 
described in Section 6.5 of the Company Letter shall be treated as  described
therein.   Section 6.6 Warrants. Each Warrant issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Warrants that are subject
to performance criteria for vesting and are not vested pursuant to their
terms) shall, by virtue of the Merger, no longer be exercisable into the
right to receive shares of Company Common Stock, but shall after the
Effective Time represent the right to receive an amount equal to (A) the
product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Warrant and (2) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock applicable to such Warrant
minus (B) all applicable federal and local taxes required to be withheld in
respect of such payment, without interest.   Section 6.7 Reasonable Best
Efforts. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including: (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from all Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from,    29  35   or
to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity (including
those in connection with the HSR Act, any other pre-merger filings and State
Takeover Approvals), (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No party to this Agreement
shall consent to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the
other parties to this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   (b) Each party shall use all reasonable best efforts to not
take any action, or enter into any transaction, which would cause any of
its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
result in a breach of any covenant made by it in this Agreement.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
connection with any filing or submission required or action to be taken by
either Parent or the Company to effect the Offer, the Merger and
to consummate the other transactions contemplated hereby, the Company shall
not, without Parent\'s prior written consent, commit to any divestiture
transaction, and neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be required
to divest or hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action
that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
the Company or any of the businesses or assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or that otherwise would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.   Section 6.8 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company will not
issue any press release with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise issue any written public statements with respect
to such transactions without prior consultation with the other party, except
as may be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or the Nasdaq
National Market.   Section 6.9 State Takeover Laws. If any "fair price,"
"business combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other
similar statute or regulation shall become applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby or the Stockholder Agreements, Parent and the Company and
their respective Boards of Directors shall use their reasonable best efforts
to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to minimize
the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 6.10 Indemnification; Directors and Officers
Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all past and present
officers and directors of the Company to the same extent and in the same
manner such persons are entitled to indemnification and advancement of
expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the
DGCL, the Company Charter or the Company\'s Amended and Restated By-Laws for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.     30 
36    (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an
aggregate period of not less than six years from the Effective Time,
the Company\'s current directors and officers an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to
the Effective Time (the "DandO; Insurance") that is substantially similar to
the Company\'s existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that
the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for
the DandO; Insurance in excess of 200% of the last annual premiums paid prior
to the date hereof (which premiums the Company has disclosed to Parent), but
in such case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount.  
(c) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and may be enforced by, each person entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Section 6.10.   Section 6.11 Notification of Certain Matters. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to the Company,
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice
to Parent, of: (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which it is aware and which would be
reasonably likely to cause (x) any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement and made by it to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect or (y) any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this
Agreement and made by it not to be complied with or satisfied in all material
respects, (ii) any failure of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to
comply in a timely manner with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder or (iii) any
change or event which would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   Section
6.12 Real Estate Transfer and Gains Tax. Either the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all state or local Taxes, if any (collectively, the
"Gains Taxes"), attributable to the transfer of the beneficial ownership of
the Company\'s real properties, and any penalties or interest with respect
thereto, payable in connection with the consummation of the Offer and the
Merger. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in the filing of any returns
with respect to the Gains Taxes, including supplying in a timely manner a
complete list of all real property interests held by the Company and any
information with respect to such properties that is reasonably necessary
to complete such returns. The portion of the consideration allocable to the
real properties of the Company shall be determined by Parent in its
reasonable discretion. The stockholders of the Company shall be deemed to

Section 6.12 in the preparation of any return with respect to the Gains

(ii) if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order,  decree or ruling
or taken any other action permanently enjoining,  restraining or otherwise
prohibiting the acceptance for payment of, or  payment for, Shares pursuant

Company\'s fiduciary duties under  applicable law, provided that the Company
has complied with all provisions  of Section 5.2, including the notice
provisions therein, and that it has  complied with the requirements of
Section 6.4(b) relating to the payment  (including the timing of any payment)
of the Expenses and the Termination  Fee to the extent required by Section

Independent Committee), if (i)  any of the representations or warranties of
Parent or Sub set forth in this  Agreement that are qualified as to
materiality shall not be true and  correct in any respect or any such
representations or warranties that are  not so qualified shall not be true
and correct in any material respect, or  (ii) Parent or Sub shall have failed
to perform in any material respect any  material obligation or to comply in
any material respect with any material  agreement or covenant of Parent or
Sub to be performed or complied with by  it under this Agreement and such
untruth, incorrectness or failure cannot  be or has not been cured within 30
days after the giving of written notice  to Parent or Sub, as applicable;
or     33  39     (g) by the Company (acting through the Independent
Committee), if the  Offer has not been timely commenced in accordance with
Section 1.1.   The right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1 shall remain operative and in full force and

hereto, any person controlling any such party or any of their respective
officers or directors, whether prior to or after the execution of this
Agreement.   Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination

respective officers or directors (except for the last sentence of Section 6.2
and the entirety of Section 6.4, which shall survive the termination);
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 8.2 shall relieve
any party hereto from any liability for any breach of a representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement, the breach of any covenant contained in

economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
