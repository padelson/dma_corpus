subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") and
the Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") have each approved,
and declared it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders to consummate, the merger of the Company and Merger Sub upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

 



 

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the Merger, the Parent Board, the Company Board and
the Board of Directors of Merger Sub have each approved this Agreement and the
merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the DGCL; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company Board has resolved to recommend to the Companys
stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the approval of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement, each of the
Companys stockholders listed on _Schedule A_ is contemporaneously entering
into a Voting Agreement, of even date herewith (each, a " _Voting Agreement_
"), with Parent, in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

THE MERGER

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), whereupon
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company
shall continue its corporate existence under Delaware law as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL and other
applicable Laws. Accordingly, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
have all the properties, rights, privileges, powers, interests and franchises
and shall be subject to all restrictions, disabilities, debts, duties and
liabilities of the Company and Merger Sub. The Surviving Corporation may, at
any time after the Effective Time, take any action (including executing and
delivering any document) in the name and on behalf of either the Company or
Merger Sub in order to carry out and effectuate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

1.2 _Effective Time_.

 



 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cause an appropriate
Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Secretary
of State_ ") in such form and executed as provided in the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective (the " _Effective Time_ ") upon the later of (i) the
date of filing of a properly executed Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State in accordance with the DGCL, and (ii) such time, if any, as the
parties shall agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger.
The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made as soon as practicable
on the Closing Date.

 



 

1.3 _Closing_.

 



 

Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the transactions
contemplated herein abandoned pursuant to Section 7.1, and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, the closing
of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York
time, on a date to be specified by the parties hereto, which shall be no later
than the fifth Business Day after satisfaction or waiver (by the party
entitled to waive the condition) of all of the conditions set forth in Article
VI (except for those conditions that can by their nature be satisfied only at
the time of the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions) (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of Davis Graham and Stubbs
LLP, 1550 17th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202, unless another date
and/or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

 



 

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable Law, in each
case consistent with the obligations set forth in Section 5.8.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation

 



      
 

 



 

until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof
and applicable Law, in each case consistent with the obligations set forth in
Section 5.8.

 



 

1.5 _Directors_.

 



 

Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 



 

1.6 _Officers_.

 



 

The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

CONVERSION OF SHARES

 



 

2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_.

 



 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any party or the holder of any of their securities:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective
Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_. Subject to Section 2.1(d) and Section 2.6,
each issued and outstanding share of common stock (together with the preferred
share purchase rights (the " _Company Rights_ ") granted pursuant to the
Company Rights Agreement), par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (referred
to herein as " _Shares_ " or " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Excluded
Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $14.50, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

(c) _Cancellation of Shares_. Shares of Company Common Stock, when converted
in accordance with Section 2.1(b), shall cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
or book

 



      
 

 



 

entry Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock previously
represented thereby, the Merger Consideration, without interest, to be paid in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate or book entry
Share in accordance with Section 2.4.

 



 

(d) _Treasury Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company
as treasury shares or by Parent or Merger Sub or by any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the
Effective Time and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable therefor
(all such shares, the " _Excluded Shares_ ").

 



 

2.2 _Dissenter s Rights_.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are held by any record holder who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.1, but instead at the Effective Time shall
become the right to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and, at the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dissenting Shares
held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall
have withdrawn or otherwise lost their rights to appraisal of such shares
under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the
Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon. The Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock and provide Parent
with the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

2.3 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) Each stock option with respect to a share of Company Common Stock granted
under the Companys 1997 Stock Incentive Plan or 2007 Stock Incentive Plan
(together the " _Company Stock Incentive Plans_ "), whether or not vested that
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Company Option_ "), shall be treated as follows as of the Effective Time: the
Company shall cause, as of the Effective Time, (i) any Company Option that has
an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration to be cancelled for no consideration and (ii) any Company Option
that has an exercise price per share that is less than the Merger
Consideration (the " _In-the-Money Company Options_ ") to be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable
withholding

 



      
 

 



 

Taxes and without interest) equal to the product of (i) the excess of (A) the
Merger Consideration over (B) the per share exercise price of Company Common
Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not vested). As of
the Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except, with respect to In-the-
Money Company Options, the right to receive the payment described in the
immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(b) The Company shall take all steps necessary prior to the Effective Time to
cause the Company Options to be treated as set forth in this Section 2.3,
including providing any necessary notices and obtaining any necessary consents
or waivers.

 



 

2.4 _Exchange of Company Common Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with the Companys transfer agent or a bank or
trust company designated by Parent (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance
with this Article II, through the Paying Agent, sufficient cash to make
pursuant to this Article II all deliveries of cash in respect of Company
Common Stock as required by this Article II. Any cash deposited with the
Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The
Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, provided
that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent. Except as contemplated hereby, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder, as of
the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or book entry Share that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of Company Common Stock
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the corresponding certificates to the
Paying Agent or receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" with
respect to book entry Shares, and shall be in customary form as directed by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the certificates or book entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented thereby. Promptly after the Effective Time,
upon surrender of certificates or book entry Shares for cancellation to the
Paying Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly completed and
duly executed, and such other documents as may be

 



      
 

 



 

required pursuant to such instructions, the holders of such certificates or
book entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
promptly as practicable, a check in the amount equal to the aggregate amount
of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1;
provided, however, that any cash payment in excess of $500,000 payable to a
single stockholder shall, at the election of such stockholder, be paid by wire
transfer pursuant to wire transfer instructions provided by such stockholder
(fees for any such wire transfer to be borne by such stockholder). No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to a
transferee if the certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock
is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer, and the Person requesting such exchange
shall pay to the Paying Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such taxes have been
paid or are not payable.

 



 

(c) _No Further Rights in Company Common Shares_. The Merger Consideration
paid upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock after 365 days
following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and,
from and after such delivery to Parent, any former holders of Company Common
Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any Liens,
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official or Governmental Entity pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 



 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in form and substance
acceptable to Parent and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the consideration payable pursuant to
Section

 



      
 

 



 

2.1 hereof in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such certificate.

 



 

(g) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct, withhold and pay over to the applicable
Taxing authority from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Options such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required
to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent and paid over to the applicable Taxing
authority for the account of a holder of Company Common Stock or Company
Options, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Company Common Stock or Company Options in respect of whom such
deduction, withholding and payment was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

2.5 _Stock Transfer Books_.

 



 

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares
of Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, any certificates or book entry Shares
presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason shall represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby.

 



 

2.6 _Certain Adjustments_.

 



 

If, after the date of this Agreement and at or prior to the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number of shares or type of securities by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, stock split, subdivision, combination or exchange
of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities is declared
thereon or rights issued in respect thereof with a record date within such
period, or any similar event occurs (any such action, an " _Adjustment Event_
"), the Merger Consideration will be adjusted accordingly to provide to the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options the same economic effect
as contemplated hereby prior to such Adjustment Event.

Letter_ ") (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered
representation, warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein and such
other representations, warranties or covenants to the extent a matter in such
section is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to such other
representation, warranty or covenant reasonably apparent), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Organization_.

 



 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity
duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, and has all requisite
corporate or other power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.

 



 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to
do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which such qualification or licensing is required, except such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) The Company has previously delivered to Parent a complete and correct copy
of each of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws in each case as amended
(if so amended) to the date of this Agreement, and has delivered the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of each
of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended (if so amended) to the date of
this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar governing
documents.

 



 

(d) Section 3.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
correct list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Company and their respective
jurisdictions of incorporation or organization, the entity that owns each
Subsidiarys equity and the percentage ownership reflected thereby. Other than

respective certificates or articles of incorporation and bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company do not contain any
provision limiting or otherwise restricting the ability of the Company to
control, or vote the securities of, its Subsidiaries in any material respect.

 



 

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 20,000,000 shares

material changes have been made to any such forms in connection with any
award. No outstanding stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights, phantom stock, profit participation, performance
shares or other equity-based awards associated with shares of Company Common
Stock have been issued or are outstanding other than pursuant to the Company
Stock Incentive Plans.

options, warrants, preemptive rights, subscriptions, calls, or other rights,
convertible securities, agreements, claims or commitments of any character

agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with
respect to the voting of the capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the
following information with respect to each Company Option outstanding as of

Option, (iii) the exercise price of such Company Option, (iv) the date on

qualified stock option, (vi) the applicable vesting schedule, if any, and the
extent to which such Company Option is vested and, if applicable, exercisable

Subsidiaries are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear
of any Liens, other than statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable and
such other restrictions as may exist under applicable Law, and all such shares
or other ownership interests have been duly authorized, validly issued and are

Subsidiary in another Subsidiary of the Company), or is obligated to make any
capital contribution to or other investment in any other Person (other than
interests of the Company or any Subsidiary in another Subsidiary of the
Company), other than shares of capital stock or other securities owned
pursuant to investments and cash management in the ordinary course of
business.

 



 

(e) No indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contains any
restriction upon (i) the prepayment of any indebtedness of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or (iii) the ability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to grant any Lien on the properties or assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights
generally, and (ii) the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity).

the case of clause (ii) and clause (iii), for such conflicts, violations,

make the certification required of him or her under Sections 302 or 906 of the
SOX and no enforcement action has been initiated against the Company relating
to disclosures contained in any Company SEC Documents.

3.6 _Internal Control Over Financial Reporting; Disclosure Controls_.

 



 

The Company has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act). The Companys disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company,

 



      
 

 



 

including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and to the knowledge of the Company such disclosure controls and
procedures are currently effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their
most recent evaluation, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of
the Company Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of internal controls which could adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for
the Companys auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls. The
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Company
have made all certifications required by SOX, the Exchange Act and any related
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the Company SEC
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are complete
and correct. The management of the Company has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the year ended
October 31, 2011, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or
circumstances that would prevent its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of SOX,
without qualification, when next due.

 



 

3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

 



 

(a) Since October 31, 2011, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective business and operations only in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice, (ii) there has not occurred or continued to
exist any event, change, occurrence, effect, fact, circumstance or condition
which, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would be reasonably
likely to have or result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (iii)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that if
taken after the date of this Agreement would constitute a violation of Section
5.1 (other than clause (a) thereof).

 



 

(b) Since October 31, 2011, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received notice that any Company Permit will be terminated or modified or
cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of business, and the Company has no
knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such termination, modification or
nonrenewal, in each case except for any such termination, modification or
renewal that individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not
violate any Company Permit, or result in any termination, modification or
nonrenewals thereof, except in each case for any such violations,

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on July 3, 2012 (the " _Go-Shop Period_ "),
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors,
affiliates, agents and other representatives (the " _Representatives_ ") shall
have the right, under the direction of the Company Board or any committee
thereof, to: (i) initiate, solicit and encourage Acquisition Proposals (or
inquiries, proposals or offers or other efforts or attempts that are
reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), including by way of
providing access to non-public information pursuant to (but only pursuant to)
one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements; provided, that the Company
shall concurrently provide to Parent any material non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person
given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives; and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with respect
to Acquisition Proposals or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate
in, or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations.
On the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list
of all Qualified Go-Shop Bidders.

 



 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by Section 5.3(c) and Section 5.3(d), the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its Representatives to,
(i) beginning at 12:01 a.m. (New York City time) on July 4, 2012 (the " _No-
Shop Period Start Date_ "), immediately cease any solicitation, facilitation,
encouragement, discussions

 



      
 

 



 

or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal and request that any such Person promptly return or
destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries and (ii) from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VII, not to, directly or indirectly, (x) initiate, solicit, knowingly
encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing information), or take
any other action designed to lead to, any inquiries or the making or
submission of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or (y) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or
data relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to
the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any Person that has made an Acquisition Proposal or to any Person that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives believes or
has reason to believe is or may be contemplating an Acquisition Proposal. Any
violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the Companys Subsidiaries
or by any Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not such Representative is so authorized and whether or not such
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by
the Company. Notwithstanding the commencement of the obligations of the
Company under this Section 5.3(b), from and after the No-Shop Period Start
Date through July 17, 2012 (the " _Cutoff Date_ "), the Company may continue
to engage with, and provide information as contemplated by this Agreement to,

Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from
such third party, (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith that such
proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior
Proposal, after receiving such advice of its financial advisors, and (iii) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that the failure to participate in such negotiations or discussions
or to furnish such information or data to such third party would be reasonably
expected to result in a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, provided that the Company shall not deliver any information to
such third party without entering into a confidentiality agreement on terms no
less favorable to the Company than the Company Confidentiality Agreement
(provided that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any
"standstill" or similar provision that would prohibit such Party from making
any Acquisition Proposal) and containing additional provisions that expressly
permit the Company to comply with the terms of this Section 5.3 (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Nothing contained in this Section
5.3 shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing
to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or from making any similar disclosure,

 



      
 

 



 

in either case to the extent required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall have the right (i) to waive the provisions of any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to permit a Qualified Go-Shop Bidder to
make an Acquisition Proposal on a non-public basis to the Company and the
Company Board, (ii) to continue to engage in the activities described in
Section 5.3(a) following the No-Shop Period Start Date with any Qualified Go-
Shop Bidder until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the Cutoff Date, and
(iii) to engage in the activities described in Section 5.3(c) with respect to
any Person, including a Person that was previously a Qualified Go-Shop Bidder,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 5.3(c).

 



 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.3(e) or Section 5.3(f),
beginning as of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall directly or indirectly (i) (A) withdraw (or amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to
withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the
Company Recommendation, or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter
into, any agreement, including any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding, (A) constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
permitted pursuant to Section 5.3(a) or (c)) (each an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ ") or (B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding Section 5.3(d), at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Required Vote, and subject to the Companys material compliance at all times
with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section 5.6, with respect to a
Superior Proposal the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change
or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) if, and only after, the
Company Board (x) provides written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board or a committee thereof has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, and identifying the Person or group making such
Superior Proposal, and (y) determines in good faith, (1) after receipt of
advice from its financial advisors that any alternative transaction (including
any modifications to the terms of this Agreement) proposed by Parent is not at
least as favorable to the Company and its stockholders from a financial point
of view (taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and identity of the offeror and
the financial capacity of the offeror to consummate the transaction) as the
Superior Proposal, and (2) after receipt of advice from its outside counsel
that its failure to do so would be reasonably expected to result in a breach
of its fiduciary duties under Laws applicable to the Company; provided,
however, that (I) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof may make
an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to Section 7.1(d) until the fourth Business Day after receipt of a
Notice of Superior Proposal by Parent, (II) any change in the financial or
other material terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Superior Proposal and a new four Business Day period under this Section
5.3(e), and (III) during any such four Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with respect to any changes
or modifications to this Agreement which would allow the Company Board not to
make such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(d) consistent with its fiduciary duties.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding Section 5.3(d), at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Required Vote, and subject to the Companys material compliance at all times
with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section 5.6, solely in response to
an Intervening Event, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change described in clause (A) of the definition thereof if the Company Board
(i) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and any other advisor it chooses to consult, that the failure to make
such Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably expected to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (ii) provides written
notice to Parent (a " _Company Notice of Change_ ") advising Parent that the
Company Board is contemplating making an Adverse Recommendation Change under
this Section 5.3(f) and specifying the material facts and information
constituting the basis for such contemplated determination; provided, however,
that (x) the Company Board may not make such an Adverse Recommendation Change
until the fourth Business Day after receipt by Parent of the Company Notice of
Change and (y) during such four Business Day period, if requested by Parent,
the Company shall negotiate in good faith with respect to any changes or
modifications to this Agreement which would allow the Company Board not to
make such Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with its fiduciary duties.
" _Intervening Event_ " means any material event, development, circumstance,
occurrence or change in circumstances or facts (including any change in
probability or magnitude of circumstances) not related to an Acquisition
Proposal that was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board on
the date hereof (or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which
were not known or reasonably foreseeable to or understood by the Company Board
as of the date hereof).

 



 

(g) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company set
forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this Section 5.3, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof (but in no event later than 48 hours after
the Companys receipt thereof), the Company shall advise Parent in writing of
any request for information (other than a request for information in the
ordinary course of business and unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal) or any
Acquisition Proposal received from any Person, or any inquiry, discussions or
negotiations with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and the terms and
conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or
negotiations, and the Company shall promptly provide to Parent copies of any
written materials received by the Company in connection with any of the
foregoing, and the identity of the Person or group making any such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or with whom any discussions or negotiations
are taking place. The Company agrees that it shall simultaneously provide to
Parent any information concerning the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or any of its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person or group in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided to
Parent. The Company shall keep Parent promptly informed of the status of any
Acquisition Proposals (including the identity of the Persons and price
involved and any changes to any material terms and conditions thereof).
Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to the immediately preceding
sentence, prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, the only obligations of the
Company under this Section 5.3(g) shall be (i) to advise Parent in writing of
any Acquisition Proposal received from any Person, including the identity of
such Person and the price involved, (ii) to provide to Parent copies of any
materials received in connection therewith, (iii) to advise Parent in writing
of any material developments in connection therewith, including any changes to
any material terms or conditions thereof and (iv) the immediately following
sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at the
request of any Person that is subject to any existing "standstill" or similar
obligation to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company Board shall be
permitted, to the extent it determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Laws applicable
to the Company, to modify, waive, amend or affirmatively release any such
existing standstill obligations owed by any such Person to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, solely to permit any such Person to submit an Acquisition
Proposal to the Company Board.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall mean
any transaction or series of transactions involving the (i) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business or assets that (in the aggregate)
constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or the assets (based
on the fair market value thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of
any class of equity securities or capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whose business (in the aggregate) constitutes 20% or more of the
net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (iii) merger, consolidation, restructuring, transfer of assets
or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer,
exchange offer, recapitalization, stock repurchase program or other similar
transaction or series of transactions that if consummated would result in any
Person or Persons beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business (in the
aggregate) constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the
transactions contemplated hereby. The term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall
mean any proposal, whether or not in writing, for any Acquisition Transaction.
The term " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal made after the date hereof that was not solicited or initiated by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
in breach of this Section 5.3, made by a third party to purchase all or
substantially all of the Companys assets or all of the outstanding equity
securities of the Company pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer or merger
(i) on terms which the Company Board determines in good faith to be superior
to the Company and its stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders) from a
financial point of view as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby
and to any alternative transaction or changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(e)

 



      
 

 



 

(after consultation with its financial advisors, and taking into account all
financial, legal and regulatory terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal and this Agreement, including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement offered by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal, including
any conditions to and expected timing of consummation, and any risks of non-
consummation, of such Acquisition Proposal and taking into account all other
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such proposal), and (ii) which the
Company Board reasonably believes is likely to be consummated on its terms.

 



 

(i) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company and its Subsidiaries will, and will instruct their respective
Representatives to, cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions
or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
possible Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it shall (i) take the
necessary steps to promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries Representatives
involved in the transactions contemplated hereby of the obligations undertaken
in Section 5.3(b) and (ii) request each Person who has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with such Persons consideration of
acquiring the Company or any portion thereof to return or destroy (which
destruction shall be certified in writing by an executive officer of such
Person) all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or
on its behalf.

 



 

5.4 _Access to Information and Properties_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information and obtaining any required consents of third parties,
including third party operators of the Companys assets (with respect to which
consents each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain),
during the period prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) afford to the authorized
Representatives of Parent reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
all of its properties, contracts, books, commitments, records, data and books
and personnel, and (ii) make available to Parent all information concerning
its business, properties and personnel in its possession as the other parties
may reasonably request, and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
access to any such information in any third party operators possession, and a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed, published, announced or received by it in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby during such period pursuant to the
requirements of applicable Law (including pursuant to the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the rules of any Governmental Entity thereunder), as
applicable (other than documents which are not permitted to be disclosed under
applicable Law). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize
any attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company, Merger Sub and
Parent will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, Parent and its
authorized Representatives, including engineers, advisors and consultants,
lenders and financing sources, upon reasonable notice and in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, may enter into and upon all or any portion of the real property
owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in order to
investigate and assess, as Parent reasonably deems necessary or appropriate,
the environmental condition of such real property and the other assets or the
businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (an " _Investigation_ ").
An Investigation may include a Phase I environmental site assessment, or
similar investigation. In the event that Parent determines that more than an
Investigation is required in order to properly determine the environmental
condition of such real property, including without limitation, any sampling or
testing of soil and/or ground or surface waters at, on or under any real
property, then Parent shall provide the Company with a copy of the report
prepared with respect to such property and a written report describing the
proposed activities to be performed, provided, however, that no such
activities shall be performed by Parent or its Representatives without the
Companys prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
denied. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, cooperate with Parent and its Representatives in
conducting any such Investigation, facilitating further testing or evaluation
as may be reasonably prudent with respect to matters identified in the
Investigation, allow Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the
Companys and its Subsidiaries businesses, real property and other assets,
together with full permission to conduct any such Investigation, and provide
to Parent and its Representatives all plans, soil or surface or ground water
tests or reports, any environmental investigation results, reports or
assessments previously or contemporaneously conducted or prepared by or on
behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any of their predecessors that are
in the possession of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and all
information relating to environmental matters regarding the Companys and its
Subsidiaries businesses, real property and other assets that are in the
possession of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Parent will hold any information contemplated under Section 5.4(a) and/or
Section 5.4(b) in accordance with the provisions of the Company
Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that Parents obligations under
the Company Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate on the earlier of (i)
the date provided therein or (ii) the Effective Time. The Company shall not be
responsible to Parent for personal injuries sustained by Parents
Representatives in connection with the access provided pursuant to this
Section 5.4, and shall be indemnified and held harmless by Parent for any
losses suffered by the Company or its Representatives in connection with any
such personal injuries.

 



 

(d) No Investigation by Parent or its representatives shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company set forth
in this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

5.5 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including
(i) the use of commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions
precedent to the obligations of any of the parties hereto, (ii) the obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval
or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties, (iv) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (v) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that none of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any fees or make any other payments to any such Person in
order to obtain any such approval, consent, ratification, permission, waiver
or authorization (other than normal filing fees imposed by Law). Each of the
parties hereto will furnish to the other parties such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as such other parties may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and will provide the other parties with copies
of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity (except for
filings available publicly on the SECs public filing system) or any other
information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that neither
party is obligated to share any document submitted to or received from a
Governmental Entity that reflects the negotiations between the parties or the
valuation of some or all of any partys business or assets.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall
(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in (A)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents,
permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be obtained
from, any third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely making all such filings and
timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, (ii)
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or to cause to be taken, all
other actions and to do, or to cause to be done, all other things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any

 



      
 

 



 

event no later than the Termination Date), (iii) subject to applicable legal
limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, keep each other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including to the extent permitted by Law
promptly furnishing the other with true and complete copies of notices or
other communications sent or received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their Subsidiaries, to or from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect thereto, and permit the other to review in
advance any proposed communication by such party to any supervisory or
Governmental Entity and (iv) give the other reasonable notice of, and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, allow the other to attend and
participate at any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry or proceeding relating thereto.

 



 

(c) The Company agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, employees, advisors and accountants to, reasonably
cooperate with Parent and its affiliates in connection with the arrangement of
any financing to be consummated prior to or contemporaneously with the Closing
in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, including participation in
meetings, due diligence sessions, obtaining comfort letters from the Companys
accountants, obtaining consents from the Companys experts, obtaining legal
opinions from the Companys outside counsel, and obtaining and providing
Parent with title and ownership records relating to the Company Oil and Gas
Properties, as may be reasonably requested by Parent. In conjunction with the
obtaining of any such financing, the Company agrees, at the reasonable request
of Parent, to call for prepayment or redemption, or to prepay or redeem, or to
attempt to renegotiate the terms of, any then existing indebtedness for
borrowed money of the Company; provided, however, that no such prepayment or
redemption or call for prepayment or redemption or renegotiated terms shall
actually be made or become effective (nor shall the Company be required to
incur any liability in respect of any such prepayment or redemption or call
therefor or renegotiation thereof) prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.5, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all
respects with each other and shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.5 shall limit a
partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) so
long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its
obligations under this Section 5.5.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to,

 



      
 

 



 

without the prior written consent of Parent, divest or hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom, or after
the Merger, the freedom of action of Parent or any of Parents affiliates with
respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company and its Subsidiaries or any
of the respective businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates, and (ii) neither Parent
nor any of its affiliates shall be required to divest or hold separate (or
agree to divest or hold separate) or otherwise take or commit to take any
action that limits in any material respect its freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, any businesses, product lines or assets of
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or affiliates.

 



 

(f) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate, subject to a
customary joint defense agreement, in, but not control, the defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors
or officers relating to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated
hereby; provided _,_ however _,_ that no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

 



 

5.6 _Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing and the Company shall cause to
be filed with the SEC, in connection with the Merger, a proxy statement in
preliminary form (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Proxy Statement_ "). Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish the information required
to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as practicable after filing. The Company shall as promptly as
practicable thereafter mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall respond promptly to any
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without
providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at
any time after the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Companys
stockholders and prior to the Special Meeting any information relating to the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub which is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
so that the Proxy Statement will not include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

(b) All documents that the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein will comply as to

 



      
 

 



 

form in all material respects with applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the
staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the Merger.

 



 

(c) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and with applicable Law, promptly
and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as practicable, and
in no event later than 45 days after the date the Company begins mailing the
Proxy Statement to its stockholders, a special meeting of its stockholders for
the sole purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement (the "
_Special Meeting_ "), and shall, except as otherwise provided in Section
5.3(e) or Section 5.3(f) (and in compliance therewith), (i) recommend adoption
of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders and include in the Proxy
Statement such recommendation and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit and obtain such adoption. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with Section 5.3(e) or Section 5.3(f) or the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal, or any other fact or circumstance (except
for the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1), this Agreement
shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Special Meeting
for the purpose of adopting this Agreement. At any such Special Meeting
following any such withdrawal, amendment or modification of the Boards
recommendation of this Agreement, the Company may submit this Agreement to its
stockholders without a recommendation or with a negative recommendation
(although the approval of this Agreement by the Board may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event the Board may, subject to Section 5.3(e) or Section
5.3(f), communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation or negative
recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto.

 



 

5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 



 

The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any fact, event or
circumstance as to which the Company obtains knowledge that would be
reasonably likely to result in a failure of a condition set forth in Sections
6.3(a) or 6.3(b). Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any fact,
event or circumstance as to which Parent obtains knowledge that would be
reasonably likely to result in a failure of a condition set forth in Sections
6.2(a) or 6.2(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notification provided
under this Section 5.7 shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

5.8 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or in any agreement
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six years
from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provisions of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements
of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors,
officers or employees in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who
immediately before the Effective Time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided,
however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ ") pending or
asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase, and after the Effective
Time the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, directors and officers
liability insurance covering, for a period of six years after the Effective
Time, the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are
currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
before the Effective Time, on terms and conditions no less favorable to such
directors and officers than those in effect on the date of this Agreement;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to maintain directors and officers
liability insurance policies having aggregate annual premiums in excess of
250% of the per annum rate of premium currently paid by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such insurance on the date of this Agreement and in the event
the cost of such coverage shall exceed that amount, the Surviving Corporation
shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount; provided further,
however, that in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Parent may direct
the Company to purchase "tail" insurance coverage, at a cost no greater than
the aggregate amount which the Surviving Corporation would be permitted to
spend during the six-year period provided for in this Section 5.8(b), that
provides coverage no less favorable than the coverage described above.

 



 

(c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation or the purchaser of its assets and properties shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

 



 

5.9 _Publicity_.

 



 

Neither the Company, Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective affiliates
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consultation of the other
party (including giving the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such publication or the subject matter of such conferences, calls
or meetings), except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement
with a national securities exchange if all reasonable efforts have been made
to consult with the other party. In addition, the Company shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with Parent regarding the form and content of
any public disclosure of any material developments or matters involving the
Company, including earnings releases, reasonably in advance of publication or
release.

 



 

5.10 _Repayment of Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent copies of a payoff letter
(subject to delivery of funds as arranged by Parent), in commercially
reasonable form, from the administrative agent under the Company Credit
Agreement (the " _Administrative Agent_ "), and shall make arrangements for
the release of all liens and other security over the Companys and its
Subsidiaries properties and assets securing its obligations under the Company
Credit Agreement, together with the return of any collateral in the possession
of the Administrative Agent, at or as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time (subject to delivery of funds as arranged by Parent).

 



 

(b) Subject to the Companys compliance with Section 5.10(a), at or
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall arrange for delivery of
funds to the Administrative Agent sufficient to satisfy all obligations of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries under the Company Credit Agreement for
loans, extensions of credit, fees and expenses and any other amounts owed
under the Company Credit Agreement as of the Effective Time other than any
letters of credit with respect to which alternative collateral has been
provided.

 



 

(c) The Company hereby consents to Parents use of and reliance on any audited
or unaudited financial statements, including the financial statements of the
Company included in the SEC Documents, relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries reasonably requested by Parent to be used in any financing or
other activities of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including any filings that
Parent and its Subsidiaries desire to make with the SEC.

 



 

5.11 _Takeover Statute_.

 



 

If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent shall grant
such

 



      
 

 



 

approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

5.12 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) As used in this Section 5.12 the term " _Continuing Employees_ " shall
mean employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time who are employed by the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries immediately after the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Parent shall deem, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and Parents
other Subsidiaries to deem, Prior Service to have been employment and service
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or applicable Subsidiary for benefit
plan eligibility, vesting and accrual purposes for such employee benefit
plans, programs, policies or arrangements maintained by Parent or a Subsidiary
of Parent primarily for the benefit of its employees for which the Continuing
Employees are eligible to the extent service with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or applicable Subsidiary is recognized under any such plan,
program, policy or arrangement, provided that such service credit does not
result in a duplication of benefits. For purposes of this Section 5.12(b), "
_Prior Service_ " shall mean (i) the period of employment with the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries (and with predecessor employers with respect to which
the Company or its Subsidiaries shall have granted service credit), and (ii)
the period of uninterrupted employment with Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent
and any predecessor of any such entity if such employment ended immediately
prior to employment by the Company or a Subsidiary.

 



 

(c) Continuing Employees shall be eligible to receive benefits and enroll in
Parents employee benefit plans (" _Parent Plans_ ") on a basis consistent
with Parents applicable human resources policies. Such benefits and Parent
Plans shall provide substantially the same benefits in the aggregate as those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent from time to time. Until
such time that the Continuing Employees are provided benefits by Parent,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to maintain each
Company Plan in such form as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Each
Continuing Employee who continues as an employee of the Surviving Corporation
shall be eligible to continue to participate in the Company Plans in the same
manner and to the same extent as such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time until such Continuing Employees
enrollment in the Parent Plans. Upon enrollment in the Parent Plans, Parent
shall cause (i) the waiver of all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any welfare benefit
plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in on or after
Closing, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect
with respect to such employees under the Company Plans and that have not been
satisfied as of the date of enrollment in the Parent Plans, and (ii) provide
each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the date of enrollment in the Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Plans for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket
requirements under the Parent Plans for the year in which the Continuing
Employee becomes eligible to participate in the Parent Plans.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express
or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
Company Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement. In the event that
(i) a party other than the Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries
makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement
as an amendment to any Company Plan or other employee benefit plan or
arrangement, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such
Company Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement even though not
explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then such provision shall
lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect.

(i) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before December 31, 2012,
or such later date, if any, as Parent and the Company agree upon in writing
(the " _Termination Date_ "); provided that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to a party
whose failure to fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to have been
consummated on or before such date;

 



 

(ii) any Governmental Entity shall have issued a statute, rule, order, decree

terminating party, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to
the Closing (provided that the terminating party is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein); provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(iv) unless the breach
of representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would
entitle the party receiving such representation not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby under Section 6.3(a) (in the case of a breach
of representation or warranty by the Company) or Section 6.2(a) (in the case
of a breach of representation or warranty by Parent or Merger Sub); or

 



 

(v) there shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or

Business Days period shall be extended for an additional five (5)

 



      
 

 



 

Business Days following any material modification to such Acquisition Proposal
occurring after the receipt of Parents written request);

 



 

(iv) a tender offer or exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company is commenced, and the Company Board
fails to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer
by the stockholders of the Company within 10 Business Days after such
commencement (including by taking no position with respect to the acceptance
of such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the Company); or

 



 

(v) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective directors or
officers shall have breached in any material respect adverse to Parent any of
their respective obligations under Section 5.3; or

the other parties specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which
such termination is made, and except as provided in this Section 7.2, this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void after the expiration of any
applicable period following such notice. In the event of such termination,
there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company,
except as set forth in Section 8.1 of this Agreement and except with respect
to the requirement to comply with the Confidentiality Agreements; provided
that nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability or obligation
with respect to any fraud or willful breach of this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

MISCELLANEOUS

 



 

8.1 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses, except as
provided in Sections 8.1(b) and 8.1(c).

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or by
the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d), then the Company shall pay to

 



      
 

 



 

Parent in immediately available funds a termination fee in an amount equal to
the Termination Fee.

 



 

(c) In the event that (i) an Acquisition Proposal has been proposed by any
Person (other than Parent and Merger Sub or any of their respective
affiliates) or any Person has announced its intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal or such intention has otherwise
become known to the Companys directors or officers, or its stockholders
generally and (ii) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either the
Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or 7.1(b)(iii), then the
Company shall reimburse Parent for all of the Expenses of Parent and Merger
Sub. Furthermore, if (x) the events in clauses (i) and (ii) in the first
sentence of this Section 8.1(c) occur and (y) within 365 days after the
termination of this Agreement, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters
into any definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Transaction, or an
Acquisition Transaction is consummated, then the Company shall pay Parent the
Termination Fee (reduced by the amount of Expenses paid to Parent pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 8.1(c)) upon the first to occur of the
events described in clause (y) of this sentence.

 



 

(d) Any payment of the Expenses and the Termination Fee pursuant to Section
8.1(b) shall be made within five Business Days after termination of this
Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Parent. Any payment of the Expenses pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
shall be made upon the termination of this Agreement, and any payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.1(c) shall be made prior to the first to
occur of the execution of a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition
Transaction or the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction. In
circumstances where Section 8.1 requires a reimbursement of Expenses, the
Company shall reimburse Parent for the Expenses incurred to the date of
termination on the later of (i) the day that is one Business Day after the
date of termination and (ii) the day that is one Business Day after the
delivery by Parent to the Company of documents reflecting the Expenses
incurred. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.1 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor Merger Sub would enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay or cause to
be paid the amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.1, and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 8.1, the Company
shall pay to Parent and Merger Sub (as the case may be) its reasonable costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts
set forth in this Section 8.1 at the prime rate reported in the Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 



 

(e) For purposes of Sections 8.1(c) and 8.1(d), the term "Acquisition
Transaction" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.3(f)
except that all references to 20% therein shall be deemed to references to
50%.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) This Section 8.1 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. In no
event shall Parent be entitled to receive under this Article VIII an aggregate
amount equal to more than the Termination Fee.

 



 

8.2 _Amendment; Waiver_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this Agreement, by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time prior
to the Effective Time; provided, however, that after receipt of the Company
Required Vote, if any such amendment shall by applicable Law or in accordance
with the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market require further
approval of the stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such
amendment shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 



 

(b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties to this Agreement may
(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any
document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by the other party
or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the
other parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Any such waiver shall
constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such
writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such
waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of
the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of
this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more
occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise
any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other
breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such
provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. The rights and remedies herein
provided are cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights
or remedies that any party may otherwise have at Law or in equity.

 



 

8.3 _Survival_.

 



 

The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
certificates or other documents delivered prior to or as of the Effective Time
shall survive until (but not beyond) the Effective Time. ** **The covenants
and agreements of the parties hereto (including the Surviving Corporation
after the Merger) shall survive the Effective Time without limitation (except
for those which, by their terms, contemplate a shorter survival period) and
the covenants and agreements contained in this Article VIII and Sections 5.9
and 7.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
