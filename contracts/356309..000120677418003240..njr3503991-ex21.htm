(b) Buyer shall provide Seller and its representatives with reasonable access
during normal business hours to the relevant records, personnel and work
papers of Buyer and the ProjectCos used to prepare the Closing Statement to
assist in Seller's review of the Closing Statement and Buyer's proposed
calculations of Net Working Capital (Adjusted), Closing Indebtedness and
Adjusted Purchase Price set forth therein (collectively, the "Final
Calculations") as reasonably requested by Seller to assist with Seller's
review of the Closing Statement. If Seller disputes any of the Final
Calculations as calculated by Buyer and set forth on the Closing Statement,
within 30 days after Seller's receipt of Buyer's proposed Closing Statement
and Final Calculations, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written notice (a
"Notice of Dispute") setting forth in reasonable detail any changes or
adjustments that Seller proposes to make to the Closing Statement or the Final
Calculations. Seller's failure to deliver a Notice of Dispute by the
expiration of such 30 day period shall be deemed an acceptance by Seller of
the Closing Statement and the Final Calculations as submitted by Buyer.

  

(c) In the event that Seller delivers to Buyer a Notice of Dispute, Buyer and
Seller shall promptly consult and cooperate with each other in good faith with
respect to the specified points of disagreement in an effort to resolve the
dispute and upon such resolution, if any, any adjustments to the Closing
Statement or Final Calculations shall be made as agreed upon by Seller and
Buyer in writing. If any such dispute cannot be resolved by Buyer and Seller
within 30 calendar days after Buyer receives the Notice of Dispute, Buyer and
Seller shall jointly refer the dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm, as
an expert to finally resolve, as soon as practicable, and in any event within
45 calendar days after such reference, all remaining points of disagreement
stated in the Notice of Dispute with respect to the Final Calculations
reflected on the Closing Statement. For purposes of making such determination,
each of Seller and Buyer shall submit a proposed calculation of the Final
Calculations and a written presentation in support of their respective
calculations (each, a "Submission"). Each Party's Submission must (i) in the
case of Buyer, be consistent with (including as to the line items included and
amounts stated for each line item) the Closing Statement and (ii) in the case
of Seller, be consistent with the Notice of Dispute (including as to the line
items included and amounts stated for each line item); _provided_ , that the
foregoing may be modified to the extent provided in any written agreement of
Buyer and Seller to reflect the resolution of any dispute prior to submission
to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm (i) shall
apply the terms of this _Section 2.4_ , (ii) may not assign a value to any
item greater than the highest value claimed for such item or less than the
lowest value claimed for such item by either Buyer or Seller in such Party's
Submission, (iii) shall restrict its decision to such items included in the
Notice of Dispute which are then in dispute, and (iv) subject to the
immediately following sentence, may review only (x) the terms of this
Agreement and (y) the Submissions of Buyer and Seller provided pursuant to the
following sentence in resolving any matter which is in dispute. Buyer and
Seller shall each furnish the Independent Accounting Firm with such work
papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as
the Independent Accounting Firm shall request, and, subject to _Section 5.2_ ,
shall provide copies to the other Party of any work papers, documents and
information so furnished to the Independent Accounting Firm. Each of the
Parties shall bear its own expenses in connection with producing its
Submission and preparing and conducting the review by the Independent
Accounting Firm; _provided_ , that the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm incurred in connection with the review of the Closing
Statement and the Final Calculations shall be allocated between Buyer and
Seller by the Independent Accounting Firm in proportion to the extent either
of such Parties did not prevail on items in dispute with respect to the Final
Calculations reflected on the Closing Statement; _provided_ , that such fees
and expenses so allocated shall not include, so long as a Party complies with
the procedures of this Section, the other Party's outside counsel or
accounting fees. All determinations by the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be final, conclusive and binding with respect to the Final Calculations and
the allocation of expert fees and expenses, in the absence of fraud or
manifest error. The earliest to occur of (i) the date upon which an agreement
between Buyer and Seller with respect to the Final Calculations is reached,
(ii) 30 days following the date the Closing Statement is delivered, if Seller
fails to deliver a Notice of Dispute by such date and (iii) receipt of the
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section
2.4(c)_ is herein called the "Final Settlement Date." The Adjusted Purchase
Price calculated using the Net Working Capital (Adjusted) and Closing
Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ is referred
to herein as the "Final Purchase Price."

     

(d) If the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Final Purchase Price,
then Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such difference, within ten (10)
Business Days after the Final Settlement Date. If the Estimated Purchase Price
is less than the Final Purchase Price, then Buyer shall pay to Seller the
amount of such difference, within ten (10) Business Days after the Final
Settlement Date. Unless otherwise agreed, payment shall be made by wire
transfer in immediately available funds.

  

ARTICLE III 
 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER_

in which case such representation and warranty shall be deemed to be made only
as of such date):

  

3.1 _Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power_.

  

(a) Seller is a corporation organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of New Jersey, and has all requisite corporate
power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted. Seller is
duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership of the Membership Interests makes such qualification or licensing
necessary.

  

(b) Each ProjectCo is a limited liability company duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of formation, and is
duly licensed or qualified to transact business, and is in good standing in
all states in which it conducts business or is otherwise required to be so
duly licensed or qualified. Each ProjectCo has all requisite limited liability
company power and authority to own, use and operate its Project.

  

3.2 _Authority, Execution, Enforceability_. Seller has the requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all other agreements,
instruments and documents to be executed and delivered by Seller hereunder or
in connection herewith, and to consummate the Transaction. The execution and
delivery by Seller and the ProjectCos, as applicable, of this Agreement and
all other agreements, instruments and documents to be executed and delivered
by Seller or the ProjectCos hereunder or in connection herewith and the
performance by each of Seller and the ProjectCos of its obligations hereunder
and thereunder have been duly and validly authorized by all appropriate action
in accordance with the organizational and governing documents of Seller and
the ProjectCos (as applicable) and applicable Law. This Agreement and all
other agreements, instruments and documents which have been executed and
delivered by Seller or the ProjectCos hereunder or in connection herewith have
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller and (as applicable) the
ProjectCos and, assuming valid execution and delivery by Buyer or any other
applicable unaffiliated counterparty, constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of Seller enforceable against Seller in accordance with their
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general application
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and by general
equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

     

3.3 _No Conflict_. Subject to obtaining Seller's Required Consents and Buyer
providing the Replacement Credit Support, except as set forth in _Disclosure
Schedule 3.3_ , neither the execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement
or any other agreement, instrument or document to be executed and delivered by
Seller hereunder or in connection herewith, nor its compliance with any
provision hereof or thereof, nor its consummation of the Transaction will,
directly or indirectly:

  

(a) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provisions of the
Organizational Documents of Seller or any ProjectCo;

  

(b) result in a material default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, or acceleration) under, or materially conflict with, any of the
terms, conditions, or provisions of, any Material Contract, material Permit or
other material obligation to which Seller or any ProjectCo is a party or by
which the Membership Interests or any ProjectCo may be bound, except for such
defaults (or rights of termination or acceleration) as to which requisite
waivers or consents have been, or prior to the Closing will have been,
obtained, or which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in an adverse effect on any ProjectCo or any Project or
Seller's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement;

  

(c) conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any term or provision
of any Law or Order applicable to Seller, any ProjectCo or any of their
respective assets, in any material respect; or

  

(d) result in the creation of a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on the
assets of any ProjectCo.

  

3.4 _Ownership of Membership Interests_. Seller owns beneficially and of
record good title to the Membership Interests, free and clear of all Liens,
except for Permitted Equity Liens. The Membership Interests have been validly
issued and outstanding and are fully paid and nonassessable and were not
issued in violation of the preemptive rights of any Person. There are no
voting agreements with respect to the Membership Interests or other agreements
restricting the right of Seller to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the
Membership Interests. This Agreement, together with the other documents
executed and delivered at Closing by Seller, will be effective to transfer
valid title to the Membership Interests to Buyer upon the Closing, free and
clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Equity Liens.

     

3.5 _Capitalization of ProjectCos_. The Membership Interests constitute all of
the membership interests and other equity interests in each ProjectCo. Except
as provided in the applicable ProjectCo's Organizational Documents or in
_Disclosure Schedule 3.5_ , (a) there are no outstanding or authorized
options, warrants, rights, subscriptions, claims of any character, agreements,
obligations, convertible or exchangeable securities, or other commitments,
contingent or otherwise, relating to the Membership Interests pursuant to
which any ProjectCo is or may become obligated to issue membership interests
or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right
to subscribe for, equity interests of any ProjectCo; and (b) there are no
outstanding agreements affecting or relating to the voting, issuance,
purchase, redemption, repurchase or transfer of the Membership Interests or
any securities convertible or exchangeable for the Membership Interests or any
other securities of any ProjectCo.

  

3.6 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for the consent and approvals set forth
in _Disclosure Schedule 3.6_ (the "Seller's Required Consents"), no consent,
approval or action of, filing with or notice to, any Governmental Authority or
other Person on the part of Seller or any ProjectCo is required in connection
with the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement or any other
agreement, instrument or document to be executed and delivered by Seller or
any ProjectCo hereunder or in connection herewith, or the consummation of the
Transaction by Seller, except where the failure to obtain such consent or
approval would not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, an
adverse effect on any ProjectCo or any Project.

  

3.7 _Brokers_. Except with respect to Marathon Capital, LLC, all negotiations
relating to this Agreement and the Transaction on behalf of Seller have been
carried on by Seller in such a manner as not to give rise to any valid claim
against Buyer (by reason of any of Seller's actions) or any ProjectCo for a
brokerage commission, finder's fee, or other like payment to any Person.
Seller assumes full responsibility for all commissions, fees and other
payments owed to Marathon Capital, LLC in connection with the services
provided by it to Seller in connection with this Agreement and the
Transaction, and none of such commissions, fees and other payments have been
paid or incurred by any ProjectCo.

, there is no claim, action, proceeding, or investigation pending against or,
to Seller's Knowledge, threatened against or relating to Seller (in respect of
any ProjectCo or Project), the Membership Interests, or any ProjectCo or any
ProjectCo's assets by or before any Governmental Authority or other Person,
which could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result, or has resulted, in (i) a material impairment of Seller's ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Transaction;
or (ii) an adverse effect on any ProjectCo or any Project. There is no
indemnity claim against or relating to Seller (in respect of any ProjectCo or
Project) or any ProjectCo under any Contract to which any ProjectCo is a party
that is pending or threatened in writing to Seller (or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, otherwise) against or affecting any ProjectCo, its business or its
properties or assets. Except as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule 3.8_ , there
is no unsatisfied judgment, penalty or award against Seller (in respect of any
ProjectCo or Project) or any ProjectCo affecting its assets or properties. To
Seller's Knowledge, there is no proceeding or Liability that could be made,
brought, asserted or initiated by any ProjectCo that will be released,
acquitted or discharged pursuant to _Section 5.13(b)_.

extent that noncompliance could not reasonably be expected to restrain,
enjoin, or otherwise prohibit or make illegal the Transaction. Neither Seller
nor any ProjectCo has received any written notice regarding any material
violation of, conflict with or failure to conduct its business in material
compliance with any Law that has not been resolved. Seller is not making any
representation or warranty in this Section with respect to any litigation,
environmental or Tax matters as to any ProjectCo or its Project, and such

prepared in accordance with the GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods covered thereby and present fairly the financial condition of the
ProjectCos as of such dates and the results of operations and changes in
financial position of the ProjectCos for such periods; _provided_ _,_ that the

as result of a breach or default thereunder), (ii) Liabilities specifically
reflected on or adequately reserved against in the Financial Statements, (iii)
Liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business after the Balance Sheet

3.16 _Absence of Changes_. Except as set forth _Disclosure Schedule 3.16_ ,
since the Balance Sheet Date, the ProjectCos have conducted their business and
operated the Projects in the ordinary course of business and consistent with
past practice and there has not been any event, change, occurrence or
circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate with any such events,
changes, occurrences or circumstances, has had or could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, since the Balance Sheet Date, except as set forth on _Disclosure
Schedule 3.16_ , the ProjectCos and, with respect to the Projects, Seller,
have not taken any action that would be deemed to be a breach of _Section 5.4_
if such action occurred between the Execution Date and the Closing Date.

  

3.17 _No Subsidiaries_. None of the ProjectCos owns or holds (and none of the
ProjectCos has ever owned or held), directly or indirectly, any equity or
other ownership interest in any Person.

maintained by each ProjectCo with a bank or other financial institution
(including, as of the Closing Date, the New Accounts). As of the Closing Date,
the counterparties to all Material Contracts and all other Persons from whom
payments, reimbursements and other obligations or liabilities are due or owed,
or are reasonably likely to become due or owed after Closing, have been
notified in writing that any revenues, payments, reimbursements, liabilities
and other amounts so due or owed shall be paid into the applicable New
Account, and not into any account of Seller, any of its Affiliates or any
other Person.

  

3.21 _Insurance_. _Disclosure Schedule 3.21_ lists all insurance policies
currently in effect with respect to each ProjectCo and its Project. A summary
of such insurance policies has been made available to Buyer. Each such
insurance policy is valid and binding and in full force and effect and,
subject to payment of annual premiums, will continue in full force and effect
until Closing. Each ProjectCo has, to Seller's Knowledge, maintained and
maintains all insurance policies then required to be maintained by it under
the applicable Material Contracts. With respect to events and circumstances
occurring on and prior to the Closing Date: (a) Seller's rights to recover
under such insurance policies with respect to the Projects and ProjectCos will
continue in full force and effect following Closing, and (b) such insurance
policies allow for Seller to recover insurance proceeds following the Closing
for covered losses with respect to ProjectCos and the Projects. No premiums
due thereunder have not been paid and neither Seller nor any ProjectCo has
received any written notice of cancellation or termination in respect of any
such policy or is in default thereunder. Neither Seller nor any ProjectCo has
received written notice that any insurer under any policy referred to in this
Section is denying liability with respect to a claim thereunder or defending
under a reservation of rights clause. Other than as set forth on _Disclosure
Schedule 3.21_ , there are no pending claims under such insurance policies
against or relating to the ProjectCos or the Projects, or, to Seller's
Knowledge, events or circumstances that are reasonably likely to give rise to
such claims.

  

3.22 _Bankruptcy_. There are no bankruptcy, reorganization, or arrangement
proceedings pending against, being contemplated by, or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened against, Seller or any ProjectCo.

  

3.23 _Employees; Benefit Plan Liabilities_. No ProjectCo has, or has ever had,

preserve such benefits.

 

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause each of the ProjectCos to, cooperate with
Buyer, as Buyer reasonably may request, to ensure that, upon the Closing, the
ProjectCos have in place insurance in such form and amounts as reasonably

5.6 _Real Property Interests_.

and the Surveys prior to signing this Agreement and that it accepts those
matters, documents and exceptions identified therein as Permitted Liens.

 

(b) Seller shall (i) cause the applicable title company, within forty-five
(45) days prior to the Closing, to either issue a new title commitment or
update the existing title commitment (in either case, the "Title Report
Updates"), and to provide the best available copies of all exceptions,
documents, and other matters included on the Title Report Updates that are not
reflected in the Title Reports ("New Exceptions").

 

(c) If (A) the Title Report Updates include any New Exceptions, then Buyer
shall have the right to object to any such New Exceptions by written notice to
Seller within ten (10) Business Days following the date of receipt by Buyer of
the applicable Title Report Update. If Buyer does not so object within such
10-Business Day period, then such New Exceptions shall be deemed waived by
Buyer.

    

(d) If any New Exceptions are objected to by Buyer within such 10-Business Day
period (the "Objections"), then Seller and the applicable ProjectCo shall use
reasonable efforts to cure the Objections within ten (10) Business Days after
Seller's receipt of the Objections. Buyer acknowledges that any Objection that
is susceptible to cure by the payment of money shall in any event constitute a
Permitted Lien if, on or before the Closing, Seller (i) bonds over such
Objection in accordance with applicable Law or otherwise in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the applicable title company and the applicable
title company agrees to insure over such Objection, or (ii) furnishes a letter
of credit (in form, and from a bank, reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) in an
amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the amount claimed by the
underlying claimant and the applicable title company agrees to insure over
such Objection. If applicable, the letter of credit described in clause (ii)
above will remain in place until Seller has cured such Objection or satisfies
the requirements of clause (i); _provided_ , _however_ , if Seller has not
released, cured or satisfied such Objection or satisfied the requirements of
clause (i) or (ii) above as of the earlier of (x) the date which is twelve
(12) months following the Closing, or (y) the date which is ten (10) Business
Days following the commencement of an action by such claimant to foreclose or
enforce such encumbrance, Buyer may apply such security towards satisfying the
claim (including costs of investigation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the
costs or expenses to which such claimant may be entitled), and including any
additional Losses incurred by any ProjectCo or Buyer with respect to such
Objection, and after satisfaction of all of the foregoing, with the remainder,
if any, returned to Seller.

 

(e) If any Objection with respect to any of the Alexander Project, the Carroll
Project or the Ringer Hill Project, or any Objection with respect to the
Medicine Bow Project that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect, is not cured within 10-Business Days after Seller's receipt of
the Objections then, within three (3) Business Days after the expiration of
such 10-Business Day period, Buyer shall deliver to Seller its written
election to either (i) waive any uncured Objections and proceed to Closing or
(ii) terminate this Agreement.

 

(f) At or prior to Closing, Seller shall, at Buyer's expense (including the
premium, costs of the application and any further surveys of the Real Property
Interest required by the insurance company), obtain title insurance policies
covering the Projects on such terms and with such coverages, deletion of the
standard exceptions, and endorsements as it is able to obtain from the title
companies. At or prior to Closing, Seller and ProjectCos shall deliver any
documents, affidavits, indemnities or other instruments, including a standard
owner's affidavit, non-imputation affidavit, and copies of organizational
documents and authorizing resolutions, reasonably required by the application
title insurance company to permit issuance to Buyer of ALTA extended coverage
owner's title insurance policies (the "Title Policies") at Closing, insuring
the ProjectCos' title to the Real Property Interests, which Title Policies
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

 

5.7 _Condemnation; Casualty_.

 

(a) If, before the Closing Date, all or any portion of a Project becomes
subject to or is threatened with any condemnation or eminent domain
proceeding, Seller shall notify Buyer promptly in writing of such fact. If
such taking would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect (but for the proviso in clause (H) of such definition), then Buyer may,
at its option, (i) elect to receive any condemnation awards or other amounts
received by Seller or the applicable ProjectCo in connection with such
proceedings, or (ii) terminate this Agreement prior to Closing by written
notice to Seller within ten (10) days following the receipt of such notice
from Seller.

     

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, a Project is
damaged or destroyed (whether by fire, theft, vandalism, terrorist act or
other casualty) in whole or in part, then:

 

(i) If the cost of repair or replacement of such damage is equal to or less
than $4,000,000, Seller shall, at Seller's option, elect to either (A) to pay
to Buyer when received any insurance proceeds received by Seller or the
applicable ProjectCo in connection therewith and proceed with the Transaction;
or (B) bear the costs of repairing or restoring such damage or destruction to
no less favorable condition than existed prior to such damage or destruction
and, at Seller's election, delay the Closing and any right to terminate this
Agreement for a reasonable time necessary to accomplish the same.

 

(ii) If the cost of repair or replacement of such damage is greater than
$4,000,000, then Buyer may elect to either (x) receive all insurance proceeds
which the applicable ProjectCo may be entitled under its property insurance
and proceed with the Transaction; or (y) terminate this Agreement prior to
Closing by written notice to Seller within ten (10) days following the
determination of the fair market value of such damage or destruction and the
cost of repair by a qualified firm reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and
Seller.

 

5.8 _Records_.

Date all records possessed or to be possessed by such Party relating to each
ProjectCo and the Projects, unless such Party shall first offer by notice to
the other Party to surrender such books, records and other data to the other
Party and such other Party does not agree in writing to take possession
thereof during the ten day period after such offer is made. After the Closing
Date until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, each Party shall
provide the other Party, its counsel and its accountants, cooperation and
access, upon prior reasonable written request specifying the need therefor,
during regular business hours, to such records except where such access would
violate any Law, and such Party shall have the right to make copies of such
records at its sole cost, to the extent that such cooperation and access may
be reasonably required by the requesting Party in connection with (i)
compliance with the requirements of any Governmental Authority or (ii) any
actual or threatened investigation, claim, proceeding or cause of action.

 

5.9 _Removal of Name_. As promptly as practicable after Closing, but in any
case within 30 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall eliminate the names
"NJR Clean Energy Ventures" and/or "New Jersey Resources" and Seller's logo
and any variants thereof from the Project assets and, except with respect to
such grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to use
any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its
Affiliates.

     

5.10 _Ringer Hill Interconnection True-Up and Contractor Payment_. In

Hill Project, Ringer Hill ProjectCo or Seller paid certain deposits toward the
costs of the High Point Substation to or for the benefit of Somerset Rural
Electric Cooperative, Inc., Pennsylvania Electric Company and PJM
Interconnection L.L.C., and Ringer Hill ProjectCo will be owed a
reimbursement, from such deposited funds, to the extent such deposited funds
exceed such costs (the "Ringer Hill Refund"). Unless such refund is paid to
Seller previously, at or prior to Closing Ringer Hill ProjectCo shall, subject
to the rights of any applicable counterparty to a Material Contract, assign
all of its rights to the Ringer Hill Refund to Seller and Seller shall
thereafter be entitled to receive the Ringer Hill Refund. Following Closing,
Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to, and shall cause Ringer
Hill ProjectCo to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to, cooperate with
Seller in connection with determining the amount of the Ringer Hill Refund and
the collection thereof. Further, with regard to the payment due by Ringer Hill
Project pursuant to the contract set forth in _Schedule 3.15(b)_ , Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such payment is made
in full to the counterparty prior to the Closing. If such payment is not made
prior to the Closing, Seller agrees to make such payment directly to the
counterparty promptly upon request by the Buyer.

  

5.11 _Termination of Intercompany Arrangements; Credit Support_. Seller shall
take all actions necessary to cause all arrangements, understandings or
Contracts, including all obligations to provide goods, services or other
benefits, by Seller and/or any of its Affiliates (other than a ProjectCo), on
the one hand, and the ProjectCos, on the other hand, to be terminated,
effective as of the Closing, without any party having any continuing
obligations or liability to the other and waiving, releasing and forever
discharging any such liabilities, except for this Agreement and the documents
to be executed hereunder.

  

5.12 _Exclusivity_. Prior to the earlier of the Closing or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and except with respect to this
Agreement and the Transaction, Seller agrees that, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, it will not, and will cause the ProjectCos, and the Related

or the making or implementation of any proposal or offer with respect to a

_Section 7.1(c)_ or _(d)_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become wholly void
and of no further force and effect and there shall be no liability on the part
of Seller or Buyer hereunder; _provided_ , that the provisions of _Section
5.2_ , this _Section 7.2_ and _Article X_ shall survive any such termination
of this Agreement; _provided further_ , that nothing contained in this

ARTICLE VIII 
 _TAX MATTERS_

  

8.1 _Filing of Tax Returns_.

  

(a) For Tax Returns that apply to the activities of each ProjectCo for periods
ending on or before the Closing Date but that are not filed as of the Closing,
Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file, or cause to be
timely filed, all such Tax Returns, if any.

  

(b) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file, or cause to
be timely filed, all Tax Returns of each ProjectCo, if any, for all taxable
periods (or portions thereof) which begin on or before, and end after, the
Closing Date (such portion of a tax period beginning before and ending on the
Closing Date being the ("Pre-Closing Period"). Buyer shall permit Seller a
reasonable amount of time to review and comment on each such Tax Return
described in the preceding sentence prior to filing. Buyer shall timely remit,
or cause to be timely remitted, all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.
Seller shall pay to Buyer, within ten days following any written demand by
Buyer (which demand shall include a computation of the amount owed by Seller),
with respect to each such Tax Return, an amount equal to the portion of the
Taxes due in respect of such Tax Return which relates to a Pre-Closing Period
to the extent such Taxes were not taken into account in determining the Final
Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not
apply to Tax Returns relating to federal, state and local income Taxes.

  

(c) Buyer shall not amend, refile or otherwise modify, or cause or permit to
be amended, refiled or otherwise modified, any Tax Return filed by or with
respect to the activities of each ProjectCo that includes any Pre-Closing
Period or any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date without prior
written notice to Seller.

  

(d) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall each cause its respective Affiliates to,
provide to the other Party such cooperation and information, as and to the
extent reasonably requested, in connection with (i) preparing, reviewing or
filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund of each
ProjectCo, (ii) determining Liabilities for Taxes or a right to refund of
Taxes of each ProjectCo or (iii) conducting any audit or other action with
respect to Taxes of each ProjectCo, in the case of clauses (i) through (iii),
with respect to each ProjectCo. Buyer shall file Internal Revenue Service Form
8822-B "Change of Address for Responsible Party-Business." Upon Buyer's
request, Seller shall provide Buyer with the information that is required to
complete such Form.

        

8.2 _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. For all purposes of this Agreement:

  

(a) If each ProjectCo is permitted but not required under applicable U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. income Tax laws to treat the Closing Date as
the last day of a taxable period, then the Parties shall treat that day as the
last day of a taxable period.

  

(b) In the case of Taxes for a taxable period of each ProjectCo that includes,
but does not end on, the Closing Date, except as provided in _Section 8.2(c)_
, the allocation of such Taxes between the Pre-Closing Period and the period
beginning the day after the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Period") shall be
made on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of the end of the
Closing Date.

  

(c) In the case of any Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real
property or personal property Taxes) that are payable for a taxable period
that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax
which relates to the Pre-Closing Period shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period. However, any such
Taxes attributable to any property that was owned by any ProjectCo at some
point in the Pre-Closing Period, but is not owned as of or after the Closing
Date shall be allocated entirely to the Pre-Closing Period, and any such Taxes
attributable to any property that was not owned by any ProjectCo at any point
in the Pre-Closing Period shall be allocated entirely to the Post-Closing
Period.

  

8.3 _Carryovers, Refunds, and Related Matters_.

  

(a) Any refund, rebate, abatement, reduction or other recovery (whether direct
or indirect through a right of set-off or credit) of Taxes (including any
interest thereon) (a "Tax Refund") that relates to each ProjectCo that is
attributable to a Post-Closing Period shall be the property of each ProjectCo
and shall be retained by each ProjectCo (or promptly paid by Seller to each
ProjectCo if any such Tax Refund is received by Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller).

  

(b) Any Tax Refund that relates to each ProjectCo that is attributable to a
Pre-Closing Period shall be the property of Seller and shall be retained by
Seller (or promptly paid by each ProjectCo or Buyer to Seller if any such Tax
Refund is received by each ProjectCo or Buyer or any of their Affiliates).

  

(c) In applying _Sections 8.3(a)_ and _(b)_ , any Tax Refund for a taxable
period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date shall be allocated
between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period in accordance with
the principles of _Sections 8.2(b)_ and _(c)_.

       

8.4 _Audits_. Buyer shall notify Seller regarding, and within 30 days after,
the receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including each ProjectCo) of
notice of any material inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar
events with respect to Taxes of or with respect to each ProjectCo to the
extent relating to any Pre-Closing Period. If such notice relates solely to
Taxes for which Seller is responsible under this Agreement, Seller shall
control the resolution of any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or
event. Otherwise, Buyer shall control the resolution of any such inquiry,
claim, assessment, audit or event; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if the
notice relates in part to Taxes for which Seller is responsible, Buyer shall
consult with Seller regarding the resolution of such Taxes and shall not
agree to any settlement of any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or
event relating in part to Taxes for which Seller is responsible without the
written consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

8.5 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that
Buyer's acquisition of the Membership Interests will be treated as the
acquisition by Buyer of all of the assets of each ProjectCo for U.S. federal
Tax income purposes. The Base Purchase Price (including any liabilities that
are deemed to be assumed by purchaser for U.S. federal income Tax purposes)
shall be allocated among the Project assets in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code. Buyer and Seller will use such allocation of the Base Purchase Price
as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for purposes of all
required Tax Returns (including any Tax Returns required to be filed under
Section 1060(b) of the Code and the treasury regulations thereunder). The
allocation of the Base Purchase Price may change after the Closing Date as a
result of any adjustment to the Base Purchase Price. Any change to the
allocation of the Base Purchase Price following the Closing Date shall be as
agreed to in good faith by the Parties, set forth in writing and executed by
the Parties. The Parties will each report the federal, state and local and
other Tax consequences of the purchase and sale contemplated hereby (including
the filing of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in a manner consistent with
the foregoing allocation.

  

8.6 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer will be liable for any Transfer Taxes imposed on
the transfer of the Membership Interests to Buyer.

(iii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of all Losses for which Seller is

regarding a claim that relates to the period after the Effective Time.

     

9.3 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary and subject to the following sentence, the indemnification
obligations of the Parties contained in this _Article IX_ (and subject to the
other limitations in this Agreement) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Parties, their Affiliates, successors and assigns with respect to any and
all claims for Losses sustained or incurred arising out of or relating to any
breach of any representation or warranty in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ , or
any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, including any claims
with respect to environmental, health and safety matters, or any aspect of the
Transaction; and each Party hereby expressly waives and disclaims, and agrees
that it shall not assert, any right, remedy (including the remedy of
rescission) or claim in respect of any such breach or Losses based on any
cause or form of action whatsoever (whether contractual, statutory, in tort or
otherwise), except as and to the extent permitted in this _Article IX_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Parties may seek to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement by injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief (and the Parties intend that each Party has the right to
specific performance of the other Party's obligations to tender performance of
its obligations at Closing) as provided in _Article VII_ , and (ii) either
Party may seek any and all judicial relief with respect to any default by the
other Party of any of its obligations to pay any amounts due and owing to such
Party under this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 9.3_ is intended to
constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights that any Party (or their
respective Affiliates) may have to assert claims against third parties. Any
claim made, asserted or brought by any Party or other Person pursuant to
_Section 9.1_ or _9.2_ before the expiration of the applicable survival period
set forth in such _Section 9.1_ or _9.2_ shall survive until the final
resolution of such claim.

  

9.4 _Insurance Recoveries_. Losses for which any Indemnified Party will be
reimbursed hereunder will be decreased by insurance proceeds or payments from
any other responsible parties actually received by such Indemnified Party
(after taking into account any increases in premium and deducting costs and
expenses incurred in connection with recovery of such proceeds).
Notwithstanding anything set forth in this _Article IX_ to the contrary, with
respect to any indemnifiable Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties under
_Section 9.1_ , (a) the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
recover insurance proceeds with respect to such Losses from the insurance
policies of the Seller and its Affiliates in effect for the period prior to
the Closing, and (b) the aggregate amount of such proceeds actually received
by the Seller or its Affiliates from third parties with respect to such Losses
(less any costs of collection and increases in premium) shall be paid to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties promptly upon receipt.

  

9.5 _Tax Treatment_. Any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement
will be treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price solely for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

9.6 _Reliance_. Seller and Buyer each acknowledge that (i) only
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements expressly made in this
Agreement will be deemed to be representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements for purposes of this Agreement, and (ii) neither Party has relied
or will rely on any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement not
expressly made in this Agreement in consummating the Transaction.

     

9.7 _Limitation on Indemnification_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article IX_ to the extent any Losses were attributable to such Indemnified
Party's own bad faith, fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct.

  

(b) The Parties are in agreement that where the same set of facts qualifies
under more than one provision entitling Buyer or Seller to a claim or remedy
under this Agreement, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall only be entitled
to be indemnified once in respect of such set of facts and shall not be
entitled to double recovery hereunder.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no liability,
obligation, contract or other matter shall constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller or entitle the Buyer to indemnification
hereunder:

  

(i) to the extent that the liability, obligation, contract or other matter was
included or taken into account in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price;
and

  

(ii) if the liability is for Taxes payable with respect to any Tax period or
portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date.

  

9.8 _Limitation on Losses_. SUBJECT TO THE NEXT SENTENCE, IN NO EVENT SHALL
EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECULATIVE
OR INDIRECT LOSSES OR DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITIES OR LOST TAX BENEFITS (IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) UNDER OR
IN RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT. THE FOREGOING EXCLUSION SHALL NOT PRECLUDE
RECOVERY (I) TO THE EXTENT THAT INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN RESPECT OF
THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS COULD BE DEEMED TO BE LIMITED BY THE FOREGOING OR (II) IN
RESPECT OF CLAIMS FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST PTC CREDITS THAT ARE IN EACH CASE
THE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF A BREACH OR INACCURACY OF A
REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT, AGREEMENT OR OBLIGATION HEREUNDER.

  

9.9 _Mitigation_. The Indemnified Party will take all Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to mitigate all Losses, including availing itself of any defenses,
limitations, rights of contribution, claims against third Persons and other
rights at law or equity, and will provide such evidence and documentation of
the nature and extent of the Losses as may be reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party's reasonable steps include the
reasonable expenditure of money to mitigate or otherwise reduce or eliminate
any Losses for which indemnification would otherwise be due under this
_Article IX_.

     

9.10 _Procedure for Indemnification_.

  

(a) _Third Party Claims_.

  

(i) _Notice._ Whenever any claim by a third party shall arise for
indemnification under this _Article IX_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim and, when known, the facts
constituting the basis for such claim and, if known, the notice shall specify
the amount or an estimate of the amount of the liability arising therefrom.
The Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party copies of all
material notices and documents (including court papers) received or
transmitted by the Indemnified Party relating to such claim. The failure or
delay of the Indemnified Party to deliver prompt written notice of a claim
shall not affect the indemnity obligations of the Indemnifying Party
hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party was actually
disadvantaged by such failure or delay in delivery of notice of such claim.

  

(ii) _Settlement of Losses_. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense
of any claim by a third party which may give rise to indemnity hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall not settle, consent to the entry of a judgment of or
compromise such claim without the prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Indemnifying Party.

  

(b) _Rights of Indemnifying Party in the Defense of Third Party Claims_.

  

(i) _Right to Assume the Defense_. In connection with any claim by a third
party which may give rise to indemnity hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall
have thirty (30) days after the date the Indemnifying Party is notified of
such claim by the Indemnified Party to assume the defense of any such claim,
which defense shall be prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final
conclusion or settlement in accordance with the terms hereof.

  

(ii) _Procedure_. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such
claim, the Indemnifying Party shall (i) select counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such claim and (ii) take
all steps necessary in the defense or settlement thereof, at its sole cost and
expense. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not
control) the defense of any such claim, with its own counsel and at its sole
cost and expense; _provided_ , that, if the claim includes allegations for
which the Indemnifying Party both would and would not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall in that case jointly assume the defense thereof. The Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall fully cooperate with each other and
their respective counsel in the defense or settlement of such claim. The Party
in charge of the defense shall keep the other Party appraised at all times as
to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect
thereto.

     

(iii) _Settlement of Losses_. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a
settlement of or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim or
legal proceeding, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
unless (A) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full
by the Indemnifying Party and (B) the Indemnified Party will have no Liability
with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claim or legal
proceeding.

  

(iv) _Decline to Assume the Defense_. The Indemnified Party may defend against
any such claim, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, in
such manner as it may deem reasonably appropriate, including settling such
claim in accordance with the terms hereof if (i) the Indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense of any such claim resulting therefrom within thirty
(30) days after the date the Indemnifying Party is notified of such claim by
the Indemnified Party or (ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that
the Indemnifying Party is (A) not diligently defending the Indemnified Party,
(B) not contesting such claim in good faith through appropriate proceedings or
(C) has not taken such action (including the posting of a bond, deposit or
other security) as may be necessary to prevent any action to foreclose a Lien
against or attachment of any asset or property of the Indemnified Party for
payment of such claim.

  

(c) _Direct Claims_. In the event that any Indemnified Party has a claim
against any Indemnifying Party which may give rise to indemnity hereunder that
does not involve a claim brought by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim and the facts constituting
the basis for such claim and, if known, the amount or an estimate of the
amount of the liability arising therefrom. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days from receipt of such claim notice
that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, the amount of such claim
shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder;
however if the Indemnifying Party does notify the Indemnified Party that it
disputes such claim within the require 30 day period, the Parties shall
attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective Parties with
respect to such claim. If the Parties should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both Parties. If such
Parties shall not agree, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to take any
action in law or in equity as such Indemnified Party shall deem necessary to
enforce the provisions of this _Article IX_ against the Indemnifying Party.

contemplated by this Agreement and no permitted public announcement or
statement shall identify the other Party by name; _provided_ _, however_ , if
a Party is required to make such public announcement or statement, or identify
the other Party by name in such announcement or statement, by law or under the
rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (or other public stock
exchange of similar reputation and standing) on which the shares of such Party
or any of its Affiliates are listed, then the same may be made without the
approval of the other Party. The opinion of counsel of the Party making such
announcement or statement shall be conclusive evidence of such requirement by
law or rules or regulations.

10.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement to be performed at

shall nominate one executive representative with the authority to bind such
Party. The nominated representatives shall meet not later than ten Business
Days thereafter to attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute and to produce
written terms of settlement for the dispute. Such a settlement agreement
executed by each executive representative shall serve as conclusive evidence
of the resolution of such dispute. If the executive representatives do not
produce and execute such a settlement agreement within 45 days after the date
of the first meeting or within a longer period agreed to by each executive
representative, then, either Party may upon written notice to the other Party,
pursue all its rights and remedies provided at law or equity or otherwise in
this Agreement.

State of New York and (b) the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, with respect to any suit, action or other proceeding

(including any claim to enforce the expert determination provisions of this
Agreement) or any document or instrument delivered at Closing. Each of the
Parties agrees to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating hereto in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or if
such suit, action or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for
jurisdictional reasons, in the state courts located in the State of New York.
Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to
the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (i) the state courts
located in the State of New York or (ii) the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum or to raise any similar defense or objection. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED ON, OR ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY AGREEMENT
CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN CONJUNCTION HEREWITH, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT,
COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY
PARTY. THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE PARTIES ENTERING INTO
THIS AGREEMENT.

to the benefit of, the Parties hereto, and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

contained in this Agreement shall be severable. Should any provision, in whole
or in part, be held invalid as a matter of law, such holding shall not affect
the other provisions of this Agreement, and such provisions that are not
invalid shall be given effect without the invalid provision.

  

10.16 _Disclosure Generally_. If and to the extent any information required to
be furnished in any Disclosure Schedule is contained in any other Disclosure
Schedule, such information shall be deemed to be included in such other
Disclosure Schedules in which the information would otherwise be required to
be included and shall constitute a disclosure with respect to such other
Disclosure Schedule, solely to the extent to which the relevance of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. By listing matters on the
Disclosure Schedules, Seller or any of its Affiliates shall not be deemed to
