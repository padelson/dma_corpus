substantially in the form attached as Annex A to the New CVR Agreement (each,
a " _New CVR  Certificate_ ").

 


 

 

Section 2.03 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or  the holders of the Company Common Stock:

 


 

 

(a) other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to
_Section 2.03(b)_ and (ii) Dissenting Shares (such shares together with the
shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.03(b)_
,  collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), each share of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately  prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be

of Parent Common Stock (the " _Share Consideration_ "), subject to _Section
2.08_   with respect to fractional shares, (B) $50.00 in cash without
interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ ")  and (C) one contingent value right
(a " _New CVR_ ") issued by Parent subject to and in accordance with  the New

together, the " _Merger Consideration_ ");

 


 

 

(b) (i) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury
stock or owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time (other than any such shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub in a
fiduciary,  representative or other capacity on behalf of other Persons,
whether or not held in a separate account) shall be cancelled, and no
consideration shall be paid with respect thereto and (ii) each share of
Company Common Stock held by any wholly  owned Subsidiary of either the
Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time (other than shares held in a fiduciary, representative or other
capacity on behalf of other Persons, whether or not held in a  separate
account) shall be converted into such number of fully paid and non-assessable
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership
percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately 
following the Merger Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of
such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time;

 


 

 

 

20  

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the  Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute (together with any
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation described in Section
2.03(b) _(ii)_ ) the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation; and

 


 

 

(d) all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and (i) each share of Company Common Stock that was, immediately
prior to the Merger  Effective Time, represented by a certificate (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and (ii) each uncertificated  share of Company Common Stock
which, immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, was registered to a
holder on the stock transfer books of the Company (an "
_Uncertificated        Share_ ") shall (in each case, other than with
respect to Excluded Shares) thereafter represent only the right to receive (A)
the Merger Consideration and (B) with respect  to the Share Consideration,
the right to receive (1) any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section 2.04(f)_ and (2) any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent

in accordance with _Section 2.04_ , without interest.

 


 

 

Section 2.04 _Surrender and Payment_.

 


 

 

(a) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_
") and enter into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange        Agent
Agreement_ ") for the purpose of exchanging (i) Certificates or (ii)
Uncertificated Shares for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company  Common Stock. As of the Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Section
2.04_ through the Exchange Agent,  (x) certificates (or evidence of shares in
book-entry form) representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, (y) cash sufficient to pay the  aggregate Cash Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ and (z) New CVR Certificates
representing the New CVRs issuable pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ and the New
CVR Agreement. Parent agrees to make available, directly or indirectly, to the
Exchange Agent from time to time as needed additional cash sufficient to pay
any dividends or  other distributions to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.04(f)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.08_. Promptly after the  Merger Effective Time (and in no event more than
two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date), Parent shall send, or shall
cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock at the Merger Effective Time a  letter of transmittal and instructions
(which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and
substantially finalized prior to the Merger Effective Time and which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and  title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. All
certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) representing shares of
Parent  Common Stock and New CVR Certificates and cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.04_ shall be referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Exchange       Fund_ ". Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued
or paid pursuant to this Article II out of the Exchange Fund.   The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that
such cash shall only be invested in the manner provided in the Exchange Agent
Agreement; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company
Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of 
fractional interests; _provided_ , _further_ , that to the extent necessary to
pay the Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly cause to be provided
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the  benefit of holders of Company
Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such
losses. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
the property of, and paid to, Parent upon termination of  the Exchange Fund.

 


 

 

 

21  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly  completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, or (ii)
receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case
of a book-entry transfer of  Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration
in respect of each share of the Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share (including cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends  and distributions with
respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.08_ and
_Section 2.04(f)_ ). The shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Share
Consideration, at Parent's option, shall be in  uncertificated book-entry
form, unless a physical certificate is requested by a holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or is otherwise required under Applicable Law.

 


 

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration (or cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends and distributions
with respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.08_ or
_Section  2.04(f)_ ) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such
Certificate shall be  properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and
(ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or similar Taxes required as a  result of such payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such transfer or
similar Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

 


 

 

 

22  

(d) Upon the Merger Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. If, after the Merger Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares  are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock and any dividends and  distributions with respect to the Share
Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.08_ and _Section 2.04(f)_ ) with
respect thereto in accordance with the procedures set forth in, or as
otherwise contemplated by, this _Article II_   (including this _Section 2.04_
).

 


 

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months following the Closing Date
shall be delivered to Parent or as otherwise instructed by Parent, and any
such holder  who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.04_ prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration
(and cash in lieu of  any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any
dividends and distributions with respect to the Share Consideration as
contemplated by _Section 2.08_ and _Section 2.04(f)_ ), without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall not be liable
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts properly paid
to a public official in compliance with applicable  abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority  shall
become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 


 

 

(f) Following the surrender of any Certificates, along with the delivery of a
properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, or the transfer of
any Uncertificated Shares, in each case as provided in this _Section 2.04_ , 
Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, without interest, to the Person in
whose name the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Share
Consideration have been registered, (i) in connection with the payment of the
Share Consideration, (x)  the amount of any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.08_
, and (y) the aggregate amount of all dividends or other distributions payable
with respect to such shares of Parent  Common Stock with a record date on or
after the Merger Effective Time that were paid prior to the time of such
surrender or transfer, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date after the
payment of the Merger Consideration, the amount of all  dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to whole shares of Parent Common Stock
constituting the Share Consideration with a record date on or after the Merger
Effective Time and prior to the time of such surrender or transfer and  with
a payment date subsequent to the time of such surrender or transfer. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
constituting the Share Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares  pursuant to _Section 2.08_ , shall be paid to the holder
of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not
transferred until such Certificates are surrendered and the holder thereof
delivers a properly completed and  duly executed letter of transmittal or
such Uncertificated Shares are transferred, as the case may be, as provided in
this _Section 2.04_.

 


 

 

 

23  

(g) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
value added and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred by a holder of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger,
and the  filing of any related Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the responsibility solely of such
holder.

 


 

 

Section 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and that are held
by a stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions
of Section 262 of the  DGCL (such stockholders, the " _Dissenting
Stockholders_ " and, such shares of Company Common Stock,  the " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive  the Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled
to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and, at the Merger Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares  shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance  with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL.
If any Dissenting Stockholders shall have failed  to perfect or shall have
effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such rights, the Dissenting Shares held
by such Dissenting Stockholder shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted, as of the Merger Effective Time, into the right to receive the 
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.03(a)_ (and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends and distributions
with respect thereto as contemplated by _Section 2.04(f)_ and _Section 2.08_
),       without interest. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by  the Company relating to stockholders'
rights of appraisal in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to all such demands.   The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to, settle or offer or agree to settle any such demands. Any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant  to
_Section 2.04_ to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal
rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

 


 

 

Section 2.06 _Company Equity Awards._

 


 

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. At the Merger Effective Time, each compensatory
option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under any Company Stock Plan
that is  outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether or not vested
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the
holder thereof be:

 


 

 

 

24  

 

(i) if such  Company Stock Option is an In-the-Money Option, assumed by
Parent and converted into (A) an option (an " _Assumed In-the-Money Option_ ")
to purchase, on the same  terms and conditions (including applicable vesting,
exercise and expiration provisions and any terms and conditions relating to
accelerated vesting upon a termination of the holder's employment in
connection with or following the Merger) as  applied to each such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, shares of Parent
Common Stock, except that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares, subject to such  Assumed In-the-
Money Option shall equal the product of (1) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Merger Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (2) the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio, and the per-share exercise price, rounded up to the nearest whole cent,
shall equal the quotient of (x) the exercise price per share of Company 
Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time, _divided by_ (y) the Equity Award
Exchange  Ratio, and (B) the right to receive (1) if such In-the-Money Option
was vested prior to the Merger Effective Time, one New CVR for each share of
Company Common Stock underlying such In-the-Money Option immediately prior to
the Merger Effective  Time to be delivered within five (5) Business Days
following the Merger Effective Time or (2) if such In-the-Money Option was not
vested immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, immediately upon, and
subject to, the vesting of the Assumed  In-the-Money Option, the Unvested
Equity Award CVR Consideration (as defined in _Section 2.06(e)_ below); or

 


 

(ii) if such  Company Stock Option is an Out-of-the-Money Option, assumed by
Parent and converted into an option (an " _Assumed Out-of-the-Money Stock
Option_ ") to purchase,  on the same terms and conditions (including
applicable vesting, exercise and expiration provisions and any terms and
conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of the holder's
employment in connection with or following the  Merger) as applied to each
such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time,
shares of Parent Common Stock, except that the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares,  subject to
such Assumed Out-of-the-Money Stock Option shall equal the product of (1) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, _multiplied by_
(2) the Out-of-the-Money Option Exchange Ratio, and the per-share exercise
price, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, shall equal the quotient of  (x)
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company
Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time,
_divided by_   (y) the Out-of-the-Money Option Exchange Ratio;

 


 

 

 

 

_provided_ that each Company Stock Option that is an "incentive stock option"
(as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with
the requirements of Section 424 of the Code, and each Company  Stock Option
shall be adjusted in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code.

 


 

 

 

25  

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Merger Effective Time, each
restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding under  any Company Stock Plan that vests solely based on the
passage of time (each, a " _Company RSU Award_ ")  shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be
assumed by Parent and shall be converted into (i) a restricted unit award
(each, an " _Assumed Restricted Unit Award_ ") that settles in a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying the  Company RSU Award _multiplied by_ the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole  number of shares, and (ii)
the right to receive, immediately upon, and subject to, the vesting of the
Assumed Restricted Unit Award, the Unvested Equity Award CVR Consideration.
Each Assumed Restricted Unit Award shall continue to have, and  shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding
Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (including
any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of
the  holder's employment in connection with or following the Merger).

 


 

 

(c) _Company Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units_. At the Merger
Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock  outstanding under any Company Stock Plan that vests
based on the achievement of performance goals (each, a " _Company PSU Award_
") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of
the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into (i) a
restricted stock unit award (each, an " _Assumed Performance Unit Award_ ")
that settles in a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product  of the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the
Company PSU Award (with such number of shares determined __ by deeming the
applicable performance goals to be achieved at the greater of (A) the target
level and (B) the actual level of achievement through the end of the calendar
quarter immediately _preceding_ the quarter in which the Merger Effective Time
occurs as determined by the Management Compensation and Development 
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the Merger
Effective Time) _multiplied by_ the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole number of shares, and (ii) the right to receive, immediately
upon, and subject to, the vesting of the Assumed Performance Unit Award, the
Unvested Equity Award CVR  Consideration. Each Assumed Performance Unit Award
shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions
as applied to the corresponding Company PSU Award (other than performance-
based vesting conditions) immediately  prior to the Merger Effective Time
(including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a
termination of the holder's employment in connection with or following the
Merger).

 


 

 

(d) _Company Restricted Stock Awards_. At the Merger Effective Time, each
restricted stock award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding under any  Company Stock Plan that vests based on the passage of
time and/or the achievement of performance goals (each, a " _Company RSA_ ")
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the
holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into (i) a
restricted stock award (each, an " _Assumed Restricted Stock Award_ ") that
settles in a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number  of
shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Company RSA _multiplied by_ the
Equity Award  Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole number of
shares, and (ii) the right to receive, immediately upon, and subject to, the
vesting of the Assumed Restricted Stock Award, the Unvested Equity Award CVR

corresponding Company RSA immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time
(including any terms and conditions relating to  accelerated vesting upon a
termination of the holder's employment in connection with or following the
Merger).

 


 

 

 

26  

(e) _Unvested Equity Award CVR Consideration_. With respect to each In-the-
Money Option that is unvested as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time, each  Company RSU Award, each Company PSU Award, and each Company RSA,
the " _Unvested Equity Award CVR Consideration_ " means either (i) if the
Vesting Date (as defined below) occurs prior to the Milestone Payment Record
Date (as defined in the New CVR Agreement) and prior to the Termination Date
(as defined in the New CVR Agreement), one New CVR in  respect of each share
of Company Common Stock underlying such In-the-Money Option, Company RSU
Award, Company PSU Award, or Company RSA, as applicable, immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time, (ii) if the Vesting Date occurs on or after  the
Milestone Payment Record Date, a cash payment equal to the Milestone Payment
(as defined in the New CVR Agreement) in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock underlying such In-the-Money Option, Company RSU Award, Company
PSU Award, or  Company RSA, as applicable, immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time, or (iii) if the Vesting Date occurs on or after the
Termination Date and the Milestone (as defined in the New CVR Agreement) was
not achieved prior to the Termination  Date, no additional consideration. As
used in this _Section 2.06(e)_ , " _Vesting Date_ " means  the date on which
the Assumed In-the-Money Option, Assumed Restricted Unit Award, Assumed
Performance Unit Award, or Assumed Restricted Stock Award that was issued in
exchange for the applicable In-the-Money Option, Company RSU Award, Company
PSU  Award, or Company RSA, as applicable, becomes vested. For purposes of
this _Section 2.06(e)_ , the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying each Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time will be determined  in accordance with _Section 2.06(c)(i)_.

 


 

 

(f) _Reservation of Shares_. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date
(but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date),
Parent  shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor
form) or, if required, Form S-3 (or any successor form), with respect to the
issuance of (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed In-
the-Money Options, the  Assumed Out-of-the-Money Options, the Assumed
Restricted Unit Awards, the Assumed Performance Unit Awards, and the Assumed
Restricted Stock Awards, and (ii) the New CVRs to holders of Assumed In-the-
Money Options that are unvested as of  immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time, Assumed Restricted Unit Awards, Assumed Performance Unit
Awards, and Assumed Restricted Stock Awards, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration  statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Assumed In-the-Money

Awards,  the Assumed Performance Unit Awards, and the Assumed Restricted
Stock Awards remain outstanding.

 


 

 

(g) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (and/or the Management Compensation and Development
Committee of the  Board of Directors of the Company) and the Board of
Directors of Parent (and/or the Compensation and Management Development
Committee of the Board of Directors of Parent) shall adopt such resolutions as
are necessary to give effect to the  transactions contemplated by this
_Section 2.06_.

 


 

 

Section 2.07 _Adjustments_. Without limiting or affecting any of the
provisions of _Section 6.01_ or _Section 7.01_ , if, during the period between
the  date of this Agreement and the Merger Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur as a
result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including
reverse stock split),  merger, combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and
any other amounts payable pursuant to this  Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event on the Merger Consideration or
any such other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

27  

 

 

Section 2.08 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or fractional New
CVRs shall be  issued in the Merger. Each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive as a result of the
Merger a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock or a fractional New CVR
(after aggregating all shares  represented by the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares delivered by such holder), as the case may be, shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount (rounded down
to the nearest cent) representing such holder's  proportionate interest in
the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of all such
holders of shares of Parent Common Stock or New CVRs, respectively, that would
otherwise be issued.

 

 


 

 

 

 

Section 2.09 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to  this Agreement such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of any Applicable Law, including federal, state,
local or non-U.S. Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Parent or  the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds and pays over all amounts so
withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in 
respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 


 

 

Section 2.10 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a customary bond issued for lost, stolen or
destroyed stock certificates, in such reasonable amount as the  Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will, if such holder has 
otherwise delivered a properly completed and duly executed letter of
transmittal, issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock  represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by
this _Article II_ (including _Section 2.04_ ).

 


 

 

Section 2.11 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Merger Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on  behalf of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub, any other actions and  things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving 
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Section 3.01 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving

and the Financing Sources party thereto  (including all exhibits, schedules,
and annexes to such letters in effect as of the date hereof), pursuant to
which the Financing Sources have committed, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, to provide the  debt financing described
therein in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) a
true and complete copy of the fully executed fee letter referenced therein
(together, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") relating to fees with respect to
the Debt Financing (redacted to remove only fee  amounts, the rates and
amounts included in the "market flex" provisions and certain other economic
terms (none of which could adversely affect the amounts, availability, timing
or conditionality of the Debt Financing)). The Debt  Commitment Letter and
any other debt commitment letter (including any replacement of the Debt
Commitment Letter and related fee letter in connection with any Alternative
Financing) executed in accordance with _Section 7.06_ , as  replaced,
amended, supplemented, modified or waived in accordance with _Section 7.06_ ,
including all exhibits, schedules, and annexes to such letters, are
hereinafter referred to together as the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ ". The
financing contemplated pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters is 
hereinafter referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ ".

 


 

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, and
to the knowledge of Parent, the other  parties thereto, and enforceable in
accordance with its terms against Parent, and to the knowledge of Parent, each
of the other parties thereto, in each case, subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exceptions. All commitment fees  required to be paid under the Debt
Commitment Letters have been paid in full by Parent or will be duly paid in
full by Parent as and when due, and Parent has otherwise satisfied all of the
other items and conditions required to be  satisfied by Parent, and within
its control, pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter on or prior
to the date of this Agreement. The Debt Commitment Letter has not been
amended, restated, modified or terminated, nor has  compliance with any term
thereof been waived, on or prior to the date of this Agreement and the
respective commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been
withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in any respect on or  prior to the
date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default, in each case, on
the  part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party, under
the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) assuming the accuracy of the Company's
representations and warranties contained in Article IV and compliance by the
Company with  its covenants contained in _Article VI_ and _Article VIII_ , in
each case, in all material respects, Parent has no knowledge that any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied on the Closing Date or
that  the Debt Financing or any other funds necessary for the satisfaction of
all of Parent's and its Subsidiaries' obligations under this Agreement will
not be available to Parent on the Closing Date. The consummation of the Debt
Financing  is subject to no conditions precedent other than those expressly
set forth in the copy of the Debt Commitment Letter delivered to the Company,
and there are no contingencies that would permit the Financing Sources to
reduce the total  amount of the Debt Financing other than those expressly set
forth in the copy of the Debt Commitment Letter delivered to the Company on or
prior to the date hereof. Except for any engagement letters or related fee
letters related to  the permanent financing referred to in the Debt
Commitment Letters, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no side
letters or other agreements, Contracts or arrangements to which Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective  Affiliates are a party related to the
funding of the Debt Financing. Assuming (A) the funding of the full amount of
the Debt Financing in accordance with and subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter  and (B) the accuracy in all
material respects of the Company's representations and warranties set forth in
_Article IV_ of this Agreement and compliance in all material respects by the
Company with its covenants, agreements and  obligations under _Article VI_
and _Article VIII_ of this Agreement, the aggregate proceeds of the Debt
Financing, together with cash or cash equivalents held by Parent and the other
sources of funds referenced in the Debt  Commitment Letters, as of the Merger
Effective Time, will be sufficient to enable Parent to pay in cash all amounts
required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in cash on the Closing Date,
including the Cash Consideration, and all  payments, fees and expenses
payable by them related to or arising out of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are required to be paid as of
such date. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub  hereunder are not
conditioned in any manner upon Parent or Merger Sub obtaining any financing.

operations, assets,  liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
future operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts,
plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates,  projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries
or any other matter furnished or provided to Parent or made available to
Parent in any "data  rooms," "virtual data rooms," management presentations
or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with, this Agreement,
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub specifically  disclaims that it is relying upon or has relied upon any
such other representations or warranties that may have been made by any
Person, and acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its Affiliates have
specifically disclaimed and do  hereby specifically disclaim any such other

after the date of this Agreement a Company Superior Proposal or an unsolicited
bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, is or could  reasonably be expected to
lead to a Company Superior Proposal, (ii) furnish to such Third Party and its
Representatives and financing sources nonpublic information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a  confidentiality agreement
with confidentiality and use provisions no less favorable and other provisions
no less favorable in the aggregate, in each case, to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of  which shall be
provided, promptly after its execution, to Parent for informational purposes;
_provided_ that all such non-public information (to the extent that such
information has not been  previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third
Party, and (iii) following receipt of  a Company Superior Proposal after the
date of this Agreement, (A) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or (B) terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.01(d)(iii)_

outside legal counsel and financial  advisor, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of
Directors of the Company from (x) complying  with Rule 14e-2(a) under the
1934 Act with regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal, so long as any action

consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable Law;

relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal may only be made in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section 6.02(b)_ , _Section 6.02(c)_ and
_Section      6.02(e)_. A "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act
shall not be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 


 

 

(c) In addition to the requirements set forth in _Section 6.02(b)_ , the Board
of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (i) through (iii) of _Section         6.02(b)_ unless the
Company shall have first delivered to Parent written notice advising Parent
that the Company intends to take such action. The Company shall notify Parent
as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than  forty eight (48)
hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any
Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, 
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
by any Third Party that, to the knowledge of the Company, is reasonably likely
to make or has made any Company Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be 
provided in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the
material terms and conditions of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal or
request. The Company shall thereafter (x) keep Parent reasonably informed, on
a  reasonably current basis, of any material changes in the status and
details of any such Company Acquisition Proposal or request and (y) as
promptly as practicable (but in no event later than twenty four (24) hours
after receipt) provide  to Parent copies of all material correspondence and
written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that describes any terms or conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal (as
well as written summaries of  any material oral communications relating to
the terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Company Approval Time (and in no event after the Company Approval
Time), the Board of Directors of the  Company may effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company Intervening Event if
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that  the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law; _provided_ that (i) the Company shall first notify
Parent in writing of its  intention to take such action, which notice shall
include a reasonably detailed description of such Company Intervening Event,
(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall discuss
and negotiate in good faith  with Parent and its Representatives (to the
extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) during the four (4) Business Day
period following such notice regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement in response to  such Company Intervening Event, and
(iii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall not effect any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company Intervening
Event unless, after the four (4) Business Day  period described in the
foregoing clause (ii), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into
account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this  Agreement during
such four (4) Business Day period, that the failure to take such action would
continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law.

 


 

 

(e) Without limiting or affecting _Section 6.02(a)_ , _Section 6.02(b)_ or
_Section 6.02(c)_ , the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make a
Company Adverse  Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company
Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company
first notifies Parent, in  writing at least four (4) Business Days before

providing for such Company  Superior Proposal and the identity of the Third
Party(ies) making the Company Superior Proposal, (ii) if requested by Parent,
during such four (4) Business Day period, the Company and its Representatives
have discussed and negotiated in  good faith with Parent (to the extent that
Parent desires to so negotiate) regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement in response to such Company Superior Proposal and
(iii) after such four (4) Business Day  period, the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account any proposal by
Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement, that  such Company Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal and that the
failure to take such action would continue to be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law (it  being
understood and agreed that in the event of any amendment to the financial
terms or other material terms of any such Company Superior Proposal, a new
written notification from the Company consistent with that described in
clause  (i) of this _Section 6.02(e)_ shall be required, and a new notice
period under clause (i) of this _Section 6.02(e)_ shall commence, during which
notice period the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements
of  this _Section 6.02(e)_ anew, except that such new notice period shall be
for two (2) Business Days (as opposed to four (4) Business Days)). After
delivery of such written notice pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, the  Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis of all material developments affecting the material terms of any
such Company Superior Proposal (and the Company shall provide Parent with
copies of any  additional written materials received that provide for or that
are material to such Company Superior Proposal).

nature, terms and conditionality of any committed financing), would result in
a transaction (i) that, if  consummated, is more favorable to the Company's
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger (taking into
account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement), and (ii)
that is reasonably capable of being  completed on the terms proposed, taking

reasonable best efforts to cause any such party (and any of its 
Representatives) in possession of confidential information about the Company

or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, discovers any information that should be set
forth  in an amendment or supplement to the Debt Offer Documents, so that the
Debt Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order  to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Merger Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise set forth in
this _Section 7.02_ , Parent  shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and its Subsidiaries' directors and officers to not, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' other
Representatives to not, directly or indirectly,  (i) solicit, initiate or
take any action to knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by
way of furnishing information) the submission of any Parent Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or  negotiations
with, furnish any information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or

Statement/Prospectus or (C) recommend, adopt or approve or publicly propose
to  recommend, adopt or approve any Parent Acquisition Proposal (any of the
foregoing in this clause (iii), a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ "),
or (iv) take any action to make any "moratorium", "control share acquisition",
"fair price", "supermajority", "affiliate transactions" or "business
combination  statute or regulation" or other similar anti-takeover laws and
regulations of the State of Delaware, including Section 203 of the DGCL,
inapplicable to any Third Party or any Parent Acquisition Proposal.

 


 

 

 

83  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to the receipt of the
Parent Stockholder Approval (the " _Parent         Approval Time_ ")
(and in no event after the Parent Approval Time), the Board of Directors of
Parent receives a bona fide written Parent Acquisition Proposal made after the
date hereof which has not  resulted from a violation of this _Section 7.02_ ,
the Board of Directors of Parent, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, may (x) contact the Third Party that has made such Parent
Acquisition Proposal in order to  ascertain facts or clarify terms for the
sole purpose of the Board of Directors of Parent informing itself about such
Parent Acquisition Proposal and such Third Party and (y) subject to compliance
with this _Section 7.02(b)_ , _Section     7.02(c)_ and _Section 7.02(e)_
, (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that, subject
to Parent's compliance with _Section 7.02(a)_ , has made after the date of
this Agreement a Parent Superior  Proposal or an unsolicited bona fide
written Parent  Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Superior Proposal,  (ii) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives
and financing sources nonpublic information relating to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with confidentiality and
use provisions no less  favorable and other provisions no less favorable in
the aggregate, in each case, to Parent than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which shall be provided, promptly after
its execution, to the Company for  informational purposes; _provided_ that
all such non-public information (to the extent that such information has not
been previously provided or made available to the Company) is provided or
made  available to the Company, as the case may be, substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third
Party and (iii) following receipt of a Parent Superior Proposal after the date
of this Agreement,  (A) make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change and/or
(B) terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.01(c)(iii)_ to
enter into a definitive agreement providing for such Parent Superior Proposal,
but in the case of  this clause (iii) only if the Board of Directors of
Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with Parent's outside
legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be  inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of
Directors of Parent from (x) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act
with regard to a Parent Acquisition Proposal,  so long as any action taken or
statement made to so comply is consistent with this _Section 7.02_ , or (y)
making any required disclosure to the stockholders of Parent if the Board of
Directors of Parent determines in good faith,  after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable Law; _provided_ that any
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating  to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal may only be made in accordance with the provisions of
this _Section 7.02(b)_ , _Section 7.02(c)_ and _Section 7.02(e)_. A "stop,
look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of  the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act shall not be a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 


 

 

 

84  

(c) In addition to the requirements set forth in _Section 7.02(b)_ , the Board
of Directors of Parent shall not take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (i) through (iii) of _Section         7.02(b)_ unless Parent
shall have first delivered to the Company written notice advising the Company
that Parent intends to take such action. Parent shall notify the Company as
promptly as practicable (but in no event later than  forty eight (48) hours)
after receipt by Parent (or any of its Representatives) of any Parent
Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties,  assets, books
or records of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that, to
the knowledge of Parent, is reasonably likely to make or has made any Parent
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided in writing and  shall
identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any
such Parent Acquisition Proposal or request. Parent shall thereafter (x) keep
the Company reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any 
material changes in the status and details of any such Parent Acquisition
Proposal or request and (y) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later
than twenty four (24) hours after receipt) provide to the Company copies of
all  material correspondence and written materials sent or provided to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions of any
Parent Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any material
oral  communications relating to the terms and conditions of any Parent
Acquisition Proposal).

 


 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Parent Approval Time (and in no event after the Parent Approval
Time), the Board of Directors of  Parent may effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Parent Intervening Event if
the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the  failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; _provided_ that (i) Parent shall first notify the Company in
writing of its  intention to take such action, which notice shall include a
reasonably detailed description of such Company Intervening Event, (ii) if
requested by the Company, Parent and its Representatives shall discuss and
negotiate in good faith  with the Company and its Representatives (to the
extent that the Company desires to so negotiate) during the four (4) Business
Day period following such notice regarding any proposal by the Company to
amend the terms of this Agreement  in response to such Parent Intervening
Event, and (iii) the Board of Directors of Parent shall not effect any Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Parent Intervening
Event unless, after the four (4) Business  Day period described in the
foregoing clause (ii), the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into
account any proposal by the Company to amend the terms of  this Agreement
during such four (4) Business Day period, that the failure to take such action
would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law.

 


 

 

(e) Without limiting or affecting Section 7.02(a), Section 7.02(b) or Section
7.02(c), the Board of Directors of Parent shall not make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change involving or  relating to a Parent Superior Proposal or
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
a Parent Superior Proposal unless (i) Parent first notifies the Company, in
writing at least four (4) Business Days  before taking such action, that
Parent intends to take such action, which notice attaches the most current
version of each proposed Contract or other agreement providing for such Parent
Superior Proposal and the identity of the Third  Party(ies) making the Parent
Superior Proposal, (ii) if requested by the Company, during such four (4)
Business Day period, Parent and its Representatives have discussed and
negotiated in good faith with the Company (to the extent that  the Company
desires to so negotiate) regarding any proposal by the Company to amend the
terms of this Agreement in response to such Parent Superior Proposal and (iii)
after such four (4) Business Day period, the Board of Directors of  Parent
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel and taking into account any proposal by the Company to
amend the terms of this Agreement, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal 
continues to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal and that the failure to
take such action would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law (it being understood and agreed
that in  the event of any amendment to the financial terms or other material
terms of any such Parent Superior Proposal, a new written notification from
Parent consistent with that described in clause (i) of this Section 7.02(e)
shall be  required, and a new notice period under clause (i) of this Section
7.02(e) shall commence, during which notice period Parent shall be required to
comply with the requirements of this Section 7.02(e) anew, except that such
new notice  period shall be for two (2) Business Days (as opposed to four (4)
Business Days)). After delivery of such written notice pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a reasonably  current basis of all material developments
affecting the material terms of any such Parent Superior Proposal (and Parent
shall provide the Company with copies of any additional written materials
received that provide for or that are  material to such Parent Superior
Proposal).

 


 

 

 

85  

(f) " _Parent Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide, written Parent 
Acquisition Proposal (other than a Parent Acquisition Proposal which has
resulted from a violation of this _Section 7.02_ ) (with all references to
"twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Parent Acquisition Proposal
being  deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)") on terms that the
Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all
the terms  and conditions of the Parent Acquisition Proposal that the Board
of Directors of Parent considers to be appropriate (including the identity of
the Person making the Parent Acquisition Proposal and the expected timing and
likelihood of  consummation, any governmental or other approval requirements
(including divestitures and entry into other commitments and limitations),
break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation
and the availability of  necessary financing (including, if a cash
transaction (in whole or in part), the availability of such funds and the
nature, terms and conditionality of any committed financing), would result in
a transaction (i) that, if consummated, is  more favorable to Parent's
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger (taking into
account any proposal by the Company to amend the terms of this Agreement), and
(ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed on the  terms proposed,
taking into account the identity of the Person making the Parent Acquisition
Proposal, any approval requirements and all other financial, regulatory, legal
and other aspects of such Parent Acquisition Proposal.

 


 

 

(g) " _Parent Intervening Event_ " means any material event, fact, change,
effect, development or occurrence that (i) was not known, or the material
consequences of which were not known, in each case to the Board of Directors
of Parent as of or prior to  the date of this Agreement and (ii) does not
relate to or involve any Parent Acquisition Proposal.

 


 

 

 

86  

(h) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to and its and its
Subsidiaries' directors and officers to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries'  other Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to
the date of this Agreement with respect to any Parent  Acquisition Proposal
or with respect to any indication, proposal or inquiry that could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any such party (and any of its 
Representatives) in possession of confidential information about Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of Parent to return or
destroy all such information.

 


 

 

Section 7.03 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Until the Merger Effective Time,
Parent shall at all  times be the direct or indirect owner of all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause each of Merger Sub to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate  the Merger on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Promptly following the execution of
this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub,
shall execute and deliver a written  consent of Merger Sub adopting this
Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

 


 

 

Section 7.04 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 


 

 

(a) For a period of not less than six years from the Merger Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any applicable Subsidiary
thereof (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnifying Parties_"), to the fullest
extent each such DandO  Indemnifying Party is so authorized or permitted by
Applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, to: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is at the date hereof, was previously, or during the
period from the date hereof  through the date of the Merger Effective Time
will be, serving as a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or, at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, as a director, trustee or  officer of any other entity or
any benefit plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_"), as now or hereafter in
effect, in connection with any DandO Claim and any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, Claim Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and  amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) relating to or
resulting from such DandO Claim; and (ii) promptly advance to such  DandO
Indemnified Party any Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a
witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any DandO
Claim in advance of the final disposition of such DandO Claim, including 
payment on behalf of or advancement to the DandO Indemnified Party of any Claim
Expenses incurred by such DandO Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing
any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in  each
case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to the
DandO Indemnifying Party's receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of
such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is  ultimately
determined under Applicable Law that such DandO Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified. All rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to be a 
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date
hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such Person's heirs, successors,
executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in this _Section
7.04_ :  (x) the term " _D andO Claim_" means any threatened, asserted,
pending  or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or
investigation, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental
Authority or any other Person, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including  any arbitration or other alternative
dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that
relate to such DandO Indemnified Party's duties or service (A) as a director or
officer of the Company or the applicable  Subsidiary thereof at or prior to
the Merger Effective Time (including with respect to any acts, facts, events
or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the
Merger or the consummation of the other  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process
undertaken in connection therewith and any DandO Claim relating thereto) or (B)
as a director, trustee or officer of any  other entity or any benefit plan
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (for which such DandO
Indemnified Party is or was serving at the request or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) at or prior  to the Merger Effective
Time; and (y) the term " _Claim Expenses_ " means  reasonable out-of-pocket
attorneys' fees and all other reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and
obligations (including experts' fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers,
transcript fees, legal research, duplicating, printing  and binding costs, as
well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate,  defend, be a witness
in or participate in (including on appeal) any DandO Claim for which
indemnification is authorized pursuant to this _Section 7.04(a)_ , including
any action relating to a claim for indemnification or  advancement brought by
a DandO Indemnified Party.

 


 

 

 

87  

(b) For a period of not less than six (6) years from the Merger Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less  favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitations on liability of
directors and officers than are set forth in the Company Organizational
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or  otherwise
modified for a period of at least six (6) years from the Merger Effective Time
in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of any DandO
Indemnified Party, unless any modification or amendment is required  by
Applicable Law (but then only to the minimum extent required by Applicable
Law). At the Company's option and expense, prior to the Merger Effective Time,
the Company may purchase (and pay in full the aggregate premium for) a six 
(6)-year prepaid "tail" insurance policy (which policy by its express terms
shall survive the Merger) of at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered
individuals as  the Company's and its Subsidiaries' existing directors' and
officers' insurance policy or policies with a claims period of six (6) years
from the Merger Effective Time for DandO Claims arising from facts, acts, events
or omissions  that occurred on or prior to the Merger Effective Time;
_provided_ that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed three
hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by  the
Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance (such amount being the "
_Maximum Premium_ "). If the Company fails to obtain such tail policy prior to
the Merger Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
such a tail policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that the premium for such tail
policy shall not exceed the Maximum Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , that if
such tail policy  cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying
aggregate annual premiums in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to obtain as much
coverage as can be obtained by  paying an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Premium. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause any such policy
(whether obtained by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation) to be
maintained in full force and effect,  for its full term, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all its obligations thereunder.

 


 

 

 

88  

 

 

   

 

(c) If any of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company, partnership or 
other Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or
winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be  made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
7.04_.

 

 


 

 

Section 7.05 _Employee Matters_.

 


 

 

(a) From the Closing Date through the one (1) year anniversary thereof (the "
_Compensation Continuation Period_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall
provide, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each
individual who is employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the  Merger Effective Time, while such individual continues to be
employed by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries
(including Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation) during the Compensation
Continuation Period  (collectively, the " _Affected Employees_ ") (i) a base
salary or wage rate that is not less  than the base salary or wage rate
provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time, (ii) cash incentive compensation (including bonus opportunity and other
cash incentive compensation opportunities) and  equity incentive compensation
no less favorable in the aggregate than the cash incentive compensation
(including bonus opportunity and other cash incentive compensation
opportunities) and equity incentive compensation provided to such  Affected
Employee immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, and (iii) severance
benefits in amounts and on terms and conditions that are no less favorable
than those provided to the Affected Employees immediately prior to the
Merger  Effective Time, as set forth in the Company's Severance Pay Plans
disclosed to Parent before the date hereof. From the Closing Date through
December 31, 2019, Affected Employees shall be provided with employee benefits
substantially  similar in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided
to such Affected Employee under the Company Employee Plans immediately prior
to the Merger Effective Time; _provided_ that, for purposes of determining
that such employee benefits are no less favorable in the  aggregate, defined
benefit pension plan benefits, retention or change in control payments or
awards provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Merger
Effective Time shall not be taken into account.

  
   

(b) With respect to any employee  benefit plan in which any Affected Employee
first becomes eligible to participate on or after the Merger Effective Time
(the " _New Company Plans_ "), Parent  shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
such Affected Employee under any New Company Plan that  is a health plan in
which such Affected Employee may be eligible to participate after the Merger
Effective Time, and (ii) if applicable, cause to be credited, in any New
Company Plan that is a health plan in which Affected Employees  participate,
any deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Affected Employee
and such Affected Employee's eligible beneficiaries and dependents during the
portion of the calendar year in which the Merger Effective Time occurs  prior
to such Affected Employee's commencement of participation in such New Company
Plan providing health benefits with the objective that there be no double
counting during the year in which the Merger Effective Time occurs of such 
deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses. Parent shall recognize service of
Affected Employees (to the extent credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries)
accrued prior to the Merger Effective Time for all purposes under (but not for
the  purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) any
New Company Plan in which such Affected Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Merger Effective Time, _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall any credit be given to the extent it would result in the
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 


 

 

 

89    

(c) Parent agrees that, with respect to the annual cash incentive plans set
forth on _Section 7.05(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Annual     Incentive Plans_ "), it shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, to provide each participant in an Annual Incentive Plan (each an
" _Incentive Plan Participant_ ") who remains employed with the Surviving
Corporation through the end of the  year during which the Closing occurs,
with an annual cash incentive award for the year during which the Closing
occurs, the amount of which shall be determined as the product of (i) the sum
of the following: (a) a pro-rated portion of the  bonus with respect to the
portion of the year of the Closing that occurs prior to the Closing, which
bonus shall be determined based upon actual corporate performance through the
Closing Date, as determined by the Company prior to the  Merger Effective
Time _plus_ (b) a pro-rated portion of the bonus with respect to the portion
of the year of the Closing that occurs after the Closing, which bonus shall be
no less than the bonus payable at the applicable Incentive  Plan
Participant's target incentive level under such Annual incentive Plan,
multiplied by (ii) the Incentive Plan Participant's individual performance
multiplier determined in accordance with the terms of the Annual Incentive
Plan; _provided_ that,  contingent upon the execution and non-revocation of a
customary release of claims in a form that is reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and does not contain any restrictive covenants, each Incentive Plan
Participant who experiences a  termination of employment on or after the
Closing due to death or disability (as defined in the Company's long-term
disability plan), or with respect to which such Incentive Plan Participant is
eligible to receive severance benefits under  any Company Employee Plan or
applicable Law, shall be entitled to the prorated payment of the amount that
would otherwise have been payable under this _Section 7.05(c)_ _(i)_ (i.e.,
without applying the individual performance multiplier referred to in clause
(ii)); and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall payment of any
amounts under the Annual Incentive Plans (or any  pro-rated portion thereof)
pursuant to this _Section 7.05(c)_ result in the duplication of payments to
any Incentive Plan Participant under any other incentive, severance or other
similar arrangement.

 


 

 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.05_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
express or implied (i) shall cause either Parent or any of its Affiliates to
be obligated to continue to employ any Person, including any  Affected
Employees, for any period of time following the Merger Effective Time, (ii)
shall prevent Parent or its Affiliates from revising, amending or terminating
any Company Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or 
policy in effect from time to time, (iii) shall be construed as an amendment
of any Company Employee Plan or Parent Employee Plan, or (iv) shall create any
third-party beneficiary rights in any director, officer, employee or
individual  Person, including any present or former employee, officer,
director or individual independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent of such individual).

Section 7.06 _Financing_.

 


 

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to  be
done, all things necessary to obtain the Debt Financing including (i) using
reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter
and in all material respects comply with all of their respective obligations 
thereunder and (B) negotiate, enter into and deliver the definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions not less favorable in the
aggregate, to Parent than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including,  as necessary, the "market flex" provisions contained in any
related fee letter) by the Closing Date, and (ii) using reasonable best
efforts to satisfy (or if determined advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver
of) on a timely basis all  conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing within
Parent's (or its Subsidiary's) control and to comply with all of its
obligations pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters or other definitive
agreements related thereto to the extent the  failure to comply with such
obligations would adversely impact the timing of the Closing or the
availability at the Closing of sufficient aggregate proceeds of the Debt
Financing to consummate the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement. In
the event that all conditions to funding the commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters have been satisfied, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable  best
efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related
fees and expenses on the Closing Date. Parent shall use its reasonable best 
efforts to enforce all of its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters. Parent
and/or Merger Sub shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due
and payable, all fees and other amounts under the Debt Commitment Letters.

 


 

 

(b) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
and such portion is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (except in accordance with the express terms set forth  in the
Debt Commitment Letters, including as a result of the entry into definitive
agreements for a "Qualifying Term Loan Facility" under the applicable Debt
Commitment Letters with commitments subject to substantially the same
conditions  as those set forth in the applicable Debt Commitment Letters or
unless concurrently replaced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by commitments
subject to substantially the same conditions as those set forth in the
applicable Debt Commitment  Letters from other Financing Sources or from
proceeds of other sources of financing or cash), Parent and Merger Sub shall
(i) use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event,  alternative debt financing for any
such portion from alternative debt sources on terms and conditions, taken as a
whole, no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter  (taking into account any
"market flex" provisions thereof) and in an amount that will still enable
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (" _Alternative Financing_ "), and (ii) promptly notify the Company
of such unavailability and the reason therefor. If obtained, Parent shall 
deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all commitment letters and
other definitive agreements (including redacted copies of fee letters,
removing only fee amounts, the rates and amounts included in the "market flex"
provisions  and certain other economic terms (none of which could adversely
affect the amounts, availability, timing or conditionality of the Debt
Financing)) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to provide Parent or the  Surviving Corporation with Alternative Financing.

 


 

 

 

91  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the Company's prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), permit any
amendment, modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy  under,
any Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement related thereto unless
the terms of such Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreement related
thereto, in each case as so amended, modified or waived, are substantially 
similar to those in such Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreement
related thereto, prior to giving effect to such amendment, modification or
waiver (other than economic terms, which shall be as good as or better for
Parent and  Merger Sub than those in such Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive agreement relating thereto prior to giving effect to such
amendment, modification or waiver); _provided_ that in the case of amendments
or modifications or waivers of any Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreement relating thereto, such amendment, modification or waiver would  not
reasonably be expected to (i) (A) add additional conditions precedent that
would adversely affect the ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub
timely consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise  adversely affect the ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub
timely consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B)
make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or the satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining  the Debt Financing materially less likely to occur,
(ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or (iii) materially and
adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Debt Commitment  Letters or the definitive agreements relating
thereto, it being understood and agreed that in any event, Parent may amend
any of the Debt Commitment Letters or any definitive agreement relating
thereto to add lenders, arrangers,  bookrunners, agents, managers or similar
entities that have not executed such Debt Commitment Letters as of such time
and consent to the assignment of lending commitments under the Debt Commitment
Letters to other lenders.

 


 

 

(d) Parent shall provide the Company with prompt written notice of the receipt
of any notice or other communication from any Financing Source with respect to
such Financing Source's failure or anticipated failure to fund  its
commitments under any Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreement in
connection therewith in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render
it unable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent  shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status of Parent's and its Subsidiaries' efforts to consummate
the Debt Financing, including providing copies of any amendment, modification
or replacement of  the Debt Commitment Letter (provided that any fee letter
may be redacted to remove fee amounts, the rates and amounts included in the
"market flex" provisions and certain other economic terms (none of which could
adversely affect the  amounts, availability, timing or conditionality of the
Debt Financing)). Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any (i)
material breach or material default by any party to the Debt Commitment
Letters or the definitive agreements  related thereto of which Parent obtains
knowledge, (ii) actual or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing
withdrawal, repudiation, or termination of any of the Debt Commitment Letters
or such definitive agreements, or (iii)  material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or such
definitive agreements with respect to the obligations to fund the Debt
Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded  at Closing.

 


 

 

 

92  

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon Parent or 
Merger Sub obtaining any financing.

 


 

 

Section 7.07 _New CVR Agreement_. At or immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time, Parent will execute and deliver, and Parent will cause the New
CVR Trustee to execute and deliver, the New CVR Agreement,  subject to any
changes to the New CVR Agreement that are requested by the New CVR Trustee and
approved prior to the Merger Effective Time by Parent and the Company (which
approval, in the case of the Company, shall not be unreasonably  withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 


 

 

ARTICLE VIII 
  
  COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

 


 

 

The parties hereto agree that:

 


 

 

Section 8.01 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 


 

 

(a) All information furnished pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to
the letter agreement, dated as of November 23, 2018 (as amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with its  terms, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company. Upon
reasonable  notice, during normal business hours during the period from the
date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Merger Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement, solely for purposes of furthering the Merger
and the other  transactions contemplated hereby or integration planning
relating thereto, (i) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
afford to Parent and its Representatives, reasonable access, to all of its
properties, books, contracts  and records, and (ii) the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent all other
information not made available pursuant to clause (i) of this _Section
8.01(a)_ concerning its businesses, properties  and personnel as the other
may reasonably request (in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii), in a
manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). During such  period described in
the immediately preceding sentence, upon reasonable notice and subject to
Applicable Law and during normal business hours, the Company shall instruct
its pertinent Representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent in  its
review of any such information provided or made available pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence. No information or knowledge obtained in any
review or investigation pursuant to this _Section 8.01_ shall affect or be 
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company or Parent
pursuant to this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

93  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.01_ , _Section
8.02_ or _Section 8.03_ , none of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide  access to, disclose
information to or assist or cooperate with the other party, in each case if
such access, disclosure, assistance or cooperation (i) would, as reasonably
determined based on the advice of outside counsel, jeopardize any  attorney-
client privilege with respect to such information, or (ii) would contravene
any Applicable Law or Contract to which the applicable party is a subject or
bound; _provided_ that the Company and Parent shall, and each shall  cause
its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which such
restrictions apply (including redacting such information (A) to remove
references concerning  valuation, (B) as necessary to comply with any
Contract in effect on the date hereof or after the date hereof and (C) as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client, work-product or other
privilege or confidentiality concerns) and to  provide such information as to
the applicable matter as can be conveyed. Each of the Company and Parent may,
as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under  this _Section 8.01_ or
_Section 8.02_ as "Outside Counsel Only Material". Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of
the recipient and, subject to any additional  confidentiality or joint
defense agreement the parties may mutually propose and enter into, will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in  advance from the source
of the materials (the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel.

 


 

 

Section 8.02 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 


 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Section
8.02(b)_ and _Section 8.02(c)_ , each of the Company and Parent shall, and
each shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective  reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to
consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby as  promptly
as practicable, including (i) (A) preparing and filing as promptly as
practicable with any Governmental Authority or other Third Party all
documentation to effect all Filings as are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate  the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (B)
using reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, and
thereafter maintain, all Consents required to be obtained from any
Governmental Authority or other  Third Party that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby,
and complying with the terms and conditions of each Consent (including by
supplying as promptly as reasonably  practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or
other applicable Antitrust Laws), and (C) cooperating, to the extent
reasonable, with the other parties hereto in their  efforts to comply with
their obligations under this Agreement, including in seeking to obtain as
promptly as practicable any required Consents and (ii) using reasonable best
efforts to contest (which includes by litigation) any (A)  action, suit,
investigation or proceeding brought by any Governmental Authority in a court
of competent jurisdiction seeking to enjoin, restrain, prevent, prohibit or
make illegal consummation of the Merger or any of the other  transactions
contemplated hereby or seeking damages or to impose any terms or conditions in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby or (B) Order that has been entered by a court of competent 
jurisdiction that enjoins, restrains, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal
consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby or imposes any damages, terms or conditions in connection with the
Merger or any of  the other transactions contemplated hereby. The parties
understand and agree that, subject to _Section 8.02(b)_ and _Section 8.02(g)_
, Parent's obligation to use its reasonable best efforts set forth in this
_Section  8.02(a)_ includes taking and agreeing to take all actions and doing
or agreeing to do all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable
Law (including divestitures, hold separate arrangements, the termination,
assignment,  novation or modification of Contracts (or portions thereof) or
other business relationships, the acceptance of restrictions on business
operations and the entry into other commitments and limitations) to satisfy
the conditions set forth  in _Section 9.01_ _(f)_ or _Section 9.01(c)_ (if
the injunction or other Order  relates to any Antitrust Law) and to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 


 

 

 

94  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 8.02(a)_ or anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement will obligate or require Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take or cause  to be
taken any action (or refrain or cause to refrain from taking any action) or
agree or cause to agree to any term, condition or limitation (including, in
each case, any of the actions or items referred to in the last sentence of
_Section         8.02(a)_ ) as a condition to, or in connection with,
(i) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period relating to
the Merger under the HSR Act, (ii) any Foreign Antitrust Law or (iii)
obtaining any other Consent from  a Governmental Authority or otherwise, in
each case if such action (or refraining from such action), term, condition or
limitation would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a material adverse  effect on the financial condition,
business or results of operations of the Company, Parent and their respective
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger.

 


 

 

(c) Without limiting in any respect Parent's obligations under this _Section
8.02_ , __ Parent shall have the right to (i) direct, devise and implement the
strategy for obtaining any necessary approval of, for responding to any
request from, inquiry or investigation by (including directing the timing, 
nature and substance of all such responses), and shall have the right to lead
all meetings and communications (including any negotiations) with, any
Governmental Authority that has authority to enforce any Antitrust Law and
(ii) without  limiting the generality of clause (i) of this _Section 8.02(c)_
or the obligations of the Company under this _Section 8.02_ , control the
defense and settlement of any litigation, action, suit, investigation or
proceeding  brought by or before any Governmental Authority that has
authority to enforce any Antitrust Law. Parent shall consult with the Company
in a reasonable manner and consider in good faith the views and comments of
the Company in connection  with the foregoing.

 


 

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company
and Parent shall, and each shall cause its Subsidiaries to, as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, make all Filings  with all
Governmental Authorities that are necessary, proper or advisable under this
Agreement or Applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, including: (i) not later than
ten  (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement (unless the
parties otherwise agree to another time period), the Company and Parent each
making an appropriate Filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the
HSR Act with  the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and requesting early termination of the
waiting period under the  HSR Act; (ii) as promptly as practicable following

available their respective Representatives to, upon reasonable request, any
Governmental Authority, in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii), in
connection with (A) the preparation of any Filing made by or on their behalf
to  any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby or (B) any Governmental Authority
investigation, review or approval process.

 


 

 

(f) Subject to _Section 8.02(c)_ , Applicable Laws relating to the sharing of
information and the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement and
all other agreements entered into by the parties to this  Agreement, and
subject to the proviso at the end of this _Section 8.02(f)_ , each of the
Company and Parent shall, and each shall cause its Subsidiaries to: (i) (A) as
far in advance as practicable, notify the other party of, and  provide the
other party with an opportunity to consult with respect to, any Filing or non-
ministerial communication or inquiry it or any of its Affiliates intends to
make with any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are  the
subject of this Agreement, (B) prior to submitting any such Filing or making
any such communication or inquiry, the submitting or making party shall
provide the other party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review,
and shall  consider in good faith the comments of the other party and such
other party's Representatives in connection with any such Filing,
communication or inquiry, and (C) promptly following the submission of such
Filing or making of such  communication or inquiry, provide the other party
with a copy of any such Filing or, if in written form, communication or
inquiry, or, if in oral form, a summary of any such communication or inquiry;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 8.02(f)_ _(i)_ shall not  apply
to any initial filings made pursuant to the HSR Act; (ii) as promptly as
practicable following receipt, furnish the other party with a copy of any
Filing or, if in written form, non-ministerial communication or inquiry, or,
if in  oral form, a summary of any non-ministerial communication or inquiry,
that it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority
relating to matters that are the subject of this Agreement; and (iii)
coordinate and  reasonably cooperate with the other party in exchanging such
information and providing such other assistance as the other party may
reasonably request in connection with this _Section 8.02_ (including in
seeking early termination of  any applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act). Subject to _Section 8.02(c)_ , none of the Company, Parent or their
respective Representatives shall agree to participate in any meeting or non-
ministerial conference (including by  telephone) with any Governmental
Authority, or any member of the staff of any Governmental Authority, in

materials provided to the other party pursuant to this _Section 8.02_ may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company
or any of their  Subsidiaries.

 


 

 

 

96  

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall (i) Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Company or any of its
Affiliates be required to agree to take or enter into any action which is 
not conditioned upon, and shall become effective from and after, the Closing,
or (ii) the Company or any of its Affiliates agree to any obligation,
restriction, requirement, limitation, qualification, condition, remedy or
other action in  connection with obtaining the Consents under Antitrust Laws
required to be obtained by the parties or their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger without the prior written consent of Parent
(including in connection with  obtaining any of the governmental approvals
described in _Section 8.02(b)_ ) (which consent shall not be withheld, delayed
or conditioned if doing so would be inconsistent with Parent's obligations
under this _Section 8.02)_ ,  but, if requested by Parent in writing, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, subject to clause (i) of
this _Section 8.02(g)_ , take any such actions to obtain any of the
governmental approvals described in _Section         8.02(b)_.

 


 

 

Section 8.03 _Certain Filings; SEC Matters_.

 


 

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, (i) the
Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC a proxy
statement relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent 
Stockholder Meeting (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the
" _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") in preliminary form, and (ii) Parent
shall prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 which
shall include the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (together with all
amendments and supplements  thereto, the " _Registration Statement_ ")
relating to the registration of the shares of Parent  Common Stock to be
issued to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Parent Share
Issuance and the New CVRs to be issued to the stockholders of the Company in
connection with the Merger. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and  the
Registration Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and other Applicable
Law.

 


 

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC as promptly as
practicable after its filing, and Parent shall use its reasonable best 
efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the 1933
Act as promptly as practicable after its filing and keep the Registration
Statement effective for so long as necessary to consummate the Merger and, if
required  by Applicable Law, to have the New CVR Agreement become qualified
under the Trust Indenture Act. Each of the Company and Parent shall, as
promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof, provide the other party
with copies of any  written comments and advise the other party of any oral
comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement received by such party from the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority, including any  request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration
Statement, and shall provide the other with copies of all material or
substantive correspondence between it and its  Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or any other Governmental Authority, on the other hand,
related to the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the
Registration Statement or mailing the Joint Proxy  Statement/Prospectus or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the
Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate and provide the other party and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such document or  response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and
consider in good faith the comments of the other party or such other party's
Representatives in connection with any such document or response. None of
the  Company, Parent or any of their respective Representatives shall agree
to participate in any material or substantive meeting or conference (including
by telephone) with the SEC, or any member of the staff thereof, in respect of
the  Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by the
SEC, allows the other party to participate. Parent shall advise the Company,
promptly  after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of
the Registration Statement, and the issuance of any stop order relating
thereto or the suspension of the qualification of shares of Parent Common
Stock for offering or sale  in any jurisdiction, and each of the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or
suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

 


 

 

 

97  

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take any other action required to be taken by it under the 1933 Act, the 1934
Act, the DGCL and the rules of the NYSE and Nasdaq in connection  with the
filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement, and the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders
of each of the Company and Parent thereunder. Subject to _Section 6.02_ , 
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the Company Board
Recommendation, and, subject to _Section 7.02_ , the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall include the Parent Board Recommendation.

 


 

 

(d) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do or cause to be done all things, necessary,
proper or advisable under Applicable Laws and the rules and policies of the 
NYSE and the SEC to enable the listing of the Parent Common Stock and the New
CVRs being registered pursuant to the Registration Statement on the NYSE (or
other national securities exchange) no later than the Merger Effective Time, 
subject to official notice of issuance. Parent shall also use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "blue sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement ( _provided_ that in no event shall Parent be required to
qualify to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified
or file a general consent to service of process).

 


 

 

(e) Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
(to the extent reasonably available to the applicable party)  stockholders
and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in
connection with any statement, Filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to
the  SEC or the NYSE in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Registration Statement and the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus: _provided_ , _however_ , that neither party
shall use any such information for any purposes other than those contemplated
by this Agreement unless such party obtains the prior written consent of the
other. In addition, each of  the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide information concerning it necessary to enable the
Company and Parent to prepare required pro forma financial statements and
related footnotes in connection with the  preparation of the Registration
Statement and/or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

 


 

 

 

98  

(f) If at any time prior to the later of the Company Approval Time and the
Parent Approval Time, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be 
discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to either of the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that either of such documents would not include any 
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall 
promptly notify the other party hereto, and each party shall use reasonable
best efforts to, and reasonably cooperate with the other to, promptly prepare
and file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such 
information and, to the extent required under Applicable Law, disseminate such
amendment or supplement to the stockholders of each of the Company and Parent.

 


 

 

Section 8.04 _Stockholder Meetings_.

 


 

 

(a) Promptly following the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (and,
in the case of clause (iii), within forty (40) days of the Company Record
Date), the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, in accordance  with
Applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents, (i) establish a
record date (the " _Company Record Date_ ") for, duly call and give notice of
a meeting of the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote on the Merger
(the " _Company  Stockholder Meeting_ ") at which meeting the Company shall
seek the Company Stockholder Approval (and will use reasonable best efforts to
conduct "broker searches"  in a manner to enable the Company Record Date to
be held promptly following the effectiveness of the Registration Statement),
(ii) cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (and all other proxy materials
for the Company Stockholder  Meeting) to be mailed to its stockholders and
(iii) duly convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to

Approval to be received at the Company Stockholder Meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof, and shall comply with  all legal requirements
applicable to the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the
Company Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ that  the Company may,
notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written consent of Parent,
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting (A) if, after consultation
with Parent, the Company believes in good faith that such  adjournment or
postponement is reasonably necessary to allow reasonable additional time to
(1) solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, or (2) distribute any supplement or amendment to the Joint  Proxy
Statement/Prospectus that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined
in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under
Applicable Law and for such supplement or amendment to be reviewed by the 
Company's stockholders prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, (B) for an
absence of a quorum or (C) if the Parent Stockholder Meeting has been
adjourned or postponed by Parent in accordance with _Section 8.04(b)_ , to the
extent  necessary to enable the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent
Stockholder Meeting to be held within a single period of twenty-four (24)
consecutive hours as contemplated by _Section 8.04(d)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting more than a total of three (3) times
pursuant to clause  (A)(1) or (B) of the immediately preceding sentence, and
no such postponement or adjournment pursuant to clause (A)(1) or (B) of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be, without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to  be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), for a period exceeding ten (10) Business Days. Without the prior
written consent of Parent, the matters contemplated by the Company Stockholder
Approval shall be the only matters (other  than matters of procedure and
maters required by Applicable Law to be voted on by the Company's stockholders
in connection therewith) that the Company shall propose to be voted on by the
stockholders of the Company at the Company  Stockholder Meeting.

 


 

 

 

99  

(b) Promptly following the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (and,
in the case of clause (iii), within forty (40) days of the Company Record
Date, subject to an extension of up to fifteen (15) additional Business  Days
as contemplated by the last sentence of this _Section 8.04(b)_ ), Parent
shall, in  consultation with the Company, in accordance with Applicable Law
and the Parent Organizational Documents, (i) establish a record date (which
date shall be the same as the Company Record Date) for, duly call and give
notice of a meeting of  the stockholders of Parent entitled to vote on the
Parent Share Issuance (the " _Parent Stockholder Meeting_ ") at which meeting
Parent shall seek the Parent Stockholder Approval (and will use reasonable
best efforts to conduct "broker searches" in a manner to enable the such
record date to be held on such date), (ii) cause the  Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (and all other proxy materials for the Parent Stockholder
Meeting) to be mailed to its stockholders and (iii) duly convene and hold the
Parent Stockholder Meeting. Subject to _Section 7.02_ , Parent  shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part to
cause the Parent Stockholder Approval to be received at the Parent 
Stockholder Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and shall
comply with all legal requirements applicable to the Parent Stockholder
Meeting. Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company,
adjourn,  postpone or otherwise delay the Parent Stockholder Meeting;
_provided_ that Parent may, notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior
written consent of the Company, adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholder
Meeting (A) if, after consultation with  the Company, Parent believes in good
faith that such adjournment or postponement is reasonably necessary to allow
reasonable additional time to (1) solicit additional proxies necessary to
obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval, or (2)  distribute any supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus that the Board of Directors
of Parent has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel is necessary under Applicable Law and for such  supplement or
amendment to be reviewed by Parent's stockholders prior to the Parent
Stockholder Meeting, (B) for an absence of a quorum or (C) if the Company
Stockholder Meeting has been adjourned or postponed by the Company in
accordance  with _Section 8.04(a)_ , to the extent necessary to enable the

(50%)".

_Section 10.01(b)(iii)_ , then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its
designee) an amount equal to all out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses 
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and any of its

hereby (including obtaining the Debt Financing), subject to cap on such
reimbursement of  $40,000,000 (" _Parent Fee Reimbursement_ "), within one
Business Day after the date of the  termination of the Agreement (in the case
of any such termination by Parent) or at or prior to, and as a condition
precedent to, the termination of the Agreement (in the case of any such
termination by the Company).

 


 

 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.01(b)(iv)_ , then Parent shall pay to the Company (or its
designee) an amount equal to all out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses 
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Company and any of its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, subject to cap on such reimbursement of $40,000,000 (the " _Company
Fee Reimbursement_ "), within one Business Day after the date of the
termination of the Agreement  (in the case of any such termination by the
Company) or concurrently with, and as a condition precedent to, the
termination of the Agreement (in the case of any such termination by Parent).

 


 

 

(e) Any payment of the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee,
the Parent Fee Reimbursement or the Company Fee Reimbursement shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account  designated in

109  

(f) The parties agree and understand that (x) in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, and in
no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination  Fee on more
than one occasion, in each case, under any circumstances, and (y) except in
the case of fraud or Willful Breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement by the other party, (1) in no event shall Parent be  entitled,
pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ , to receive an amount greater than the
Company Termination Fee and any applicable additional amounts pursuant the
last two sentences of this _Section 10.03(f)_ (such additional  amounts,
collectively, the " _Parent Additional Amounts_ "), and (2) in no event shall
the  Company be entitled, pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ , to receive an
amount greater than the Parent Termination Fee and any applicable additional
amounts pursuant to _Section 6.03(a)_ and/or the last two sentences of this
_  Section 10.03(f)_ (such additional amounts, collectively, the " _Company
Additional Amounts_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach of any covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement by the other party, (i) if Parent
receives the Company  Termination Fee and any applicable Parent Additional
Amounts from the Company pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ , or if the Company
receives the Parent Termination Fee and any applicable Company Additional
Amounts from Parent pursuant  to this _Section 10.03_ , such payment shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party against the paying party
and its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or future partners,
equityholders, managers,  members, Affiliates and Representatives, and none
of the paying party, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
former, current or future partners, equityholders, managers, members,
Affiliates or Representatives shall have any  further liability or
obligation, in each case relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) if (A) Parent or Merger Sub receive
any payments from the Company in respect of any breach of  this Agreement and
thereafter Parent receives the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 10.03_ or (B) the Company receives any payments from Parent or Merger
Sub in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter  the Company
receives the Parent Termination Fee, the amount of such Company Termination
Fee or such Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be reduced by the
aggregate amount of such payments made by the party paying the Company 
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, in respect of
any such breaches (in each case, after taking into account any Parent
Additional Amounts or Company Additional Amounts, as applicable). The parties
acknowledge  that the agreements contained in this _Section 10.03_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and that any
amounts payable  pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ do not constitute a
penalty. Accordingly, if any party fails to promptly pay any amount due
pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ , such party shall also pay any out-of-pocket
costs and expenses  (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred
by the party entitled to such payment in connection with a legal action to
enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount against the
party failing to promptly pay  such amount. Any amount not paid when due
pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ shall bear interest from the date such amount
is due until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in
The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect on the date of such
payment.

 


 

 

 

110  

(g) None of the Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Company or
any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law, or equity, in 
contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any Person that is
an Affiliate of the Company shall have any rights or claims directly against
any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder. The foregoing shall
not  impair, supplement, or otherwise modify any of the commitments and other
obligations that the Financing Sources have under any Debt Commitment Letter
and/or any definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing to Parent or
Merger Sub or  any of the rights of Parent or Merger Sub against any of the
Financing Sources under any Debt Commitment Letter and/or any definitive
agreement related to the Debt Financing and this _Section 10.03(g)_ shall not
limit the rights of  the Company or any Person that is an Affiliate of the
Company from and after the Merger Effective Time under any Debt Commitment
Letter or any definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing (but not, for
the avoidance of doubt, under  this Agreement) to the extent the Company or
any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company are party thereto.

relieve Parent or  Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or otherwise alter
or change any obligation of any other party hereto or delay the consummation
of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 


 

 

Section 11.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all disputes, claims,
actions, suits or proceedings based upon, arising out of or related to  this

agrees that any dispute, claim, action, suit or proceeding based upon, arising

jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within  the State of
Delaware), (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that any such
dispute, claim, action, suit or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient 
court and agrees not to plead or claim the same and (vi) agrees that it shall
not bring any dispute, claim, action, suit or proceeding based upon, arising
out of or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated

114  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto
acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any action or proceeding, whether
in law or in equity, whether in contract or tort or otherwise, involving  the

Section 11.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO  INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A

any number of counterparts, including by facsimile or by email  with .pdf

Section 11.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or  other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or 
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify  this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest

Section 11.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable harm would occur and that the parties would not have  any
adequate remedy at law (a) for any breach of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or (b) in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is
accordingly  agreed that, except where this Agreement is validly terminated
in accordance with _Section 10.01_ , the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to  specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, without proof of actual damages, and each party further agrees to
waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy. The parties  further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section 11.13_ , a party shall not in any respect waive
its right to any other form of relief that may be available to a party under
this Agreement, including,  subject to _Section 10.03(f)_ , monetary damages
in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section 11.13_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing contained in this
_Section 11.13_ shall  require any party to institute any proceeding for (or
limit any party's right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance
under this _Section 11.13_ before exercising any termination right under
_Section 10.01_   (and/or pursuing damages), nor shall the commencement of
any action pursuant to this _Section 11.13_ or anything contained in this
_Section 11.13_ restrict or limit any party's right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance  with the terms of _Section 10.0_ 1 or pursue any
other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company or Parent be
entitled to both (i) specific  performance to cause the other party to
consummate the Closing and (ii) the payment of the Parent Termination Fee or
the Company Termination Fee, as applicable.
