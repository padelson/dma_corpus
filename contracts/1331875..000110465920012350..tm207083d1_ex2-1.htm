each Company Ordinary Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
First Effective Time (the " _Sha res_") (excluding Dissenting Shares, but
including Company Restricted Stock Rights) shall be canceled and shall, by
virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of the holder

"), an amount equal to $12.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash
Consideration_ ");

  



  

(ii) for each Share with respect to which an election to receive
stock has been effectively made and not revoked (the  " _Stock Election
Shares_ "), a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Stock

Cash Consideration or Stock Consideration or a combination of both, as
provided in _Section 2.05_ ,

  



  

in each case, upon surrender of the Certificate representing such Shares as

(b) Each Share that is owned by the Company as treasury stock or
otherwise or by any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the First

19

(e) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the
Closing or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
VIII_ , none of Parent, the Merger Subs or any other Subsidiary thereof shall

Section 2.05 _Exchange Mechanics; Proration_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Registration
Statement, a form of election (the " _Election Form_ ") in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company. Not less than twenty (20) days prior to
the Election Deadline, the Exchange Agent shall mail the Election Form to all
Persons who are record holders of Company Ordinary Shares (other than the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II
or any other Subsidiary thereof, which shall be subject to _Section 2.04(d)_
) and Company Restricted Stock Rights as of the close of the fifth (5th)
Business Day prior to the filing of the Registration Statement.

  



  

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial
owner through customary documentation and instructions) of Shares to specify
(i) the number of Shares with respect to which such holder elects to receive
the Cash Consideration, (ii) the number of Shares with respect to which such
holder elects to receive the Stock Consideration or (iii) that such holder
makes no election with respect to such holder's Shares. Any Shares with
respect to which the Exchange Agent does not receive a properly completed
Election Form prior to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the business day that is
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date or such other date as
Parent and the Company will, prior to the Closing, mutually agree (the "
_Election Deadline_ ") shall be deemed to be No Election Shares. Parent and
the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. If the
Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be
similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the Company shall
promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled
Election Deadline.

  



  

(c) Any election made pursuant to this _Section 2.05_ will have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent will have actually received a
properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline. Any Election
Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting it, by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. After an
election has been validly made pursuant to this _Section 2.05_ , any further
registration of transfer of the corresponding Shares made on the stock
transfer books of the Company following such election shall be automatically
deemed to be a revocation of such election. In the event an Election Form is
revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the Shares represented by such
Election Form shall be deemed to be No Election Shares, except to the extent
a subsequent election is properly made prior to the Election Deadline.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange
Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election,
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the
Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of
Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall
be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election
Form. Any election shall be automatically deemed revoked if this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if the product of the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares and
the Cash Consideration (such product being the " _Elected Cash Consideration_
") exceeds the Maximum Cash Amount, then:

  



  

(i) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be
exchanged for the Stock Consideration; and

  



  

(ii) a portion of the Cash Election Shares of each holder of Shares
shall be exchanged for the Cash Consideration, with such portion being equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of such holder's Cash
Election Shares by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Maximum
Cash Amount and the denominator of which will be the Elected Cash
Consideration, with the remaining portion of such holder's Cash Election
Shares being exchanged for the Stock Consideration.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if the Elected Cash Consideration is less than the Maximum Cash
Amount (such difference being the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), then:

  



  

(i) all Cash Election Shares shall be exchanged for the Cash
Consideration; and

  



  

(ii) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be
treated in the following manner: (A) if the Shortfall Amount is less than or
equal to the product of the aggregate number of No Election Shares and the
Cash Consideration (the " _No Election Value_ "), then (1) all Stock Election
Shares shall be exchanged for the Stock Consideration and (2) the No Election
Shares of each holder of Shares shall be exchanged for the Cash Consideration
in respect of that number of No Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of No Election Shares of such holder by (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Amount and the denominator
of which is the No Election Value, with the remaining portion of such
holder's No Election Shares (if any) being exchanged for the Stock
Consideration or (B) if the Shortfall Amount exceeds the No Election Value,
then (1) all No Election Shares will be exchanged for the Cash Consideration
and (2) a portion of the Stock Election Shares of each holder of Shares will
be exchanged for the Cash Consideration, with such portion being equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares of
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by
which the Shortfall Amount exceeds the No Election Value, and the denominator
of which is the product obtained by multiplying the aggregate number of Stock
Election Shares by the Cash Consideration, with the remaining portion of such
holder's Stock Election Shares being exchanged for the Stock Consideration.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if the Elected Cash Consideration equals the Maximum Cash Amount,
then:

  



  

(i) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration; and

  



  

(ii) all Stock Election Shares and all No Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

  



  

(g) Unless the properly completed Election Form provides otherwise,
for all purposes of this _Section 2.05_ and in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), (i) a holder will be treated as having
surrendered, in exchange for the total amount of the Cash Consideration, if
any, to be paid to such holder under this Section 2.05 (with respect to a
holder, the " _Cash Portion_ "), the number of Company Ordinary Shares owned
by such holder as to which such holder has a right to receive cash pursuant
to this _Section 2.05_ ; and (ii) for purposes of clause (i), the Certificates
surrendered by a holder in exchange for such holder\'s Cash Portion will be
deemed to be: (A) first, of those Certificates evidencing shares held by such
holder for more than one year before the Mergers within the meaning of
Section 1223 of the Code, if any, those Certificates with the highest U.S.
federal income tax basis, in descending order until such Certificates are
exhausted or the Cash Portion for such holder is fully paid, then (B) of all
other of such holder\'s Certificates, those Certificates with the highest U.S.
federal income tax basis, in descending order until the Cash Portion for such
holder is fully paid.

  



  

Section 2.06 _T_ _reatment of Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) At the First Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Right
that is outstanding and unvested at the First Effective Time shall
immediately vest and shall be canceled and shall, by virtue of the First
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
2.04(a)_ (including the right to elect, subject to the terms of _Sections
2.05(c)-(g)_ , to receive cash and/or stock in connection with such
conversion).

  



  

(b) Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, each unvested
Company Stock Option, whether time or performance-based, shall be converted
to a Company Stock Option that vests solely based on the passage of time
without any ongoing performance-vesting conditions (the " _Adjusted Company
Stock Option_ "); _provided_ , that (i) with respect to performance vesting
conditions tied to the achievement of Company stock price goals, the number
of Company Ordinary Shares subject to each such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be the number of Company
Ordinary Shares that would performance vest upon the achievement of a per
Company Ordinary Share price equal to the greater of (x) the Cash
Consideration or (y) the Company's stock price achieved at or prior to the
First Effective Time as calculated in accordance with the terms of the Company
Equity Plan; and (ii) with respect to performance vesting conditions tied to
the achievement of Company return on equity (ROE) or other
performance objectives that are not tied to Company stock price, the number
of Company Ordinary Shares subject to each such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be the number of
Company Ordinary Shares that would performance vest upon the achievement of
such performance objectives. In addition, with respect to the Company Stock
Options granted prior to January 1, 2020 only, immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, (I) for purposes of determining the number of such outstanding
Company Stock Options that will be deemed to be vested as of the First
Effective Time, each holder will be credited as though the holder had served
a number of days in the applicable vesting period that is equal to two (2)
times the number of days that have elapsed between the grant date of such
Company Stock Option and the date on which the First Effective Time occurs and
(II) each remaining vesting date for each such unvested Adjusted Company
Stock Option shall be moved to an earlier date calculated from the grant
date of such unvested Adjusted Company Stock Option as follows: the number of
days between the grant date of such Company Stock Option and the original
vesting date, minus the number of days that have elapsed between the grant
date of such Company Stock Option and the date on which the First Effective
Time occurs.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(c) At the First Effective Time, each vested Company Stock Option and
each unvested Adjusted Company Stock Option, in each case, which is
outstanding at the First Effective Time shall, by virtue of the First Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent
an option to purchase Company Ordinary Shares and be converted into an option
to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (such option, a "
_Converted Stock Option_ ") equal to the product (with the result rounded
down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of Company Ordinary Shares
subject to each such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the First
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per
share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price
per Company Ordinary Share of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the First Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; provided, however,
that the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to the Converted Stock Option shall be determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Except
as specifically provided in this _Section 2.06_ , immediately following the
First Effective Time, each Converted Stock Option shall continue to be
governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting, forfeiture and
exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time, provided that any
unvested Converted Stock Options shall be subject to the accelerated
vesting as contemplated by the terms of the corresponding Company Stock
Option in respect of an involuntary termination of the holder's service
relationship within two (2) years following the Closing Date.

  



  

(d) Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, each unvested
Company Phantom Unit, whether time or performance-based, shall be converted
to a Company Phantom Unit that vests solely based on the passage of time
without any ongoing performance-vesting conditions (the " _Adjusted Company
Phantom Unit_ "); provided, that (i) the number of Company Ordinary Shares
subject to an Adjusted Company Phantom Unit immediately prior to the First
Effective Time shall be determined assuming achievement of target level of
performance. In addition, with respect to the Company Phantom Units granted
prior to January 1, 2020 only, immediately prior to the First Effective Time,
(I) for purposes of determining the number of such outstanding Company Phantom
Units that will be deemed to be vested as of the First Effective Time, each
holder will be credited as though the holder had served a number of days in
the applicable vesting period that is equal to two (2) times the number of
days that have elapsed between the grant date of such Company Phantom Unit
and the date on which the First Effective Time occurs and (II) each remaining
vesting date for each such unvested Adjusted Company Phantom Unit shall be
moved to an earlier date calculated from the grant date of such unvested
Adjusted Company Phantom Unit as follows: the number of days between the
grant date of such Company Phantom Unit and the original vesting date, minus
the number of days that have elapsed between the grant date of such Company
Phantom Unit and the date on which the First Effective Time occurs.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

(e) At the First Effective Time, each vested Company Phantom Unit and
each unvested Adjusted Company Phantom Unit, in each case, which is
outstanding at the First Effective Time shall cease to represent a phantom
stock unit denominated in Company Ordinary Shares and be converted into a
phantom stock unit denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent
Phantom Unit_ ") entitling the holder to receive the number of Parent Phantom
Units equal to the product (with the result rounded to the nearest two
decimal places) of (i) the number of Company Ordinary Shares subject to each
such Company Phantom Unit immediately prior to the First Effective Time
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided in
this _Section 2.06_ , immediately following the First Effective Time, each
Parent Phantom Unit shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions (including vesting, forfeiture and exercisability terms) as were
applicable to the corresponding Company Phantom Unit immediately prior to the
First Effective Time, provided, that, (i) any unvested Parent Phantom Units
shall be subject to the accelerated vesting as contemplated by the terms of
the corresponding Company Phantom Unit in respect of an involuntary
termination of the holder's service relationship within two (2) years
following the Closing Date; and (ii) to the extent a payment pursuant in this
_Section 2.06_ would trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code,
such payment shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not
trigger such Tax or penalty.

  



  

(f) Prior to the First Effective Time, the board of directors of the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company to, take any and all actions
necessary or appropriate (under the Company Equity Plans, applicable Law, the
applicable award agreements or otherwise) to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 2.06_ and to ensure that, from and after the
First Effective Time, each holder of Company Restricted Stock Rights shall
have no rights with respect to any cancelled Company Restricted Stock Rights,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto, and
each holder of Company Stock Options or Company Phantom Units shall have no
rights with respect to any converted Company Stock Options or Company Phantom
Units, except the right to receive a grant of Converted Stock Options or
Parent Phantom Units, respectively. Parent shall file with the SEC, as soon
as practicable following the First Effective Time, a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor form or other appropriate form) or Form S-3 (or
any successor form or other appropriate form), to the extent such forms are
available, relating to such Parent Common Stock.

  



  

Section 2.07 _Treatment of Company Preferred Shares_.

  



  

(a) Each Series A Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the First Effective Time (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall occur
immediately following the purchase of such Series A Shares by the Parent
pursuant to the Series A Preferred Share Purchase Agreement) shall be
surrendered for no consideration, canceled and cease to exist and no payment
or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

(b) Each Series B Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the First Effective Time shall be canceled and shall, by virtue of the First
Merger and without any action the part of the holder thereof, be converted
automatically into the right to receive a number of validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (i) the
Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Series B Certificate of
Designation) in respect of such Series B Shares as of the First Effective Time
_divided by_ (ii) the Reference Parent Common Stock Price.

  



  

Section 2.08 _Treatment of Company Warrants_. At the First Effective
Time, each Company Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time shall, as of the First Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to purchase and receive upon exercise thereof, upon the basis and upon
the terms and conditions specified in such Company Warrant and in lieu of the
Company Ordinary Shares immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable
upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the Merger Consideration
that the holder of such Company Warrant would have received if such holder
had exercised such Company Warrant immediately prior to the First Effective
Time.

  



  

Section 2.09 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any Dissenting Shares shall not be not
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.04(a_ ), but instead at the First Effective Time the holders of Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 238 of the CICL and such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to dissent under Section 238 of the CICL, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares under
Section 238 of the CICL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted at the First Effective Time into, and shall have
become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.04(a)_ , without interest or any other payments. The Company shall serve
prompt notice to Parent of any notices of objection, notices of dissent or
demands for fair value under Section 238 of the CICL of any of the Shares,
attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the CICL and received by the Company, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), or as otherwise required under the CICL, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such notices or
demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing. In the event
that any written notices of objection to the First Merger are served by any
Company Shareholder pursuant to Section 238(2) and in accordance with Section
238(3) of the CICL, the Company shall serve written notice of the
authorization of the First Merger on such Company Shareholders pursuant to
Section 238(4) of the CICL within twenty (20) days of the approval of this
Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby by the
Company Required Vote.

  



  

Section 2.10 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. The Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any
share split, reverse share split, share dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities of a Subsidiary of Parent or the Company or of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Ordinary Shares),
capitalization, extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Ordinary Shares
with a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
First Effective Time; _provided_ that this _Section 2.10_ shall not operate
as a waiver or modification of any obligation of the Company or Parent set
forth in _Section 6.01_ or _Section 6.02_ , respectively.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

Section 2.11 _Intended Tax Treatment of the Mergers_. The Mergers
are intended to be treated as a single integrated transaction for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

Parent shall enter into an agreement (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company) with the Exchange Agent to act as
exchange agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
the Certificates pursuant to this _Article III_ , in the case of certificated
Shares, and automatically, in the case of Book-Entry Shares. Immediately
prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent (a) cash in the aggregate amount required to pay the aggregate Cash
Consideration and (b) book-entry shares representing the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock required to pay the Stock Consideration, in each

herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be used solely for
purposes of paying the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article
III_ and shall not be used to satisfy any other obligation of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Pending distribution of the Exchange Fund in

invest the cash in the Exchange Fund; _provided_ , that (i) no such investment
or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the
Company Shareholders and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the Company
Shareholders in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such investments (A)
shall be obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America,

Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, or certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of domestic
commercial banks with capital exceeding $5,000,000,000 (collectively "
_Permitted Investments_ ") or money market funds that are invested solely in
Permitted Investments and (B) shall have maturities that will not prevent or
delay payments to be made pursuant to this _Article III_. Any income from
investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable solely to Parent. The
Surviving Company shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the
Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger

Section 3.02   _Exch_ _ange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after the First Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that,
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, represented outstanding
Shares subsequently converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, as set forth in _Section 2.04_ (i) a letter of transmittal (a
" _Lette r of Transmittal_") that (A) shall specify that delivery shall be
effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent (or an affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof, together with any bond or indemnity agreement,
as contemplated by _Section 3.06_ ) and (B) shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as the Surviving Company may specify, subject to the
Company's reasonable approval (to be sought prior to the First Effective
Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and executed,
and any other documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Company, (i) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.04_ and (ii) the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.02_ , each such Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the First Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent
to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one
or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon the First Effective
Time (or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares shall be so
converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable and in any event within three
(3) Business Days after the First Effective Time, the Merger Consideration to
which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



  

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate amount of
the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent properly endorsed
or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Exchange
Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable Taxes have been paid.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the First Merger and no dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share and no such fractional share will entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent. As promptly as
practicable after the First Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, acting as
agent for the holders of Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, shall aggregate all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be issued pursuant to
_Section 2.04_ and cause them to be sold on the New York Stock Exchange at
then-prevailing prices and, in lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, any holder of Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall have the right to receive an
amount equal such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from
the sale by the Exchange Agent of shares of such Parent Common Stock, rounded
to the nearest penny, without interest.

Section 3.03   _No Further Ownership Rights_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of the Certificates
in accordance with the terms hereof, in the case of certificated Shares, or
automatically, in the case of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares and, after
the First Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the transfer books of the Surviving Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time. If, after the
First Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article III_ , subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

  



  

Section 3.04   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect
thereto) that remains undistributed to the former Company Shareholders on the
date twelve (12) months after the First Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore
received any applicable Merger Consideration to which such Company
Shareholder is entitled under this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only
to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for
payment of claims with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 3.05   _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Company,
the Final Surviving Company, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or any of their
respective Representatives shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any
part of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Shares two (2) years after the
First Effective Time or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to
the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property
of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law or Order, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal
representatives previously entitled thereto.

  



  

Section 3.06   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent or
the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent or the Surviving Company may direct, or the execution and
delivery by such Person of an indemnity agreement in such form as Parent or
the Surviving Company may direct, in each case as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration.

  



  

   

28

 



    

   



  

Section 3.07   _With_ _holding of Tax_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent, the Surviving Company, any
Affiliate thereof or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Shares, Dissenting Shares, Company Stock Options, Company Phantom
Units, Company Restricted Stock Rights and Company Warrants, such amounts as
Parent, the Surviving Company, any Affiliate thereof or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Company,
any Affiliate thereof, or the Exchange Agent are paid over to the applicable
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law or Order, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent, the Surviving Company, any Affiliate thereof, or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  



  

Section 3.08   _Fair Value_. Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and
the Company respectively agree that the Merger Consideration represents not
less than the fair value of the Shares for the purposes of Section 238(8) of
the CICL.

a corporation or other legal entity, duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept)

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) has full corporate or similar power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct
its business as presently conducted, except where any failure to have
such power or authority would not, individually or in the aggregate,

duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in

(a)  Except for this Agreement, as of the date hereof, none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by: (i) any
Contract that would be required to be filed by the Company as a
"material contract" pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act; (ii) any Contract containing covenants binding upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that materially restricts the ability of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any business or in any
geographic area that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, as of the date hereof; (iii) any Contract with respect to a

l Contract_."

  



  

(b)  Each of the Material Contracts is valid and binding on the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, each other party thereto and is in full force and effect, except
for such failures to be valid and binding or to be in full force and effect
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no default under any

promptly as practicable after the date hereof, (i) the Company (with Parent's
reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC preliminary proxy
materials which shall constitute the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (ii)
Parent (with the Company's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with
the SEC a Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under
the Securities Act of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
First Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to (A) cause the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to comply with the applicable rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC, (B) have the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing
(including by responding to comments from the SEC), and, prior to the
effective date of the Registration Statement, take all action reasonably
required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection
with the issuance of shares Parent Common Stock in connection with the First
Merger and (C) keep the Registration Statement effective through the Closing
Date in order to permit the consummation of the First Merger. No filing of,
or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement will be made by
Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be made by the Company, in each case without
providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
(which comments shall be considered by the applicable party in good faith)
thereon if reasonably practicable. Each of Parent and the Company shall
furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the other in
connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution
of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. As promptly
as practicable after the Registration Statement shall have become effective,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders. If, at any time prior
to the Company Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to either the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so
that either such document does not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
prepared, filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated
to the Company Shareholders. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall
notify the other promptly of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the
qualification of the shares Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the First Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt
of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by
the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement or for additional
information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence
between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Mergers.

constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Shareholders Meeting.

Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent, provided that all such material
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person.

  



  

(b)  Except (x) as expressly permitted by _Section 6.07(c)_ and
(y) as may relate to any Person, group of Persons or other group that
includes any Person or group of Persons from whom the Company has received
during the Go-Shop Period a _bona fide _ written Takeover Proposal that
Company Special Committee determines after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel prior to the Go-Shop Period End Date
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal
(any such Person, group of Persons or other group, an " _Excluded Party_ "),
the Company agrees that (i) at 12:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on the day that
follows the end of the Go-Shop Period (the " _Go-Shop Period End Date_
"), the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing

into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring, directly or
indirectly, the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (IV) publicly propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing; _provided_ , that following the Go-Shop Period End Date, the
Company may continue to engage in the activities described in _Section
6.07(b)_ with respect to any Excluded Party, including with respect to any
amended proposal submitted by any Excluded Party following the Go-Shop Period
End Date, and the restrictions in _Section 6.07(b)_  (other than in clause
(C)(III), which shall remain subject to _Section 6.07(e)_ ) shall not apply
with respect thereto and such acts shall not constitute a breach of _Section
6.07(b)_.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time following the Go-Shop Period
End Date and prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, in response to a
_bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a material
breach of _Section 6.07(b)_ , if the Company Special Committee determines
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such
Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, the Company may (and may authorize and permit its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to), subject to compliance with _Section
6.07(f)_ , (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement not less restrictive
with respect to terms regarding confidentiality with respect to the Person
making such Takeover Proposal than those set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent; _pro vided_ that all such material
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person, and (ii) participate in discussions and negotiations with the Person
making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal, if and only to the extent that in connection with the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Company Special Committee determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of directors under the Laws of the Cayman Islands. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this _Section 6.07_ to the contrary, following the Go-
Shop Period, any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party for all
purposes under this Agreement (A) if the Takeover Proposal made by such
Excluded Party is determined by the Company Special Committee that it could
not reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and such Excluded
Party does not deliver to the Company Special Committee (or its
Representatives) within three (3) Business Days of such determination by the
Company Special Committee an updated or revised Takeover Proposal that the
Company Special Committee determines is or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, following such third (3rd) Business Day or (B)
at such time as the Takeover Proposal made by such Excluded Party is
withdrawn, terminates or expires by its terms.

  



  

(d)  Subject to _Section 6.07(e)_ , the Company Special
Committee shall not (i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw or withhold (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent), the Company Recommendation, (B) recommend or endorse the
approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly propose to
recommend, endorse, approve or adopt, any Takeover Proposal or (C) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal
Documentation (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as
an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "; it being understood that any "stop,
look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change) or (ii) cause to permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any Takeover Proposal Documentation.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Required Vote, the Company Special Committee may, if, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, it determines
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of directors under the Laws of the Cayman Islands, (x) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response of a Change in Circumstance, (y) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or (z) cause
or permit the Company to terminate this Agreement in order to enter into any
Takeover Proposal Documentation regarding a Superior Proposal, if and only
if:

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

 (i) the Company shall have given Parent notice at least three (3) Business Days prior to making any such Adverse Recommendation Change or causing or permitting the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (z) above, which notice shall include (A) the most current version of any proposed written agreement, or if there is no such proposed written agreement, a reasonable description of the material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Special Committee (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional two (2) Business Day period prior to taking any specified action) or (B) the material event or development or material change in circumstance constituting such Change in Circumstance;

  



  

 (ii) the Company has and has caused its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to make themselves available to negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives during the period referred to in clause (i) above in order to permit Parent to propose one or more amendments to this Agreement that would result in such Takeover Proposal ceasing to constitute a Superior Proposal or such other matter no longer constituting a Change in Circumstance; and

  



  

 (iii) after considering any proposed binding offers to amend this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent during the period referred to in clause (i) above, if any, the Company Special Committee shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that the failure to make the Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Superior Proposal or Change in Circumstance or cause or permit the Company to terminate this Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors under the Laws of the Cayman Islands.

  



  

(f)  In addition to the obligations of the Company set
forth in _Section 6.07(a)_ , _Section 6.07(b)_ and _Section 6.07(c)_ , the
Company shall (i) as promptly as practicable advise Parent of any Takeover
Proposal received by the Company following the Go-Shop Period End Date, the
material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal and the identity
of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal and (ii) subject to the
fiduciary duties of directors under the Laws of the Cayman Islands, keep
Parent reasonably informed of any material developments with respect to any
such Takeover Proposal described in clause (i) above (including any material
changes thereto).

  



  

(g)  Nothing contained in this _Section 6.07_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to
its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(c) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its
shareholders if the Company Special Committee determines (after consultation
with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of directors under the Laws of the Cayman Islands, it
being understood, however, that this clause (ii) shall not be deemed to
permit the Company Special Committee to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
or take any of the actions referred to in clause (ii) of _Section 6.07(d)_
except, in each case, to the extent permitted by _Section 6.07(e)_.

the transactions contemplated hereby. Thereafter, the Company and Parent
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements (including scheduling of a press conference or
conference call with investors or analysts) with respect to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of
the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may,
without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or
make such public statement (a) as may be required by Law or Order, the
applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange or any listing agreement with
the New York Stock Exchange, (b) to enforce its rights and remedies under
this Agreement or (c) as contemplated by _Section 6.07(e)_.

and its Subsidiaries who is an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary at
the Closing Date (each such employee, a " _Company Emp loyee_"), (i) base
salary and target annual cash incentive bonus opportunities and target long-
term incentive opportunities that are, in each case, no less than the base
salary and target annual cash incentive bonus opportunities and target long-
term incentive opportunities (excluding any equity or equity-based
compensation opportunities but subject to _Section 6.01_ ) applicable to each
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee
benefits (excluding severance, nonqualified deferred compensation and
qualified retirement plans) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate,
than those employee benefits (excluding severance, nonqualified deferred
compensation and qualified retirement plans) provided to Company Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(b)  Parent shall provide each Company Employee who incurs a
termination of employment other than for "cause" or resigns with  "good
reason" or is not offered "comparable employment" during the twelve (12) month
period following the Closing Date with severance payments and severance
benefits, subject to such Company Employee's execution and non-revocation of
a waiver and general release of claims in favor of Parent and its Affiliates
(in the form reasonably acceptable to Parent) that becomes effective no later
than the sixtieth (60th) day following such termination, that are no less
favorable than the severance payments and severance benefits to which such
employees would have been entitled with respect to such termination or
resignation under the Fidelity and Guaranty Life 2015 Severance Plan or, if
applicable, employment agreement, in each case, as in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(c)  Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company or the
Final Surviving Company, as applicable, or Parent's or the Surviving
Company's or the Final Surviving Company's Subsidiaries, as applicable, to
use commercially reasonable efforts to give Company Employees full credit for
Company Employees' service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of benefits
(including, for purposes of vacation and severance), but not for purposes of
benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan or for purposes of any
benefit plan that provides retiree health or welfare benefits or any equity or
equity-based compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement, under any
benefit plans made generally available to officers or employees or any class
or level of officers or employees maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company
or the Final Surviving Company, as applicable, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in which a Company Employee participates to the same extent
recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date under a
comparable Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

(d)  Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company or the
Final Surviving Company, as applicable, or Parent's or the Surviving
Company's or the Final Surviving Company's Subsidiaries, as applicable, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations otherwise applicable to Company Employees and their eligible
dependents under any plan of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent that provides
health benefits in which Company Employees may be eligible to
participate following the Closing Date, other than any limitations that were
in effect with respect to such employees as of the Closing Date under the
analogous Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-
pocket maximums incurred by the Company Employees and their eligible
dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior
to the Closing Date during the portion of the calendar year prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket
maximums under health plans of Parent, the Surviving Company or the Final
Surviving Company, as applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
which they are eligible to participate after the Closing Date in the same plan
year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were
incurred and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company
Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing Date, in
each case to the extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Benefit
Plan prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(e)  The Company shall take all actions, including through
resolutions of the board of directors (or a duly constituted and
authorized committee thereof or other appropriate governing body) of the
Company or it applicable Subsidiary, that may be necessary or appropriate to
cause any Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended
to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (including any plan intended to
qualify under 401(k) of the Code) (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to
terminate effective on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, with such termination being contingent on the Closing. Such resolutions
shall be subject to Parent's reasonable prior review and approval. As of the
Closing Date, Parent shall offer participation in Parent's tax-qualified
defined contribution plan (" _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), effective as of the
Closing Date, to each person who was an active participant in the Company
401(k) Plan as of the date of its termination. If elected by a Company
Employee in accordance with applicable Law, Parent shall cause the Parent
401(k) Plan to, following the Closing Date, accept a "direct rollover" to
such Parent 401(k) Plan of the account balances (including promissory
notes evidencing outstanding participant loans) of such Company Employee.

(f)  This _Section 6.09_ shall be binding upon and shall inure
solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement and

any other related Contract, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement; (ii) except as expressly provided by

its Subsidiaries, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, modify or

intended to or shall confer upon any current or former employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or any other person any right to employment or continued
employment or service for any period of time by reason of this Agreement or
any other related agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition
of employment.

those persons who are currently covered by the Company's directors' and
officers', fiduciary and employment practices liability insurance policies
(copies of which have been made available or delivered to Parent) with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as those
of such current insurance coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
will Parent, the Surviving Company or the Final Surviving Company be required
to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Pre mium_"),
which Maximum Premium is set forth in Section 6.10(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that, if the annual premiums

obligated to obtain policies with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount; and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that at
the Company's option in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company
may purchase, prior to the First Effective Time, six (6) year "tail"

to the coverage described above, provided that the Company does not pay more
than the aggregate Maximum Premium.

  



  

(c)  Parent and the Company agree that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from, and advancement of expenses with respect
to, liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the First
Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in favor

Subsidiaries as provided in their respective memorandum and articles of
association (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification
or other agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the
date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving Company or the Final

and effect in accordance with their terms. Further, the memorandum and

former or present directors and officers than are presently set forth in the
Company Memorandum, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the First Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
such individuals, except as amendments may be required by the CICL during
such period.

this _Section 6.10_.

  



  

(f)  The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section
6.10_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitute for, any rights such
Indemnified Parties may have under the memorandum and articles of association
(or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws, and Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Company or the Final Surviving Company, as

Section 9.08   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY FOR ANY DISPUTE BASED
UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION
OR VALIDITY HEREOF OR ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
OF THE PARTIES CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NEITHER THE OTHER PARTIES

Section 9.09   _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties hereto would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise
breached and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy for any such failure to perform or breach. It is accordingly
agreed that, without posting a bond or other undertaking, the parties
hereto shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Courts, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event
that any such action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, no party hereto will allege, and each party hereto hereby waives
the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law.
The parties hereto further agree that (a) by seeking any remedy provided for
in this _Section 9.09_ , a party hereto shall not in any respect waive its
right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such party
hereto under this Agreement and (b) nothing contained in this _Section 9.09_
shall require any party hereto to institute any action for (or limit
such party's right to institute any action for) specific performance under
this _Section 9.09_ before exercising any other right under this Agreement.
If, prior to the Outside Termination Date, any party hereto brings any Action
in accordance with this Agreement to enforce specifically the performance of
the terms and provisions hereof against any other party, the Outside
Termination Date shall be automatically extended (i) for the period during
which such Action is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (ii) by such
other time period established by the court presiding over such action on good
cause shown, as the case may be.

Section 9.10   _E_ _xclusions from Representations and Warranties_.
Except as expressly set forth in _Section 4.11(b)_ , notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other agreement, document
or instrument delivered or to be delivered in connection herewith, each of
Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II acknowledges and agrees that the
Company and its Subsidiaries make no representations or warranties with
respect to, and nothing contained in this Agreement or in any other
agreement, document or instrument to be delivered in connection herewith is
intended or shall be construed to be a representation or warranty, express or
implied, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, for any purposes of this
Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument to be delivered in
connection herewith or therewith, in respect of (a) the adequacy or
sufficiency of reserves, (b) the effect of the adequacy or sufficiency of
reserves on any line item, asset, liability or equity amount on any financial
or other document, (c) whether or not reserves were determined in accordance
with any actuarial, statutory, regulatory or other standard or (d) the
collectability of any amounts under any Reinsurance Contract.
Furthermore, each of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II acknowledges,
understands and agrees that no fact, condition, development or issue relating
to the adequacy or sufficiency of reserves may be used, directly or
indirectly, to demonstrate or support the breach or violation of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of or by the Company or its
Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement or any other agreement, document or
instrument delivered or to be delivered in connection herewith.

  



  

Section 9.11   _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by the Delaware Courts or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.12   _Parent Undertaking_. Parent hereby fully, irrevocably
and unconditionally guarantees the full, complete and timely performance of
all agreements, covenants and obligations of its Subsidiaries, when
performance of the same shall be required in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.
