iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 12, 2003 (the
"Agreement"), is among Synopsys, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
Neon Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser"), and Numerical Technologies, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").



WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company, and Parent (in
its capacity as sole stockholder of Purchaser), have each determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger
(as defined in Section 2.1), are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, their respective stockholders;



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted resolutions
approving the acquisition of the Company by Parent, the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and by
the Stockholder Tender Agreement (as defined below), and recommending that the
Companys stockholders approve the agreement of merger (as such term is used
in Section 251 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL")) contained in this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and tender their shares of Company Common Stock (as defined below) in the
Offer (as defined below);



WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement, and as a condition to their doing so, Parent is simultaneously
entering into a stockholder tender agreement (the "Stockholder Tender
Agreement") with the Companys directors and executive officers (and certain
related persons and entities) owning shares of Company Common Stock, pursuant
to which (i) such stockholders are, among other things, agreeing to tender,
and not withdraw, all of such stockholders shares of Company Common Stock in
the Offer upon the terms and conditions specified therein, and (ii) certain of
such stockholders are agreeing to certain restrictive covenants.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the Company, Parent and Purchaser hereby agree as
follows:



ARTICLE I



THE OFFER



1.1. _The Offer_. (a) (i) Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Article IX and that none of the events set
forth in paragraph (2) of Exhibit A hereto shall have occurred and be
continuing and the Company shall have filed, or shall be prepared to file upon
commencement of the Offer, the Schedule 14D-9 (as defined below) as
contemplated by Section 1.2(b) hereof, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than
eight (8) Business Days following the public announcement of the terms of this
Agreement)   commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Exchange Act")) an offer to purchase all outstanding shares (individually, a
"Share" and collectively, the "Shares") of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), at a price (such price, or
any other price as may be paid in the Offer, the "Offer Price") of $7.00 per
Share, net to the seller in cash (the "Offer"). The obligations of Purchaser
to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment and to pay for
any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to only those
conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the "Offer Conditions"). The initial
expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth Business Day following
the commencement of the Offer. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive
any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the
prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the
Offer Price or change the form of the consideration payable in the Offer, (B)
decrease the number of Shares sought pursuant to the Offer, (C) waive the
Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in Exhibit A) or impose additional
conditions to the Offer or (D) make any other change in the terms or
conditions of the Offer which is adverse to the holders of Shares.



(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the
satisfaction or waiver by Parent and Purchaser of the Offer Conditions as of
any scheduled expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay for Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after
such scheduled expiration. Purchaser shall extend the Offer on one or more
occasions for periods of up to 20 Business Days per extension if, at any
scheduled expiration of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions have not been
satisfied or waived; _provided_ , that if all Offer Conditions other than the
Minimum Tender Condition are satisfied or waived as of any scheduled
expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be obligated to (but shall be
entitled) to extend the Offer unless required by applicable law; and,
_provided_ , _further_ , that if at any scheduled expiration of the Offer (x)
the Offer Condition in paragraph 2(a) or 2(c) of Exhibit A has not been
satisfied or (y) the Offer Condition in paragraph 2(d) of Exhibit A has not
been satisfied and, in the case of clause (y), the breach or failure to
perform or comply that has caused such non-satisfaction is not capable of
being cured (it being understood that willful failure to comply with Section
7.3 is not capable of being cured) or, if capable of being cured, has not been
cured within fifteen days after receipt by the Company of notice of such
breach or failure, then Purchaser shall not be obligated (but shall be
entitled) to extend the Offer. In addition, Purchaser may (without the consent
of the Company) (A) extend the Offer for any period required by
any regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer, or (B)
elect to provide a subsequent offering period for the Offer in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. In addition, the Offer Price may be
increased and the Offer may be extended to the extent required by law in
connection with such increase in each case without the consent of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser will not extend the Offer beyond
August 31, 2003 without the Companys consent and Purchaser will not be
required to extend the Offer beyond that date.

 

2 (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall
file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") with
respect to the Offer which shall contain the offer to purchase and related
letter of transmittal and other ancillary Offer documents and instruments
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Company and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
prior to their filing with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the
Company with, and to consult with the Company regarding, any comments that may
be received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt thereof. Parent, Purchaser and the Company each agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect and Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the
extent required by applicable law.



(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.



1.2. _Company Actions_. (a) The Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that (i) the making of any
offer and proposal and the taking of any other action by Parent or Purchaser
in connection with this Agreement and the Stockholder Tender Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been consented to by the
Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the terms and provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into between the Company and Parent
dated December 6, 2002 (the "Confidentiality Agreement") and the Non-
Solicitation Agreement entered into between the Company and Parent dated
December 20, 2002 (the "Non-Solicitation Agreement"), (ii) its Board of
Directors (at a meeting or meetings duly called and held) has (A) determined
that the Offer and the Merger (as hereinafter defined) are advisable and fair
to and in the best interests of, the stockholders of the Company, (B) approved
and adopted the agreement of merger (as such term is used in Section 251 of
the DGCL) contained in this Agreement, (C) resolved to recommend acceptance
of the Offer and approval and adoption of the agreement of merger contained in
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, (D) irrevocably taken all
necessary steps to approve Parent and Purchaser becoming "interested
stockholders" within the meaning of Section 203 of the DGCL and causing said
Section 203 to be inapplicable to Parent and Purchaser and to the Merger, the
Stockholder Tender Agreement and the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the
Offer and the Stockholder Tender Agreement, and (E) irrevocably resolved to
elect, to the extent of the Boards power and authority and to the extent
permitted by law, not to be subject to any other "moratorium", "control share
acquisition", "business combination", "fair price" or other form of anti-
takeover laws and regulations (collectively, "Takeover Laws") of any
jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to this Agreement or the
Stockholder Tender Agreement, and (iii) Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
(the "Company Financial Advisor"), the Companys independent financial
advisor, has advised the Companys Board of Directors that, in its opinion,
the consideration to be paid in the Offer and the Merger to the Companys
stockholders is fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.

 

3 (b) Upon commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing (subject
to Section 7.3(b)) the recommendations of its Board of Directors described in
Section 1.2(a) and hereby consents to the inclusion of such recommendations in
the Offer Documents and to the inclusion of a copy of the Schedule 14D-9 with
the Offer Documents mailed or furnished to the Companys
stockholders. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its filing
with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and Purchaser with, and to
consult with Parent and Purchaser regarding, any comments that may be
received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
upon receipt thereof. Parent, Purchaser and the Company each agrees promptly
to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if
and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required
by applicable law.



1.3. _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the Company
shall promptly furnish Parent and Purchaser with mailing labels, security
position listings and any available listing or computer file containing the
names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of the latest
practicable date and shall furnish Parent and Purchaser with such information
and assistance (including periodic updates of such information) as Parent or
Purchaser or their agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to
the record and beneficial holders of the Shares.



1.4. _Directors_. (a) Promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser pursuant
to the Offer or otherwise of such number of Shares as represents at least a
majority of the outstanding Shares, and from time to time thereafter,
Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up
to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as will
give Purchaser representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal
to the product of the number of directors on the Board of Directors of the
Company and the percentage that such number of Shares so purchased bears to
the number of Shares outstanding, and the Company shall, upon request by
Purchaser, promptly increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company
or use its best efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors
as is necessary to provide Purchaser with such level of representation and
shall cause Purchasers designees to be so elected. The Company will also use
its best efforts to cause Persons designated by Purchaser to constitute
(subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law or NASD (as defined
below) rule) the same percentage as is on the entire Board of Directors of the
Company to be on (i) each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
and (ii) each Board of Directors and each committee thereof of each subsidiary
of the Company. The Companys obligations to appoint designees to its Board
of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. At the
request of Purchaser, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect
any such election or appointment of Purchasers designees, including mailing
to its stockholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder which, unless Purchaser otherwise
elects, shall be so mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and
Purchaser will supply to the Company all information with respect to
themselves and their respective officers, directors and affiliates required by
such Section and Rule.

 

4 (b) Following the election or appointment of Purchasers designees pursuant
to Section 1.4(a) and prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.2),
and so long as there shall be at least one Continuing Director (as defined
below), any amendment or termination of this Agreement requiring action
by the Board of Directors of the Company, any extension of time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser
under this Agreement and any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions under this Agreement for the benefit of the Company or any
exercise of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement will require
the concurrence of a majority of the directors of the Company then in office
who are directors of the Company on the date hereof or their successors
designated by the Continuing Directors then in office (the "Continuing
Directors").



ARTICLE II



THE MERGER



2.1. _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined below), upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with
the DGCL, Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger").
Following the Merger, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue its existence under the
DGCL, and the separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease.



2.2. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger complying with Section 251 of the DGCL with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Certificate of Merger")
on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 2.3). The Merger shall become
effective upon such filing or at such time thereafter as the parties shall
agree and as shall be provided in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective
Time").



2.3. _Closing of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place at a time and on a date (the "Closing Date") to be specified
by Parent, which shall be no later than the fifth Business Day (as defined in
Section 10.11) after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII, at the offices of Parent (or such other location to be
specified by Parent), unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by
the parties hereto.



2.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the properties, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
obligations and duties of the Company and Purchaser shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

5 2.5. _Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws_. The certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and
restated as of the Effective Time to contain the text of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except as necessary to reflect the fact that the name of the
Surviving Corporation, from and after the Effective Time, shall continue to be
"Numerical Technologies, Inc." and as so amended and restated, such
certificate of incorporation shall (as amended from time to time) be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. The by-laws of
Purchaser in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-
laws of the Surviving Corporation and shall be amended in due course to
reflect the fact that the name of the Surviving Corporation, from and after
the Effective Time, shall be "Numerical Technologies, Inc."



2.6. _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of Purchaser
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.



2.7. _Stockholders  Meeting_. Unless the Merger is consummated in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section 2.8, and
subject to applicable law, the Company, acting through its Board of Directors,
shall, in accordance with applicable law, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a special meeting (the "Special Meeting") of its stockholders as soon
as practicable following the consummation of the Offer for the purpose of
adopting the agreement of merger (within the meaning of Section 251 of the
DGCL) set forth in this Agreement and include in the Proxy Statement (as
defined in Section 4.7) the recommendation of its Board of Directors that
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of the agreement of
merger set forth in this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser each agree that, at
the Special Meeting, all of the Shares acquired pursuant to the Offer, the
Stockholder Tender Agreement or otherwise by Parent or Purchaser or any of
their subsidiaries will be voted in favor of the Merger.



2.8. _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. If Purchaser, or any
other direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent, shall hold at least 90 percent
of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company, each
of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective, as soon as practicable after
the consummation of the Offer, without a meeting of stockholders of the
Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 

6 ARTICLE III



CONVERSION OF SECURITIES



3.1. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties hereto or
any holder of any securities or interests of or in the Company or Purchaser:



(a) _Conversion of Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of
Purchaser outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into a share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is owned by the Company or Parent or any of their
respective wholly-owned subsidiaries shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.1(b)) shall be
converted into the right to receive in cash an amount per share (subject to
any applicable withholding tax specified in Section 3.6) equal to the Offer
Price, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), upon the surrender of
the certificate representing such Shares as provided in Section 3.3. At
the Effective Time all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.



3.2. _Stock Options and Other Stock Plans_. (a) As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company (or,
if appropriate, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company administering the Companys 1997 Stock
Plan, 2000 Stock Plan, 2001 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, Cadabra Design
Libraries Inc. Stock Option Plan and Cadabra Design Libraries Inc. U.S. Stock
Option Plan (collectively, the "Company Option Plans")) shall take such
action as may be required or desirable to effect the following provisions of
this Section 3.2(a), including taking such action as is necessary to avoid the
acceleration of the vesting of options under the Cadabra Designs Libraries
Inc. Stock Option Plan. Except as may otherwise be provided in any agreement
on terms specified in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
effective as of the Effective Time (i) each then outstanding option
to purchase Shares (each a "Company Stock Option") granted pursuant to the
Company Option Plans or otherwise granted by the Company to any current or
former employee or director of, or consultant to, the Company or any of
its subsidiaries shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into an
option (an "Assumed Stock Option") to purchase a number of shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (including the associated rights
to purchase shares of Series A Participating Preferred Stock)(the "Parent
Common Stock") (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to (x) the
number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Option Conversion Ratio and (ii) the
per share exercise price for shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of each such Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to (1) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option
was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (2) the
Option Conversion Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any
Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of
its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the conversion formula shall
be adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code by
rounding up the resulting exercise price to the nearest whole cent 

 

7  and by rounding down the number of shares subject to the assumed option to
the nearest whole number. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Assumed
Stock Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including
expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were applicable to the
corresponding Company Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that the Parent Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall
succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board of Directors
or any committee thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Option
Conversion Ratio" means a fraction, the numerator of which is the Offer Price
and the denominator of which is the average for the five trading-day period
ending with the trading-day immediately preceding the date on which the
Effective Time occurs of the average of the high and low prices for trades in
Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market Trading System, as reported
by the Wall Street Journal (or, if not so reported, as reported by another
reputable source selected by Parent), appropriately adjusted for any stock
splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar events.



(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent
shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock upon the exercise of the
Assumed Stock Options. Parent shall use its best efforts to prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate form
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Stock
Options and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements covering such Assumed Stock Options (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such Assumed Stock Options remain outstanding.



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary or
appropriate action (including amending any of the Company Option Plans and
related award agreements or making adjustments as permitted thereby) to
preclude the grant of any additional options or other awards of any type under
any of the Company Option Plans or otherwise from and after the Effective
Time.



(d) The Company shall take such action as is necessary to (i) cause the
exercise (as of a date that is no later than three Business Days prior to the
date in which occurs the Effective Time) of each outstanding purchase right
under the Companys 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company Stock
Purchase Plan") and (ii) provide that no further purchase period shall
commence under such plan; _provided_ , that such exercise and cessation of
further purchase periods shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger. On such new exercise date, the Company shall apply the funds credited
as of such date under the applicable Company Stock Purchase Plan within each
participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock
Purchase Plan. At the Effective Time, a holder of such Shares received under
the Company Stock Purchase Plans shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of such holder, be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax as specified in
Section 3.6 hereof), upon the surrender of the certificate representing such
Shares as provided in Section 3.3. Immediately prior to and effective as of
the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company
shall terminate the Company Stock Purchase Plan.

 

8 3.3. _Payment for Shares_. (a) From time to time after the Effective
Time, Parent will cause Purchaser to make available to a bank or trust company
designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Paying Agent") sufficient funds to make the payments due pursuant to this
Section 3.3 on a timely basis to holders of Shares that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amounts being
hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments provided for in the
preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.



(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record
holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or
certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented Shares (other than Shares owned by Parent or Purchaser or
any of their respective subsidiaries and Dissenting Shares), a form of letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificate and receiving payment therefor. Following
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid in
exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding
tax as specified in Section 3.6) equal to the product of the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and
such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. If payment
is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment pay any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3, each Certificate shall
represent for all purposes (subject to Section 3.8) solely the right to
receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in cash
multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate, without any
interest thereon.



(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly
represented thereby.



(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the
Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be repaid to Parent or
otherwise on the instruction of Parent. Any former stockholders of the Company
who have not complied 

 

9  with this Article III prior to the end of such six-month period shall
thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws) but only as general creditors thereof for payment of
their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of
Shares for any monies delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to two
years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date as shall be immediately
prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar law) unclaimed funds payable with
respect to such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto.



3.4. _No Further Ownership Rights_. All cash issued upon conversion of
the Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to
have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares.



3.5. _Investment of the Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest
the Payment Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis. Any interest and
other income resulting from any such investment shall promptly be paid to
Parent.



3.6. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to holders of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
or any provision of a Tax Law (as the term "Tax" is defined in Section 4.16(k)
hereof). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the Offer as having been paid
to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.



3.7. _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the
Company. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall, subject to Section 3.3(d), be
exchanged for the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly
represented thereby, subject to applicable law in the case of Dissenting
Shares.



3.8. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders exercising appraisal
rights available under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the
DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holders Shares
shall thereupon 

 

10  be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as
of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.
The Company shall give Parent and Purchaser (a) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and (b) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of
capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or settle any demands or approve
any withdrawal of any such demands.

conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and (in those jurisdictions

outstanding options, warrants, calls, preemptive rights, subscriptions or
other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character
(whether or not conditional) relating to the issued or unissued capital stock

irrevocable proxies with respect to such capital stock. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Lien" means, with respect to any asset (including, without
limitation, any security) any mortgage, lien, pledge, charge, security
interest or encumbrance of any kind in respect of such asset other than (i)
the lien of current taxes not yet due and payable and (ii) liens and
encumbrances that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and which do
not, individually or in the aggregate, materially detract from the value of

to cause with respect to any Company Stock Options, (i) the acceleration of
vesting provisions of or (ii) the termination of any rights by the Company to
repurchase any outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or option to buy
Company Common Stock, except, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), as

DGCL and causing said Section 203 to be inapplicable to Parent and Purchaser
and to the Merger, the Stockholder Tender Agreement and the acquisition of
Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Stockholder Tender Agreement. No
other corporate proceedings on the part of the 

 

13  Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger and
the agreement of merger (within the meaning of Section 251 of the DGCL
contained within this Agreement), the approval and adoption of the agreement
of merger contained in this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Company Common Stock prior to consummation of the Merger (unless
the Merger is consummated pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL)). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles.



(b) Unless the Merger is consummated pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL as
contemplated by Section 2.8, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Special
Meeting is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of
capital stock of the Company necessary to adopt the agreement of merger
contained within this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger. Purchaser will have full voting power with
respect to any Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer or the Stockholder
Tender Agreement.

filed all required forms, reports and documents with the SEC since January 1,
2000, each of which has complied in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")
or the Exchange Act, each as in effect on the dates such forms, reports and
documents were filed. No subsidiary of the Company has filed, or is required
to file, any form, report or other document with the SEC. The Company has

any amendments thereto) (i) its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for each of the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001; (ii) all definitive proxy

referred to herein as the "Company SEC Reports"). None of such forms, reports
or documents, including, without limitation, any financial statements,
exhibits or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein,
contained, when filed, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



(b) The audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements of the
Company included (or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC Reports
complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto and fairly present, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis ("GAAP") (except
as specifically indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial

position for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments). The Company

and revenues for the quarter ending December 31, 2002, which information is
accurate in all material respects, and (y) information with respect to the
Companys actual financial results for the 2002 fiscal year and the fourth
quarter, and the actual results will not materially differ from the
information so provided.



4.5. _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether
accrued, contingent or otherwise, and whether or not required to be recorded
or reflected on a balance sheet under GAAP, except (i) liabilities or
obligations reflected in the financial statements in the Company SEC Reports
filed prior to the date hereof, including liabilities or obligations
adequately provided for or fully disclosed in the Companys unaudited balance

Balance Sheet"), (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred since September 30,
2002 and prior to the date hereof in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, and since September 30, 2002 which have not

amounts consistent with those set forth on Section 4.5 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule) incurred or to be incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the liabilities described in
Section 4.23).



4.6. _Absence of Changes_. Except as and to the extent publicly
disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since

and its subsidiaries have conducted their business in the ordinary course of

directly, contingently or otherwise) by the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company for the obligations of any other person (other than any wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company);

 

15 (e) any creation or assumption by the Company or any subsidiary of
the Company of any Lien on any material asset of the Company or any

(b) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the
respective 

 

17  articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing

Material Adverse Effect on the Company.



4.10. _Real Property_. (a) Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries owns any real property.



(b) Section 4.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all leases,
subleases and other agreements (the "Real Property Leases") under which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries uses, occupies or sublets or has the right
to use, occupy or sublet now or in the future, any real property. The Company
has heretofore delivered or made available to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of all Real Property Leases (and all modifications,
amendments and supplements thereto and all side letters to which the Company
or any of its subsidiaries is a party affecting the obligations of any party
thereunder). Each Real Property Lease constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of the Company or its subsidiaries, enforceable in
accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights or by general equity principles), and is in full force and
effect. All rent and other sums and charges payable by the Company and

part of the Company or any such subsidiary of the Company or, to the
Companys knowledge, the landlord or the sublessee, as the case may be, exists

18  any Real Property Lease. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has a good

and clear of all Liens, except (i) Liens for Taxes and general and special
assessments not in default and payable without penalty and material interest;
(ii) Liens on the landlords interest in the facility being leased which are
not currently interfering with the Companys or any of its subsidiaries use
and enjoyment of such real property; and (iii) other liens, mortgages,

with the Companys or any of its subsidiaries use and enjoyment of such real
property or materially detract from or diminish the value thereof.



(c) No party to any Real Property Lease has given notice to the Company or
any of its subsidiaries of or made a claim against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to the Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to any
material breach or default thereunder and the Company has no knowledge of any
such claim.



4.11. _Litigation_. (a) Except to the extent set forth in Section
4.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule as of the date hereof, there is no
suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the Companys
knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets.



(b) There is no suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation pending or,
to the Companys knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets that, if
decided adversely to the Company would have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. None of the Company or its
subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree.



4.12. _Company Permits; Compliance with Applicable Laws_. The Company
and its subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders
and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of

would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. The Company and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the
terms of the Company Permits, except where the failure to so comply would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries are not being
conducted in violation of any Law applicable to the Company or its
subsidiaries, except for violations which would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the
Companys knowledge, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries is pending or threatened, nor,
to the Companys knowledge, has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention
to conduct the same. 



4.13. _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_. (a) Section 4.13(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule lists each material employment, consulting,

any current or former employee, consultant or director of any entity with
respect to which the Company or its subsidiaries is a successor or with

current plan or commitment to create any additional Company Benefit Plan or
modify or change any existing Company Benefit Plan that would materially
increase the compensation or benefits provided to any employee or
former employee, consultant or director of the Company or any subsidiary of
the Company, other than to comply with changes in the laws or regulations
applicable thereto. Since the Audit Date there has been no material change,
amendment, modification to, or adoption of, any Company Benefit Plan other
than to comply with changes in the laws or regulations applicable thereto.

provisions of the Code or any foreign law or regulation relating to employee
benefit plans (including, without limitation, Section 

 

20  406, 409, 502(i), 502(l), 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA, or Section 4971, 4975 or
4976 of the Code), or under any agreement, instrument, statute, rule or legal
requirement pursuant to or under which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or any Company Benefit Plan has agreed to indemnify or is required to
indemnify any person against liability incurred under, or for a violation or
failure to satisfy the requirements of, any such legal requirement, and to
the knowledge of the Company, no event, transaction or condition has occurred,
exists or is expected to occur which could result in any such material
liability to the Company, any of its subsidiaries or, after the Closing,
to Parent.



(d) The Company and each of its subsidiaries has complied in all material
respects with, and each such Company Benefit Plan conforms in all material
respects in operation and form to (or has remaining a period of time to
conform such plan to applicable legal requirements) all applicable legal
requirements, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code and all
applicable U.S. and non-U.S. securities laws and regulations except as would
not reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.



(e) With respect to each "employee pension benefit plan" (within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA) as to which either the Company or any subsidiary of
the Company may incur any liability under, or which is subject to, Section 302

Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or by any other person, so as to

person were to withdraw from such plan, neither the Company nor any subsidiary
of the Company would incur, directly or indirectly, any material liability
under Title IV of ERISA;

 

21 (vii) no "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) has
occurred with respect to any such plan, nor has notice of any such event or
similar notice to any foreign Regulatory Agency been required to be filed for
any Company Benefit Plan within the past 12 months nor will any such notice
be required to be filed as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

their termination of employment or service, other than as required under
Section 4980B of the Code or similar laws. There has been no communication to
any employee, consultant or director of the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company that would reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee any such

entitle any current or former employee, consultant or director of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or any group of such employees, consultants or
directors to any material payment; (ii) materially increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due to any such employee, consultant or director;
(iii) accelerate the vesting, funding or time of payment of any compensation,

other provision of the Code or any similar foreign law or regulation.

recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the actuarially determined
present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(16) of ERISA or, with respect to any foreign plan, as determined

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



7.1. _Proxy Statement_. Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance
with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section 2.8, the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC, subject to the prior review and approval of
Parent and Purchaser (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), as
soon as practicable after the consummation of the Offer, a preliminary Proxy
Statement (the "Preliminary Proxy Statement") relating to the Merger as
required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The
Company shall obtain and furnish the information required to be included in
the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall provide Parent and Purchaser with, and
consult with Parent and Purchaser regarding, any comments that may be received
from the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, shall, subject to the prior
review and approval of Parent and Purchaser (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), respond promptly to any such comments made by the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders at the
earliest practicable date and shall use its best efforts to obtain the
necessary approval of the Merger by its stockholders.



7.2. _Commercially Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws promptly to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act and use commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all other actions consistent with this Section 7.2 necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act as soon as practicable.



(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 7.2(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, (i) use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; and (ii) keep
the other Party informed in all material respects of any material
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), or any other Governmental Entity and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. For purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust Law") means the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and all other Laws (including other national
merger control laws or foreign investment regulations) that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or 

 

42  regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.



(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 7.2(a) and 7.2(b), each of Parent and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections if
any, as may be asserted a Governmental Entity or other person with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law. In connection
with the foregoing, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective commercially
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 7.2 shall (i)
limit a Partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article IX so
long as such Party has theretofore complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 7.2 or (ii) require Parent to (A) enter into
any "hold-separate" agreement or other agreement with respect to the
disposition of any assets or businesses in order to obtain clearance from the
FTC or the DOJ or any other antitrust or competition authorities to proceed
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the
extent the assets or businesses covered by such agreement consist solely
of products and technologies of the Company as of the date this Agreement is
executed, and such assets would not be material to the operation of Parent and
its subsidiaries taken as a whole following the Merger or (B) consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby in the event that any consent, approval,
authorization or statement of non-objection obtained in connection with this
Agreement is conditioned upon the imposition of any other restrictions upon,
or the making of any material accommodation (financial or otherwise) in
respect of the conduct of the business of the Surviving Corporation or the
Parent and its subsidiaries, or results, or would result in, the abrogation or
diminishment of any authority or license granted by any Governmental Entity
to, Company or Parent, except to the extent such restriction, accommodation or
abrogation applies solely to the assets or businesses of the Company as of the
date this Agreement is executed and would not materially affect
the operations of Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole following the
Merger.



(d) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts in
consultation with Parent to obtain any consents of third parties with respect
to any Company Agreements that may be necessary or appropriate for the
purposes of the transactions contemplated hereby. 



7.3. _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) The Company agrees that (i) it will
not (and it will cause its subsidiaries and each officer, director or employee
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries not to) directly or indirectly: (A)
solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal (as
defined in Section 10.11 herein), (B) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non- 

 

43  public information with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with, or take any other action to facilitate, any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or (C) enter
into any agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) it will
not authorize or permit any investment banker, attorney or accountant, or
other advisor or representative of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i)(A), (B) or (C); _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 7.3(a) shall prohibit
the Company Board from furnishing information to, or entering into discussions
or negotiations with, any person that makes an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the extent that (1) the Company Board,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, reasonably determines in good
faith that such action may reasonably expected to be necessary for the Company
Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law, (2) the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith
that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be
consummated taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, and believes in
good faith, after consultation with an independent, nationally recognized
financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, be
reasonably likely to result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger (any
such materially more favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to herein
as a "Superior Proposal"), and (3) prior to taking such action, the Company
(x) provides three Business Day prior written notice to Parent to the effect
that it is proposing to take such action and (y) receives from such person an
executed confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form and in
any event containing terms at least as stringent as those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall notify Parent of any Acquisition
Proposal or request for nonpublic information by any person who is making, or
who has indicated that it is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal
(including, without limitation, all material terms and conditions thereof and
the identity of the person making it) as promptly as practicable (but in no
case later than 24 hours) after its receipt thereof, and shall thereafter
promptly inform Parent of any changes to the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly give Parent a copy of any information
regarding the Company delivered to such person which has not previously been
made available to Parent. Immediately after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries and affiliates,
and their respective officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other agents to, cease and terminate any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal.



(b) The Company Board shall not withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the approval
or recommendation of the Offer or the Merger as set forth in Section 1.2(a),
unless (i) the Company has complied with the terms of Section 7.3(a), (ii) the
Company Board after consultation with outside legal counsel, determines in
good faith that such action may reasonably expected to be necessary for the
Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law, (iii) the Company shall have received an
Acquisition Proposal and the Company Board reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with an independent, nationally recognized financial
advisor, that 

 

44  such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (iv) the
Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent
that it intends to take such action (such notice to be delivered not less
than three Business Days prior to the time such action is taken). Nothing
contained in this Section 7.3(b) or otherwise in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act.



7.4. _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and the Company will
consult with one another before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the Offer and the Merger, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with the NASDAQ, as determined
by Parent or the Company, as the case may be.



7.5. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) The
Parent agrees that all rights now existing to exculpation, release, and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers (the
"Indemnified Parties") of the Company as provided in its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or in any agreement listed in Section 7.5 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect indefinitely in accordance with their terms following
the Effective Time.



(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company for the benefit of those persons who are
covered by such policies at the Effective Time (or Parent may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time), to the extent that such liability
insurance can be maintained for six years at a total cost to Parent not
greater than 300 percent of the annual premium for the current
Company directors and officers liability insurance as set forth in Section
7.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , that if such insurance
cannot be so maintained or obtained at such costs, Parent shall maintain or
obtain as much of such insurance as can be so maintained or obtained for six
years at a total cost equal to 300 percent of such annual premiums of the
Company for such insurance. In addition, Parent shall allow such directors and
officers to supplement or increase the coverage under any such policies at
their own expense if such supplement or increase will not interfere with or
adversely affect Parents maintenance of the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance. 



7.6. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall, upon
obtaining knowledge of any of the following, give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent shall, upon obtaining knowledge of any of the following, give prompt
notice to the Company: (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such Party contained in this Agreement, which is
qualified as to materiality, to be untrue or inaccurate, or any representation
or warranty of such Party not so qualified, to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, at or prior to the Effective Time; (ii) any material failure
of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; (iii) 

 

45  the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which would reasonably be likely to cause any condition to the
obligations of any Party to effect the transactions contemplated hereby not
to be satisfied; (iv) in the case of the Company, any notice of, or other
communication relating to, a default or event which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would become a default, received by it or any of its
subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, under any contract or agreement material to the financial
condition, properties, businesses, results of operations of it and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a
party or is subject; (v) any material notice or other material communication
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer or the Merger; (vi)
any actions, suits, claims, investigations or other proceedings (or
communications indicating that the same may be contemplated) commenced or
threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Parent or any of
its subsidiaries, as applicable, which, if pending on the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section 4.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or which relate to the
consummation of the Merger; (vii) in the case of the Company, any notice or
other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such
third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or (viii) any event or occurrence that has
had, or would reasonably be likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 7.6 shall not cure such breach or non-compliance or limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such
notice.



7.7. _Employee Matters_. On or as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, those employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who will
continue employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation ("Continuing
Employees" ) shall be eligible to participate in those benefit plans and
programs maintained by Parent for similarly situated employees of Parent
generally (or in substantially similar programs), but explicitly excluding
individual plans, programs, arrangements or agreements, on the same
terms applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent. Each Continuing
Employee shall be given credit under the employee benefit plans, programs or
policies of Parent, for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
(but not for benefit accrual purposes excepting vacation, paid time-off and
sabbatical accrual purposes), for his or her period of service with the
Company or any of its subsidiaries credited under a similar plan prior to the
Effective Time, subject to applicable break in service rules. Each such
employee shall, with respect to any Parent plans or programs which have co-
payment, deductible or other co-insurance features, receive credit for any
amounts such individual has paid to date in the plan year of the Effective
Time under comparable plans or programs maintained by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Each Continuing Employee and
eligible dependent who, at the Effective Time, was participating in an
employee group health plan maintained by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall not be excluded from Parents employee group health plan or
limited in coverage thereunder by reason of any waiting period restriction or
pre-existing condition limitation that would not have excluded such claim
under the applicable Company Plan.



7.8. _SEC Filings_. The Company shall furnish or make available to the
Parent copies of all reports, proxy statements and prospectuses of the type
referred to in Section 4.4 which it files with the SEC on or after the date
hereof, and the Company 

 

46  represents and warrants that as of the respective dates thereof, such
reports will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements and the
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included in such reports
(including any related notes and schedules) will fairly present the financial
position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and the results of operations and cash flows or other information
included therein for the periods or as of the date then ended (subject, in
the case of the interim financial statements, to normal, recurring year-end
adjustments), in each case in accordance with past practice and GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved (except as otherwise
disclosed in the notes thereto.)



7.9. _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to Section 9.5, whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party
incurring such Expenses, except that all fees, costs and expenses of printing
and mailing the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 shall be shared equally by
the Company and Parent. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" includes all
out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all fees and expenses
of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a
Party hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a Party or on its behalf in
connection with, or related to, the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the preparation, filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy
Statement and the solicitation of stockholder approvals and all other matters
related to the transactions contemplated hereby.



7.10. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become

Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
and thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(ii) or
Section 9.4(a) (A) following a failure of the Offer Condition set forth in
paragraph 2(d) of Exhibit A to be satisfied or (B) as a result of a failure of

case of either clause (A) or clause (B), within 12 months of such termination,
(x) the Company enters into an agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or (y) any Acquisition Proposal is consummated; 



then the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of ten million U.S.

pursuant to Section 9.3(b), (II) on the first Business Day following the date

are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent or Purchaser would not have entered
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to Section 9.5(b), as applicable, and, in order to obtain

set forth in this Section 9.5, the Company shall pay any costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest from the date of termination of this Agreement on the amounts
owed at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect from time to time during
such period plus two percent.



(d) If Parent would be entitled to terminate this Agreement and receive a fee
pursuant to Section 9.5(b)(ii)(A), termination of this Agreement and
collection of such fee shall be the exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser
in respect of any breach, failure, untruth or incorrectness referred to in
paragraph 2(d) of Exhibit A.



9.6. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the
Company, Parent and Purchaser at any time before or after approval of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which requires the approval of the Company
stockholders under applicable Law without such approval. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the
parties hereto.



9.7. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each
Party hereto (for these purposes, Parent and Purchaser shall together be
deemed one Party and the Company shall be deemed the other Party) may (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other Party, (ii) waive any

 

50 inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance by the other Party with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of either Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.
The failure of either Party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 _EXHIBIT A_



_CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_



Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit A and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement to which it is
attached (the "Merger Agreement").



1. Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer and may terminate or, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, amend the Offer, unless prior to the expiration of the initial offering period for the Offer, as the same may be extended (the "Expiration Date") (i) there shall be validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn that number of Shares which, together with the number of Shares, if any, then owned beneficially by Parent or Purchaser (including by reason of the Stockholder Tender Agreement), constitutes at least a majority of the total number of outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis (which shall mean, as of any time, the number of Shares outstanding, together with all Shares which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to any then outstanding warrants, options, benefit plans or obligations or otherwise, whether or not vested or then exercisable) on the date Shares are accepted for payment (the "Minimum Tender Condition"), or (ii) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any other national merger control law or foreign investment regulation shall have expired or been terminated. 



2. Additionally, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject as aforesaid, to pay for any Shares tendered in the Offer and may, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, amend the Offer if any of the following conditions exist: 



     |

(a)

 |



 |

there shall have been any action taken by a Governmental Entity that would, or
is reasonably likely, directly or indirectly, to, (1) restrain, enjoin
or otherwise prohibit any of the transactions contemplated by the Offer or
the Merger Agreement, (2) impose material limitations on the ability of
Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to
acquire or hold, transfer or dispose of, or effectively to exercise all
rights of ownership of, some or all of the Shares including the right to vote
the Shares purchased by it pursuant to the Offer on an equal basis with all
other Shares on all matters properly presented to the stockholders of the
Company, or (3) require, or condition any approval on, the divestiture by
Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates of any
Shares, or require Purchaser, Parent, the Company, or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates to take, or condition any approval on, any action
referred to in Section 7.2(c)(ii) of the Merger Agreement, except as expressly
provided therein; 

---|---|---|--- 
 

C-1      |

(b)

 |



 |

there shall have been threatened (which threat shall not have been withdrawn)
or there shall be pending, any action, proceeding or counterclaim by or before
any Governmental Entity, challenging the making or consummation of the Offer
or the Merger or seeking, directly or indirectly, to result in any of the
consequences referred to in clauses (1) to (3) of paragraph (a) above;

  
---|---|---|--- 



     |

(c)

 |



 |

there shall have occurred any change, circumstance or effect that constitutes
a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company;

  
---|---|---|--- 



     |

(d)

 |



 |

the Company shall have breached or failed to perform or comply in any material
respect with any of its obligations, covenants, or agreements under the
Merger Agreement or any representation or warranty of the Company contained
in the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct; _provided_ that: 

---|---|---|--- 



     |

(i)

 |



 |

all such representations and warranties shall be interpreted without giving
effect to the words "materially" or "material" or to any qualification based
on such terms or based on the defined term "Material Adverse Effect"; 

---|---|---|--- 



     |

(ii)

 |



 |

any such representation or warranty contained in Section 4.2 shall be deemed
untrue if it shall fail to be true and correct except to a _de_ _minimis_
 extent; 

---|---|---|--- 



     |

(iii)

 |



 |

any such representation or warranty (other than any representation or warranty
referred to in clause (ii) above) shall be deemed untrue if such
representation or warranty shall fail to be true and correct in all respects
except where the failure of all such representations and warranties to be true
and correct has not had and would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; 

---|---|---|--- 



in each case at any scheduled expiration of the Offer (except for
representations and warranties made as of a specified date, which need be
true as of the specified date); or



     |

(e)

 |



 |

the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms or shall
have been amended pursuant to its terms to provide for such termination or
such amendment of the Offer; 

---|---|---|--- 



which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or Purchaser, in any case, and
regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent
or Purchaser or any of their affiliates) giving rise to any such condition,
makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or with acceptance for payment
or payment for Shares.

 



The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and,
regardless of the circumstances, may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser in
whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to time prior to the
acceptance for payment of Shares, or

 

2 (except for the Minimum Tender Condition) may be waived by Parent or Purchaser
in its discretion in whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to
time, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure of Parent or
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time. Any
determination by Parent or Purchaser concerning the events described above
will be final and binding on all parties.
