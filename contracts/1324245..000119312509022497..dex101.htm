restrictions are void and unenforceable as going beyond what is fair and
reasonable in all circumstances in respect of any claims made under this
clause 10. 
---|--- 


 

20 Commercial Agreements, the Seller undertakes to the Buyer (for itself and as
trustee for the Company) that it shall not (and shall procure that each
member of the Norwich Union and RAC Group shall not) at any time after
Completion directly or indirectly, whether by itself, its employees or agents
or otherwise howsoever without the consent of the Buyer use, whether on its
own behalf or on behalf of any other person, or divulge to any other person,

---|---|--- 



     | (b) | to the Seller to the extent that it is required to disclose
Confidential Business Information by any applicable law or regulatory body or
the rules of any securities exchange to which it is subject; or 
---|---|---

Seller nor any member of the Sellers Group shall be prohibited from:

the purpose of this sub-clause being 25% or less of the turnover or profits

know-how (of the type described in clause 10.1) which relates to either the
Seller or any member of the Sellers Group, or relates to the Sellers Group

   11.2  | Sellers Solicitors authorised to receive payments 
---|--- 

The Sellers Solicitors are hereby irrevocably authorised by the Seller so to
receive any such amount and receipt of any such amount in such an account or

   12 | Guarantee in respect of the Buyer 
---|--- 



   12.1  | Subject to the provisions of clause 13.11, the Guarantor
irrevocably and unconditionally: 
---|---

each obligation of the Buyer contained in clauses 4.1, 9.9(a), 9.9(b)(i),
9.9(b)(iii)(A), paragraph 3 of schedule 2 and paragraphs 2.1 and 6 of
schedule 8 of this Agreement (Payment Clauses); 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | shall indemnify the Seller in respect of any reasonable
expenses incurred by the Seller or any member of the Sellers Group in seeking

---|---|---

shall on demand by the Seller perform all such obligations of the Buyer
pursuant to the provisions of the Payment Clauses as if it were primarily
liable for the obligations under such clauses.



   12.2  | The Guarantors obligations under clause 12.1 are primary
obligations and not those of a mere surety. If an obligation of the Buyer is
void, voidable or unenforceable for any reason, the Guarantors obligations
under this clause are unaffected and the Guarantor shall perform the Buyers
obligations as if it were primarily liable for the performance. 
---|--- 


   12.3  | The Guarantors obligations under clause 12.1 are continuing
obligations and shall remain in full force until all the obligations of the
Buyer pursuant to the Payment Clauses have been fully performed and all sums
payable by the Buyer have been fully paid. 
---|--- 



   12.4  | The Guarantors liability under clause 12.1 shall not be
affected by: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | any intermediate payment or settlement of account or by any
change in the constitution or control of, or the insolvency of, or bankruptcy,
winding-up or analogous proceedings relating to the Buyer; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | any agreement or arrangement which the Seller makes with the
Buyer or with any person which (but for this clause 12.4) would or might
operate to diminish or discharge the liability of a surety; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | any re-arrangement or alteration of terms (whether of this
Agreement or otherwise); or 
---|---|--- 

  

 

22 of the obligations imposed by this Agreement or any granting of time for such
performance. 
---|---|--- 


   12.5  | Until the full and final discharge of all obligations (whether
actual or contingent) which are the subject of the guarantee and indemnity in
this clause, the Guarantor:  
---|--- 



     | (a) | waives all rights it has or may have to require the Seller
to proceed first against, or claim payment from, the Buyer; 
---|---|--- 


     | (b) | until such time as all obligations of the Buyer under this
Agreement for which the Guarantor may be responsible are satisfied in full,
waives all rights of subrogation, indemnity and reimbursement against the
Buyer and agrees not to demand or accept any security from the Buyer in
respect of any such rights and not to prove in competition with the Seller in
the insolvency, liquidation or bankruptcy of the Buyer; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | agrees not to claim or enforce payment (whether directly or
by set-off, counterclaim or otherwise) of any amount which may be or has
become due to the Guarantor by the Buyer if and so long as the Buyer is in
default of the provisions of the Payment Clauses. 
---|---|--- 



   12.6  | The guarantee and indemnity in this clause shall extend to all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Seller in enforcing this
guarantee and indemnity and/or in suing for or recovering any monies due to
it under or in respect of the obligations which are the subject of the
guarantee and indemnity in this clause. 
---|---

or obligation arising under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document

to enforce any of its terms under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act
1999; and

Third Parties) Act 1999, the Parties may rescind or vary this Agreement (and
Transaction Documents) without the consent of that person.

any statement, warranty, representation, collateral contract or other
assurance given or made by any of the Parties in relation to the subject
matter of this Agreement, save for those expressly set out in this Agreement

Agreement and any other Transaction Document will, so far as they are capable

Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

Agreement are cumulative with and not exclusive of any rights or remedies

   15.1  | Escalation procedure: If either Party (Claimant) reasonably
considers that it may have a claim and a right to commence arbitration
proceedings against the other in relation to any of the Transaction Documents
then, prior to the relevant Party taking any such action, the Claimant will
serve notice on the other Parties specifying in reasonable detail the nature
of the claim so as to identify the grounds of the claim and the factual basis
of it and, so far as is practicable, an estimate of the amount claimed in
respect of it. Within 10 Business Days of service of such notice, the Parties
will meet to discuss the Claimants concerns. If, following such meeting and
the expiry of the said 10 Business Days, an agreement has not been reached
between the Parties as to what action shall be taken, then the matter shall be
referred to the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Seller and the
General Counsel (or his designee) of the Guarantor (on behalf of the Buyer)
for resolution within a further 10 Business Days and, if they are unable to
agree within that period, then arbitration proceedings may be commenced under
clause 15.2.  
---|--- 



   15.2  |

Arbitration: Following compliance with the Escalation Procedure pursuant to
clause 15.1, or in the event of any failure by one or other of the Parties
to comply with the terms thereof, any dispute arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity
or termination shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under
the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) rules (Rules), which

shall be a Queens Counsel and practising member of the English Bar
(Arbitrator), appointed by agreement between the Parties within 10 Business
Days of a written request by one of the Parties to the other for the dispute
to be referred to arbitration pursuant to this clause. Within 5 Business Days
of the agreement between the Parties on the identity of the Arbitrator, the
Claimant shall forward to the Registrar of the LCIA a request pursuant to
Article 1 of the Rules which shall include the name and contact details of
the Arbitrator required by Rule 1(e). In the absence of agreement between the
Parties on the appointment of the   

---|--- 



 

27  Arbitrator within 10 Business Days of the request therefor, then either
Party may serve a request on the Registrar of the LCIA Court pursuant to
Article 1 of the Rules and ask the LCIA Court to appoint the Arbitrator
pursuant to Article 5 of the Rules. Article 6 of the Rules shall not apply.
The seat of arbitration shall be London, England and the language to be used
in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. 

---|--- 



   15.3  | Interim and conservatory relief: For the avoidance of doubt,

     | (b) | paragraph 7 of Part 1 of Schedule 6; 
---|---|--- 

save that clauses 15.1 and 15.2 shall apply where the issue or dispute
concerns whether a Party is in breach of any of the provisions of schedule 8
or schedule 6 (as the case may be).

93 Part 5 - Specific Accounting Policies



   1 | Use of estimates 
---|--- 

The preparation of the Consideration Accounts requires estimates and
assumptions to be made. These estimates shall be based on the Companys
management teams best knowledge of current facts, and circumstances; it is
acknowledged that, to some extent, future events, actions and actual results
ultimately may differ from those estimates, possibly significantly.



   2 | Revenue recognition 
---|--- 

Revenue represents income from the sale of vehicle provenance data on a
transactional basis with income recorded upon provision of the service.
Subscription revenue shall be recognised evenly on the subscription term. Any
income received in advance shall be treated as deferred income and included
in other liabilities.



   3 | Property and equipment 
---|--- 



   3.1 | Owner-occupied properties shall be carried at their re-valued
amounts, supported by market evidence, and movements shall be taken to a
separate reserve within equity. When such properties are sold, the
accumulated revaluation surpluses shall be transferred from this reserve to
retained earnings. All other items classed as property and equipment within
the balance sheet shall be carried at historical cost less
accumulated depreciation. 
---|--- 



   3.2 | No depreciation shall be provided on owner-occupied properties
since such depreciation would be immaterial. Depreciation shall be calculated
on the straight-line method to write down the cost of other assets to their
residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Computer equipment \- three to five years 
---|---|--- 


     | (b) | Office equipment \- five years 
---|---|--- 


     | (c) | Fixtures and fittings \- five years 
---|---|--- 


   3.3 | Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its
estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal of property and
equipment shall be determined by reference to their carrying amount and taken
into account in determining operating profit. 
---|--- 



   3.4 | Repairs and maintenance shall be charged to the income statement
during the financial period in which they are incurred. 
---|--- 


   4 | Impairment of non financial assets 
---|--- 

Property and equipment and other non financial assets shall be reviewed for
impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable.



   5 | De-recognition and offset of financial assets and financial
liabilities 
---|--- 



   5.1 | A financial asset (or where applicable, a part of a financial
asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) shall be derecognised
where: 
---|--- 


     | (a) | the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have
expired; 
---|---|--- 



 

94 from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without
material delay to a third party under a "pass though" arrangement; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows
from the asset and either: 
---|---|--- 


     | (i) | has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of
the asset; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the
risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 
---|---|--- 


   5.2 | A financial liability shall be recognised when the obligation
under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
---|--- 


   5.3 | Financial assets and liabilities shall be offset and the net
amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right
to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a
net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
---|--- 



   6 | Trade receivables 
---|--- 



   6.1 | Trade receivables shall be recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less a
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables
shall be established when there is objective evidence that the Company will
not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of
receivables: 
---|--- 


     | (a) | A credit note provision shall be held to cover specific
known credits to be raised; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | A bad debt provision equal to 100% of the balance
outstanding shall be held against overdrawn advance cash customers, sales
ledger accounts on block due to liquidation or gone away and sales ledger
90+ balances which are greater than £100 shall be reviewed in detail and
provided against where necessary, 
---|---|--- 

the amount of the annual change in such provisions shall be recognised in the
Consideration Accounts.



   7 | Cash and cash equivalents 
---|--- 

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at banks and in hand, deposits held
at call with banks, treasury bills and other short term highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which
are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Such investments
shall be those with less than three months maturity from the date of
acquisition and include certificates of deposit.



   8 | Leases 
---|--- 



   8.1 | Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of
ownership are retained by the lessor, shall be classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases (net of incentives received form the
lessor) shall be charged to the Consideration Accounts on a straight line
basis over the period of the lease. 
---|--- 



   8.2 |

Leases of equipment where the Company has substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership shall be classified as finance leases. Finance leases
shall be capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of fair value of
the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each
lease payment shall be allocated between the liability and finance charges   

---|--- 



 

95  so as to achieve constant rate on the finance on the finance balance
outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges,
shall be included in other long term payables. The interest element of the
finance cost shall be charged to the Consideration Accounts over the lease
payment so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability for each period. The equipment acquired under the
finance leases shall be depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the
asset or the asset term. 

---|--- 



    9 | Employee benefits 
---|--- 

HPI makes contributions to defined contribution pension plan, the assets of
the scheme being held separately from the assets of the Company. Company
contributions shall be charged to the Consideration Accounts in the year to
which they relate and shall be included in staff costs. Differences between
contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid shall be
shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.



   10 | Provisions and contingent liabilities 
---|--- 



   10.1  | Provisions shall be recognised when the Company has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation
can be made. Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed, for
example for environmental restoration, restructuring costs and legal claims,
the reimbursement shall be recognised as a separate asset but only when the
reimbursement is more probable than not. 
---|--- 



   10.2  | The Company offers customers a warranty against potential
losses arising from errors in the accuracy and quality of data provided to the
customer. The Company bears the risk of warranty claims itself. The provision
shall be reviewed in terms of current outstanding claims, claims history and
total HPI Checks carried out to ensure an adequate provision is maintained.
The provision at the end of each accounting period is expected to be utilised
with the next two years. The provision in the year end balance sheet shall be
calculated as 2.5 times the actual claims paid during the calendar year ending
on the balance sheet date. 
---|--- 


   10.3  | Contingent liabilities shall be disclosed if there is a
possible future obligation as a result of a past event, or if there is a
present obligation as a result of a past event but either payment is not
probable or the amount cannot be reliably estimated. 
---|--- 



   11 | Management charges 
---|--- 

Any management charges, fees and/or similar expenses charged by the Buyer
and/or members of the Buyers Group to the extent that they are on terms other
than arms length terms shall be added back to profit before interest and tax
in arriving at EBITDA.



   12 | Opening balances 
---|--- 

For the purposes of the Consideration Accounts in respect of Year 1, the
opening balance sheet will be the closing balance sheet as per the Company
management accounts for December 2008 modified by any changes arising from the
above statement of principles, in particular the calculation of the warranty
provision.

The provisions of this part 5 of schedule 8 shall apply to the calculation of
all EBITDA and references herein to Company shall following a Group
Reorganisation be construed to apply to the Relevant member of the Buyers
Group which conducts HPI Business.
