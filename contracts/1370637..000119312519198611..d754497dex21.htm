(a)  _Merger_ _of_ _Merger Sub_ _into th_ _e Company_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the surviving

(b) _Effects_ _of the_ _Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

(c) _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,

offices of Fenwick and West LLP, 902 Broadway, Suite 14, New York, NY 10010, or
remotely by the exchange of documents and signatures (or their electronic
counterparts), or at such other location as Acquirer and the Company agree,
at:

(i) 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on a date to be agreed by Acquirer and the
Company, which date shall be no later than the third Business Day following
the date on which all of the conditions set forth in Article VI have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are
intended to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions); _provided_ that, if such date of satisfaction
and/or waiver would occur on or after August 12, 2019, then Acquirer may, in
its discretion, delay the Closing to any subsequent Business Day occurring up
to and including October 6, 2019 by providing written notice to the Company,
in which case the Closing shall be held on such subsequent Business Day, so
long as, as of the date the Closing would have otherwise occurred but for
this proviso, (A) the conditions in Section 6.1 have been satisfied or waived
in writing by each of Acquirer and the Company, (B) the conditions in Section
6.2 (other than in Section 6.2(c)) have been satisfied or waived in writing

the " _Satisfaction Event_ "); _provided_ _further_ that, if Acquirer elects
to delay the Closing in accordance with the foregoing proviso, (I) Acquirer
shall be obligated, regardless of any event, circumstance or occurrence that
arises after the Satisfaction Event, and regardless of whether any such event,
circumstance or occurrence, individually or in the aggregate, would otherwise
cause the failure of any condition set forth in Article VI to be
satisfied, to effect the Closing on or before October 6, 2019, so long as
between (and including) the Satisfaction Event and the Closing, (x) the
Company has not intentionally and materially breached any of the covenants
made by it in this Agreement and (y) the conditions set forth in Section
6.1(b), Section 6.3(c) and Section 6.3(d) continue to be satisfied, (II)
Acquirer shall provide written notice to the Company indicating the date of
the actual Closing at least three Business Days prior to such date and (III)

delivered, Acquirer shall make each of the deliveries required pursuant to
Section 6.2(c) and (y) the Company shall redeliver each of the deliveries
required pursuant to Sections 1.2(b)(iii), (ix), (x), (xiii) and (xvi), and a

by a duly elected officer of the Company, to the effect that the Company has
not intentionally and materially breached any of the covenants made by it in
this Agreement between the date of the Satisfaction Event and the Closing; or

 

(ii) such other date and time and/or such other location as Acquirer and the
Company agree in writing.

of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
later time as Acquirer and the Company agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

(e) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_.
Unless otherwise determined by Acquirer and the Company prior to the
Effective Time:

1.3 _Effect_ _on Capital Stock and Options_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Capital Stock and Company Options and Company
Warrants_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of any party hereto, Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder, Company
Warrantholder or any other Person:

 

(i) _Company Capital Stock_.

 

(A) Each share of Company Common Stock held by a Company Stockholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and
shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock) shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to and in
accordance with Section 1.4, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
Common Per Share Consideration.

(B) Each share of Company Series A-1 Stock held by a Company
Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares and shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock) shall be
cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to
and in accordance with Section 1.4, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the Series A-1 Per Share Consideration.

 

(C) Each share of Company Series A-2 Stock held by a Company Stockholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and
shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock) shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to and in
accordance with Section 1.4, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the Series A-2 Per Share Consideration.

(D) Each share of Company Series B Stock held by a Company Stockholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and
shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock) shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to and in
accordance with Section 1.4, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
Series B Per Share Consideration.

 

(E) Each share of Company Series B-2 Stock held by a Company Stockholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and
shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock) shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to and in
accordance with Section 1.4, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the Series B-2 Per Share Consideration.

(F) The amount of cash each Company Stockholder holding shares of Company
Capital Stock is entitled to receive for such shares of Company Capital Stock
shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash
amounts for all shares of Company Capital Stock held by such Company
Stockholder.

(ii) _Company Options_.

 

(A) _Vested Company Options_. Each Vested Company Option that is unexpired,
unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
terminated and cancelled at the Effective Time and shall not be assumed by
Acquirer, and no Vested Company Option shall be substituted with any
equivalent option or right to purchase or otherwise acquire any capital stock
or other securities of Acquirer. Upon cancellation thereof, each Vested
Company Option shall be converted into and represent the right to receive,
subject to and in accordance with Section 1.4, an amount in cash, without
interest, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock underlying such
Vested Company Option, equal to the excess of (x) the Common Per Share
Consideration over (y) the per share exercise price of such Vested Company
Option, to the extent a positive number (collectively, the " _Option
Payments_ "). The amount of cash each Company Optionholder holding Vested
Company Options is entitled to receive for such Vested Company Options shall
be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts
for all such Vested Company Options held by such Company Optionholder and will

accordance

 



6

    

 with Section 1.9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Unvested Company Options held by Continuing Employees and Continuing
Contractors providing services to the Company in Japan and the Netherlands
shall be treated as Vested Company Options for purposes of this Agreement and
each Unvested Company Option held by such Company Optionholders shall be
converted into and represent the right to receive the Option Payments.

(B) _Unvested Company Options Held by Continuing Employees and Continuing
Contractors_. Each Unvested Company Option held by a Continuing Employee or a
Continuing Contractor (other than a Continuing Employee or Continuing
Contractor providing services to the Company in Japan or the Netherlands) that
is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be terminated and cancelled at the Effective Time. Upon
cancellation thereof, each such Unvested Company Option shall be substituted
by Acquirer with an award of Acquirer restricted stock units (an "
_Acquirer RSU_ ") representing the opportunity to receive a number of shares
of Acquirer Common Stock equal to (x) (i) the excess of (1) the Common Per
Share Consideration over (2) the per share exercise price of such
Unvested Company Option, to the extent a positive number, _multiplied by_
(ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such
Unvested Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided
by_  (y) the Acquirer Stock Price, rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Acquirer Common Stock. The Acquirer RSUs granted in substitution
of Unvested Company Options pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(ii)(B), which will
be made pursuant to a stock unit agreement in substantially the form filed by
Acquirer with the SEC, shall not result in an extension of such Unvested
Company Options and shall include the same vesting schedule and vesting terms
and conditions as were in effect with respect thereto as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, no vesting acceleration shall occur by
reason of the Merger or any subsequent event, such as termination of
employment.

 

(C) _Unvested Company Options Held by Persons Other than Continuing Employees
or Continuing Contractors; Excluded Company Options_. Each Unvested Company
Option, other than those held by Continuing Employees or Continuing

to be taken all actions, if any, as may be required to reserve for issuance a
number of authorized but unissued shares of Acquirer Common Stock for delivery
upon settlement of the Acquirer RSUs. Acquirer will cause the registration of
the shares of Acquirer Common Stock subject to the Acquirer RSUs to be
effective as part of a registration statement on Form S-8 as of the Closing
and will use the same level of efforts that it uses to maintain the
effectiveness of its other registration statements on Form S-8 to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any Acquirer RSUs
remain outstanding.

 

(F) _Company Warrants_. Each Company Warrant, whether vested or unvested,
shall, without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be
cancelled and extinguished and shall not be assumed by Acquirer in the Merger
as of the Effective Time. Upon cancellation thereof, each Company Warrant
shall be converted into and represent the right to receive, subject to and
in accordance with Section 1.4, an amount in cash, without interest, with
respect to each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Warrant,
equal to the excess of (x) the Common Per Share Consideration over (y) the per
share exercise price of such Company Warrant, to the extent a positive number
(collectively, the " _Warrant Payments_ "). The amount of cash the Company
Warrantholder is entitled to receive for such Company Warrants shall be

(iii) _Aggregate Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in no event shall the aggregate amount of cash to
be paid by Acquirer to the Company Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement
exceed $275,000,000, _plus_ (i) the sum of (A) an amount equal to the Closing
Net Working Capital Surplus, if any, and (B) an amount equal to the amount of
Closing Company Cash, _minus_ (ii) the sum of (A) an amount equal to the
Closing Net Working Capital Shortfall, if any, (B) an amount equal to
the Closing Company Debt, (C) an amount equal to Transaction Expenses that
are incurred but unpaid as of the Closing and (D) an amount equal to the
Unvested Option Payout Amount.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company_. At the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by the
Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment of any
cash or other property or consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

 

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquirer, Merger Sub or
any other Person, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the
shares of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub
capital stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving
Corporations capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after
the Effective Time). From and after the Effective Time, each certificate
evidencing ownership of a number of shares of Merger Sub capital stock will
evidence ownership of such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(d) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital
Stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time,
all references herein to specified numbers of shares of any class or series
affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon
numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefor) affected
thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the
parties the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like change.

(e) _Apprais_ _al R_ _ights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right
to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, but shall
instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the DGCL, becomes
entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive payment therefor
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (but only after the
value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to
such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall
lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall
immediately be deemed to have converted at the Effective Time into the right
to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of
such shares as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and Acquirer
shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as
reasonably practicable after) the applicable time or times specified in
Section 1.4(a), following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set
forth in Section 1.4(a), the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares. The Company shall provide
to Acquirer prompt notice of any demands for appraisal or purchase received by
the Company in writing, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
related to such demands served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Acquirer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), or as otherwise required under the DGCL, voluntarily make any
payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares, in each case,
to the extent such payment, offer or settlement involves any obligations by
or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary that could reasonably be
expected to survive the Closing. Subject to Section 8.2, the payout of
consideration under this Agreement to the Company

 



8

    

 Securityholders (other than in respect of Dissenting Shares, which shall be
treated as provided in this Section 1.3(e) and under the DGCL) shall not be
affected by the exercise or potential exercise of appraisal rights under the
DGCL by any other Company Stockholder.

(f) _No Interest_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
no interest shall accumulate on any cash payable in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions, except as provided in the Escrow Agreement
with respect to the cash amounts in the Escrow Fund.

 

1.4 _Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) _Surrender of_ _Certificates_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, to the extent not

Dissenting Shares to holders thereof, as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within three Business Days) following the submission of a Certificate
to the Paying Agent and a duly executed Letter of Transmittal (including any
applicable attachments thereto or other documentation required thereby) by
such Company Stockholder.

 

(v) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such document to

holding Vested Company Options, subject to Section 1.4(d) and Section 1.4(e),
through Acquirers or the Surviving Corporations payroll system in
accordance with standard payroll practices, and subject to any required
withholding for applicable Taxes; _provided_ that such payment to such Company
Optionholder shall be made only if such Company Optionholder shall have
delivered a duly executed option waiver in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit O_ (the " _Option Waiver_ ") prior to the Closing, and otherwise,
Acquirer shall cause such Option Payment to be paid to such Company
Optionholder through Acquirers or the Surviving Corporations payroll system
in accordance with standard payroll practices, and subject to any required

Securityholders Closing Pro Rata Share (solely with respect to Company
Capital Stock, Vested Company Options and Company Warrants) of the Escrow
Amount, and shall deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent pursuant to
Section 8.1. The Escrow Fund shall in all cases constitute the initial source
of recovery and partial security for the benefit of Acquirer (on behalf of
itself or any other Acquirer Indemnified Person) with respect to any
Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the
Company Securityholders under Section 1.6 and Article VIII, and the Escrow
Fund shall be held and distributed in accordance with Section 1.6 and Section
8.1. The adoption of this Agreement by the Company Securityholders shall
constitute, among other things, approval of the Escrow Amount, the withholding

(f) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amount payable pursuant to Section
1.3(a) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the
Certificate or Company Option surrendered in exchange therefor is registered,
it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that such Certificate or
Company Option shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of cash in any name
other than that of

 



10

    

 the registered holder of such Certificate or Company Option, or established
to the reasonable satisfaction of Acquirer or any agent designated by Acquirer
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

1.4, no party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,

Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of such
Certificate or Company Option. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if any Certificate or Company Option has not been
surrendered prior to the earlier of the first anniversary of the Effective
Time and such date on which the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of such Certificate or Company
Option would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity, any amounts payable in respect of such Certificate or
Company Option shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the
property of Acquirer, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

1.5 _No Further Ownership Rights in the_ _Company Capital Stock_ _, Company
Options or _ _Company Warrants_. The applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration paid or payable following the surrender for exchange of the
Certificates and Company Options in accordance with this Agreement shall be

of Company Capital Stock represented by such Certificates or issuable pursuant
to such Company Options, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Capital Stock or Company Options that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or
document or instrument representing a Company Option is presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificate, document or instrument
(and the underlying shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Options) shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

 

1.6 _Company Net Working Capital_ _,_ _Company Debt_ _,_ _Company Cash_ _and_
_Transaction Expenses _ _Adjustment_.

(a) Pursuant to Section 5.13, the Company shall deliver the Company Closing
Financial Certificate to Acquirer not later than three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date.

(b) Within 60 days after the Closing, Acquirer shall deliver to
the Securityholders Agent a spreadsheet containing final calculations of the
Company Net Working Capital as of the Adjustment Calculation Time and the
Company Debt that is outstanding, the Company Cash and the Transaction
Expenses that are incurred but unpaid, in each case, as of the Closing (the "
_Acquirer Calculations_ "), together with such supporting documentation,
information and calculations as are reasonably necessary for Securityholders
Agent to verify and determine the calculations, amounts and other matters set
forth in the Acquirer Calculations. The Acquirer Calculations shall be
determined, in each case, in good faith, on a consolidated basis in accordance
with the Accounting Principles. The parties agree that the purpose of
preparing the Acquirer Calculations and calculating the final Merger
Consideration is solely to (x) accurately measure the Company Net Working
Capital, Company Debt, Company Cash and/or Transaction Expenses and (y)
measure the difference in Final Net Working Capital from Closing Net Working
Capital Target, and such processes are not intended to permit the introduction
of different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, reserves classifications or estimation methodologies for the
purpose of calculating the final Merger Consideration than were used in the
calculation of estimated Merger Consideration. Acquirer shall (and
if applicable, shall cause its Affiliates to), following the Closing through
the date that the calculations of the Company Net Working Capital, Company
Debt, Company Cash and Transaction Expenses become conclusive and binding upon
the parties in accordance with this Section 1.6, maintain any books, records,
policies or procedures on which the Acquirer Calculations are

 



11

    

 based in a manner sufficient to calculate and review the Acquirer
Calculations utilizing the methods required by this Agreement.

 

(c)

(i) The Securityholders Agent may object to the calculation of Company Net
Working Capital, Company Debt, Company Cash and/or Transaction Expenses set
forth in the Acquirer Calculations by providing written notice of such
objection to Acquirer within 30 days after Acquirers delivery of the
Acquirer Calculations (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), together with
supporting documentation, information and calculations necessary for Acquirer
to verify the Notice of Objection. Any matters not expressly set forth in a
timely Notice of Objection shall be deemed to have been accepted by the
Securityholders Agent on behalf of the Company Securityholders.

 

(ii) Upon receipt of the Acquirer Calculations, the Securityholders Agent and
its Representatives may make inquiry of Acquirer and Acquirer shall promptly
make available to the Securityholders Agent and its Representatives the books
and records relating to the Acquirer Calculations, or otherwise promptly
provide responses to the Securityholders Agents inquiries sufficient to
calculate and review the Acquirer Calculations, in each case, as reasonably
requested by the Securityholders Agent in connection with its review of the
Acquirer Calculations.

 

(d) If the Securityholders Agent timely provides the Notice of Objection,
then Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent shall confer in good faith for a
period of up to 10 Business Days following Acquirers timely receipt of the
Notice of Objection in an attempt to resolve any disputed matter set forth in
the Notice of Objection, and all such discussions and negotiations related
thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Acquirer and the Representative) be
governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (as in effect as of the
Agreement Date) and any applicable similar state rule, and any resolution
by them shall be in writing and shall be final and binding on the parties
hereto and the Company Securityholders.

(e) If, after the 10 Business Day period set forth in Section 1.6(d),
Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent cannot resolve any matter set forth in
the Notice of Objection, then Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent shall
engage Ernst and Young LLP or, if such firm is not able or willing to so act,
another nationally recognized auditing firm acceptable to both Acquirer and
the Securityholders Agent (the " _Reviewing Accountant_ ") to review only the
matters in the Notice of Objection that are still disputed by Acquirer and
the Securityholders Agent and the Acquirer Calculations to the extent
relevant thereto. After such review and a review of the Companys relevant
books and records, the Reviewing Accountant shall promptly (and in any event
within 60 days following its engagement) determine the resolution of such
remaining disputed matters, which determination shall be final and binding on
the parties hereto and the Company Securityholders, and the Reviewing
Accountant shall provide Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent with a
calculation of Company Net Working Capital, Company Debt, Company Cash and/or
Transaction Expenses in accordance with such determination. The
Reviewing Accountant shall consider only those items and amounts that were
set forth in the Acquirer Calculations and the Notice of Objection and that
remain unresolved by Acquirer and Securityholders Agent, and shall make a
final determination of Company Net Working Capital, Company Debt, Company
Cash and/or Transaction Expenses. The parties will execute a customary
engagement letter and cooperate with the Reviewing Accountant during the term
of its engagement. Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent shall instruct the
Reviewing Accountant not to, and the Reviewing Accountant shall not, assign a
value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned by Acquirer, on the one hand, or the Securityholders Agent, on the

(f) If the sum of (i) Company Net Working Capital as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.6(b), Section 1.6(d) and/or Section 1.6(e), as the case
may be (the " _Final Net Working Capital_ "), _plus_ (ii) the Closing Net
Working Capital Shortfall, if any, _minus_ (iii) the Closing Net Working
Capital Surplus, if any, is:

(A) less than the Closing Net Working Capital Target (such difference, the "
_Final Net Working Capital Shortfall_ "), then the Company Securityholders
shall severally but not jointly in accordance with their respective Indemnity
Pro Rata Shares indemnify and hold harmless Acquirer, for the full amount of
the Final Net Working Capital Shortfall; or

(B) more than the Closing Net Working Capital Target (such difference, the "

amount of such Final Net Working Capital Surplus to be deposited in cash with
the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Company Securityholders in
accordance with their respective Escrow Distribution Pro Rata Shares, subject
to the Company Securityholder Payment Procedures.

(g) If the amount of Company Debt as finally determined pursuant to Section
1.6(b), Section 1.6(d) and/or Section 1.6(e), as the case may be (the " _Final
Company Debt_ ") is greater than the amount of Company Debt indicated in the
Company Closing Financial Certificate, then the Company Securityholders shall
severally but not jointly in accordance with their respective Indemnity Pro
Rata Shares indemnify and hold harmless Acquirer for the full amount by
which the Final Company Debt exceeds the amount of Company Debt indicated in
the Company Closing Financial Certificate. If the amount of Final Company Debt
is less than the amount of Company Debt indicated in the Company Closing
Financial Certificate, then Acquirer shall cause the full amount of such
difference to be deposited in cash with the Paying Agent for further
distribution to the Company Securityholders in accordance with their
respective Escrow Distribution Pro Rata Shares, subject to the Company
Securityholder Payment Procedures.

(h) If the amount of Company Cash as finally determined pursuant to Section
1.6(b), Section 1.6(d) and/or Section 1.6(e), as the case may be (the "
_Final Company Cash_ ") is less than the amount of Company Cash indicated in

Company Cash indicated in the Company Closing Financial Certificate. If the
amount of Final Company Cash is more than the amount of Company Cash indicated

other hand, based upon the percentage of the dollar value of the disputed
amounts determined in favor of the other party by the Reviewing Accountant
bears to the dollar value contested by such party in the written presentation
to the Reviewing Accountant. For example, if the

 



13

    

 Securityholders Agent contests only $500 of the amount set forth in the
Acquirer Calculations in the Notice of Objection, and if the Reviewing
Accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Acquirer $300 of the
$500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Reviewing Accountant will
be allocated 60% (i.e., $300/$500) to the Company Securityholders and 40%
(i.e., $200/$500) to Acquirer. The determination of Company Net Working
Capital, Company Debt, Company Cash and/or Transaction Expenses, shall become
final and binding on the parties on the date the Reviewing Accountant delivers
its final resolution in writing to the parties. The Reviewing Accountant shall
act as an expert only, and not as an arbitrator, and shall not be engaged to,
and shall not, make any ruling or provide any opinion on any matter that could
constitute a breach of any representation or covenant contained herein.

 

(k) For illustrative purposes, Schedule 1.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth the calculation of the Company Net Working Capital as of December
31, 2018, which calculations have been prepared in accordance with the
specific accounting methods, practices, policies and principles (including
classification and estimation methodologies) described therein (collectively,
the " _Accounting Principles_ "). In furtherance of the foregoing, the
calculation of the Company Net Working Capital, Company Debt that is
outstanding, Company Cash and the Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the
Company Closing Financial Certificate and the Acquirer Calculations shall, in
each case, not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of
purchase or other accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or
resulting as a consequence of the Transactions. The calculation of the
Company Net Working Capital shall be determined as of the Adjustment
Calculation Time, and the calculation of the Company Debt that is outstanding,
Company Cash and the Transaction Expenses shall be determined as of the
Closing, each based on a "closing of the books" methodology and will exclude
the effect of any act, decision or event occurring on or after the Closing.

 

1.7 _Tax Consequences_. Neither Acquirer nor Merger Sub makes any
representations or warranties to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or to
any Company Securityholder regarding the Tax treatment of the Merger, or any
of the Tax consequences to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any
Company Securityholder of this Agreement, the Transactions or the other
agreements contemplated by this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that the
Company and the Subsidiaries and the Company Securityholders are relying
solely on their own Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement, the
Transactions and the other agreements contemplated by this Agreement.

Acquirer, on the other hand. The Company Securityholders and Acquirer shall,
at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to their share of Transfer Taxes. To the extent applicable,
Company Securityholders and Acquirer shall reimburse each other for any
Transfer Taxes paid by them in connection with the filing of Tax Returns with
respect to Transfer Taxes within 10 calendar days after receipt from the other
of written notice of payment thereof and a copy of the associated filed Tax
Returns.

1.9 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payments of
cash pursuant to this Agreement to any Named Employee, any Continuing Employee
or any holder of any shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Options, Company
Warrants or Certificates, such amounts in cash as Acquirer, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to any such payments under the Code or any provision of state, local,
provincial or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such Persons in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. The parties shall cooperate with each other, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize or eliminate any potential deductions and
withholdings under applicable Tax law, and to ensure that the person in
respect of which/whom any such deduction and withholding was made is able to
receive the full benefit of such deductions and withholdings to the extent
provided by applicable Tax law.

1.10 _Further Action_. Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be done
and performed, all such further acts and things, and shall execute and
deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, as
the other party may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent and
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions.

for the Company, and (B) abided by any privacy choices (including opt-out

covenants or similar terms in relation to Processing or Personal Data,
confidentiality, security measures and agreed to compliance with those
obligations that are sufficient for the Companys compliance with Privacy
Laws and Company Privacy Commitments in all material respects, and, to the
extent required by applicable Privacy Laws, there is in existence a written
Contract between the Company and each such data processor that complies in
all material respects with the requirements of all Privacy Laws and Company
Privacy Commitments. The Company and the Subsidiaries have made available to
Acquirer copies of all such Contracts. To the knowledge of the Company, such

2.12 _Employee Benefit Plans and Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(i) Schedule 2.12(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, with respect
to the Company, the Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliate, (A) all "employee
benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), (B) each loan to an
employee, (C) all stock option, stock purchase, phantom stock, stock
appreciation right, restricted stock unit, supplemental retirement, severance,
sabbatical, medical, dental, vision care, disability, employee relocation,
cafeteria benefit (Section 125 of the Code), dependent care (Section 129 of
the Code), life insurance or accident insurance plans, programs or
arrangements, (D) all bonus, pension, profit sharing, savings, severance,
retirement, deferred compensation or incentive plans (including
cash incentive plans), programs or arrangements, (E) all other fringe or
employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements and (F) all employment,
individual consulting, retention, change of control or executive compensation
or severance agreements, in each case, written or otherwise, formal or
informal, as to which any unsatisfied obligations of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries remain for the benefit of, or relating to, any present or former
employee, consultant or non-employee director of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (all of the foregoing described in clauses (A) through (F),
collectively, the " _Company Employee Plans_ ").

 

(ii) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.12(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company does not sponsor or maintain any self-funded employee
benefit plan, including any plan to which a stop-loss policy applies. The
Company has made available to Acquirer a true, correct and complete copy of
each of the Company Employee Plans and related plan documents (including trust
documents, insurance policies or Contracts, employee booklets, summary plan
descriptions and other authorizing documents, actuarial reports, financial
statements, and any material employee communications relating thereto) and
has, with respect to each Company Employee Plan that is subject to ERISA
reporting requirements, provided to Acquirer true, correct and complete copies
of the Form 5500 reports filed for the last three plan years. Any Company
Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has
either obtained from the IRS a favorable determination letter as to its
qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to the Code effected
by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, or has applied (or
has time remaining in which to apply) to the IRS for such a determination
letter prior to the expiration of the requisite period under applicable
Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such
determination letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination or has been established under a standardized prototype
plan for which an IRS opinion letter has been obtained by the plan sponsor and
is valid as to the adopting employer. The Company has provided to Acquirer a
true, correct and complete copy of the most recent favorable IRS determination
or opinion letter issued with respect to each such Company Employee Plan, and
nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter that would
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the

 



33

    

 Tax-qualified status of any Company Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a)
of the Code. Each trust established in connection with any Company Employee
Plan that is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section
501(a) of the Code is so exempt, and no fact or event has occurred that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the exempt status of any such
trust. All individuals who, pursuant to the terms of any Company Employee
Plan, are entitled to participate in any Company Employee Plan or have been
offered an opportunity to do so.

 

(iii) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical
or other retiree welfare benefits to any person other than as required under
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("
_COBRA_ ") or similar state law and the Company has complied in all material
respects with the requirements of COBRA. There has been no "prohibited
transaction" (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of
the Code and not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA and regulatory guidance
thereunder) with respect to any Company Employee Plan. Each Company Employee
Plan has, in all material respects, been maintained and administered in
accordance with its terms and in compliance with the requirements prescribed
by any and all statutes, rules and regulations (including ERISA and the Code),
and the Company and each of the Company and the Subsidiaries and each ERISA
Affiliate has performed all obligations required to be performed by it under,
is not in default under or in violation of, and has no knowledge of any
default or violation by any other party to, any of the Company Employee
Plans. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate
is subject to any Liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the
Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any Company Employee Plans. All
contributions required to be made by the Company, each of the Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate to any Company Employee Plan have been made on or before
their due dates and a reasonable amount has been accrued for contributions to
each Company Employee Plan for the current plan years (and no further
contributions will be due or will have accrued thereunder as of the Closing
Date, other than contributions accrued in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice after the Company Balance Sheet Date as a
result of the operations of the Company after the Company Balance Sheet Date).
In addition, with respect to each Company Employee Plan intended to include a
Code Section 401(k) arrangement, the Company, each of the Subsidiaries and
each of the ERISA Affiliates have at all times made timely deposits of
employee salary reduction contributions and participant loan repayments, as
determined pursuant to regulations issued by the United States Department of
Labor. No Company Employee Plan is covered by, and neither the Company nor any
of the Subsidiaries nor ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any
Liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302
of ERISA. Each Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise
discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without
Liability to Acquirer (other than ordinary and reasonable administrative
expenses typically incurred in a termination event). With respect to each
Company Employee Plan subject to ERISA as either an employee pension benefit
plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an employee
welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, the
Company, each of the Subsidiaries and, in each case, any applicable ERISA
Affiliate thereof have prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite
governmental reports (which were true, correct and complete as of the date
filed), including any required audit reports, and have properly and timely
filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees required
to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Company Employee
Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding, action, litigation or claim has been
brought, or to the knowledge of the Company, is threatened, against or with
respect to any such Company Employee Plan, including any audit or inquiry by
the IRS or United States Department of Labor. With respect to each Company
Employee Plan, (i) no material breaches of fiduciary duty or other failures to
act or comply in connection with the administration or investment of the
assets of such Company Employee Plan have occurred, and (ii) no lien has been
imposed under the Code, ERISA or any other Applicable Law, and (iii) the
Company has not made any filing in respect of such Company Employee Plan under
the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System, the Department of Labor
Delinquent Filer Program or any other voluntary correction program. No Company
Employee Plan is maintained through a human resources and benefits outsourcing
entity or professional employer organization.

(iv) Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries nor any current or former
ERISA Affiliate currently maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes
to, or has ever maintained, established, sponsored,

 



34

    

 participated in, or contributed to, any pension plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

(v) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any
Company Employee Plan that would materially increase the expense of
maintaining such Company Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred
with respect to such Company Employee Plan for the most recent full fiscal
year included in the Financial Statements.

 

(vi) Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate
is a party to, or has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any
obligation under, or has any Liability (actual or contingent) with respect to,
any "multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,
any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" as such term is defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA or any "multiple employer plan" as such term is defined
in Section 413(c) of the Code.

 

(vii) No Company Employee Plan is sponsored, maintained or contributed to
under the law or applicable custom or rule of any jurisdiction outside of the
United States.

(viii) Other than as set forth in Schedule 2.12(a)(viii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, none of the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, the consummation of the Transactions, any termination of employment
or service and any other event in connection therewith or subsequent thereto
will, individually or together or with the occurrence of some other event
(whether contingent or otherwise), (A) result in any material payment or
benefit (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute,
bonus or otherwise) becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to
any current or former employee, director, independent contractor or
consultant, (B) materially increase the amount or value of any benefit or
compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any current or
former employee, director, independent contractor or consultant, (C) result
in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such
benefit or compensation, (D) result in the forgiveness in whole or in part of
any outstanding loans made by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to any
current or former employee, director, independent contractor or consultant or
(E) limit the Companys ability to terminate any Company Employee Plan. Other
than as set forth in Schedule 2.12(a)(viii) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
no amount paid or payable by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in
connection with the Transactions, whether alone or in combination with another
event, will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code or Section 4999 of the Code or will not be deductible by the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a benefit under, or require any
consent, approval or waiver from any Person pursuant to, (i) any provision of
the articles or certificate of incorporation, as applicable, or bylaws or
other equivalent organizational or governing documents of Acquirer and Merger
Sub, in each case as amended to date or (ii) Applicable Law, except for the
approval of Acquirer as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub or where such

obligations under this Agreement.

foregoing, an " _Antitrust Restraint_ "); _provided_ that the Company shall,

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement (including Sections 5.10, 5.11 and

way the right of Acquirer to terminate reassign, promote or demote any
employee, consultant, director or other service provider (or to cause any of
the foregoing actions) at any time following the Closing, or to change (or
cause the change of) the title, powers, duties, responsibilities, functions,
locations, salaries, other compensation or terms or conditions of employment
or service of any such employee, consultant, director or other service
provider at any time following the Closing, (ii) constitute an amendment or
modification of any Company Employee Plan or other employee benefit plan,

consultant, director or other service provider (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) or (iv) obligate Acquirer or any of its Affiliates to adopt
or maintain any particular plan or program or other compensatory or benefits
arrangement at any time or prevent Acquirer or any of its Affiliates from
modifying or terminating any such plan, program or other compensatory or
benefits arrangement at any time.

thereof. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
review and approval by Acquirer. The Company also shall take such other
actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee Plans as Acquirer
may reasonably require. In the event that termination of the Companys 401(k)
Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender
charges or other fees then

 the Company or the Subsidiaries shall take such actions as are necessary to
reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such
estimate in writing to Acquirer.

 

5.12 _Waivers for_ _Promised Company Options_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a Promised Option

practicable following its execution, but in no event later than three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (to the extent obtained three
Business Days or more prior to the Closing Date); _it_ _being_ _understood_
_and_ _agreed_ that any amounts payable by the Company in order to obtain such
waiver (including the employer portion of any related payroll taxes with
respect thereto but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Acquirer RSUs
to be granted in lieu of such Promised Company Options pursuant to such
Promised Option Releases as described therein) shall be treated as a
Transaction Expense.

5.13 _Certain_ _Closing_ _Certificates and Documents_. The Company shall
prepare and deliver to Acquirer a draft of each of the Company Closing
Financial Certificate and the Spreadsheet not later than five Business Days
prior to the Closing Date and a final version of the Company Closing
Financial Certificate and the Spreadsheet to Acquirer not later than three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. In the event that Acquirer notifies
the Company that there are errors in the drafts of the Company Closing
Financial Certificate and the Spreadsheet, Acquirer and the Company shall
discuss such errors in good faith and, if applicable, the Company shall
correct such errors (as determined in good faith by the Company) prior to
delivering the final versions of the same in accordance with this Section
5.13. Without limiting the foregoing or Section 5.7, the Company shall provide
to Acquirer, together with the Company Closing Financial Certificate and the
Spreadsheet, such supporting documentation, information and calculations as
are reasonably necessary for Acquirer to verify and determine the
calculations, amounts and other matters set forth in the Company Closing

sheet as of the Closing prepared on a consistent basis with the Company

(a) Each of Acquirer, the Securityholders Agent, the Company Securityholders
and the Company shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any of the others, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
and any Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon request therefor) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to any such Legal Proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Acquirer, the
Company and the Subsidiaries, the Securityholders Agent and the Company
Securityholders agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company and the Subsidiaries relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of
limitations of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority.

(b) The Company shall cause each Company Securityholder to further agree,
upon Acquirers request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person
as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed (including with respect to the Transactions).

(c) Acquirer and the Company intend that the cash payable to the holders of
Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) will be treated as
received in exchange for the applicable holders Company Capital Stock, and
agree to report such payments for income Tax purposes as consideration for
such holders Company Capital Stock and, except as otherwise required by
Applicable Law, not as compensation for services.

 



57

    

(d) __Tax Returns__.

 

(i) The Securityholders Agent shall cause to be prepared and cause to be

Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, whether
to be filed before, on or after the Closing Date (" _Seller Prepared Returns_
"). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with existing
procedures and practices and accounting methods unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law. At least 30 days prior to the due date of any Seller Prepared
Return, the Securityholders Agent shall submit such Seller Prepared Return to
Acquirer for review. The Securityholders Agent shall cause the tax preparer
to incorporate any reasonable comments made by Acquirer. Acquirer shall cause
the Company or applicable Subsidiary of the Company to sign and timely file
the Seller Prepared Return due after the Closing Date in the form submitted by
the Securityholders Agent (as adjusted to reflect Acquirers reasonable
comments).

(ii) Acquirer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to prepare and
timely file all Tax Returns (other than Seller Prepared Returns) of the
Company and each its Subsidiaries due after the Closing Date (the " _Acquirer
Prepared Returns_ "). To the extent that an Acquirer Prepared Return relates
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period, such Tax Return shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with existing procedures and practices and
accounting methods unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. At least 30
days prior to the due date of any Acquirer Prepared Return that shows Pre-
Closing Income Taxes or that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Acquirer
shall provide a draft of such Tax Return to the Securityholders Agent for the
Securityholders Agents review and comment. Acquirer shall cause the Company
or applicable Subsidiary of the Company to incorporate any reasonable
comments made by the Securityholders Agent in the Tax Return actually filed.

 

(iii) To the extent such action will increase the Company Securityholders
indemnification obligations under this Agreement, Acquirer shall not, and
shall not allow the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to amend any Tax Return
of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period without
the prior written consent of the Securityholders Agent (which will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned) unless such amendment is
required by Applicable Law. Prior to entering into any voluntary disclosure
agreement with any Governmental Entity that relates to Taxes of the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Acquirer shall
consult with the Securityholders Agent and consider in good faith
any reasonable comments made by the Securityholders Agent. All liabilities
that arise pursuant to any such voluntary disclosure agreements in any
applicable jurisdiction shall be apportioned in good faith in a fair and
reasonable between the Company and any of the applicable Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Acquirer and any of its applicable subsidiaries that pursue a
similar voluntary disclosure agreement in such jurisdiction, on the other
hand.

 

(iv) The Company Securityholders and Acquirer agree that no election under
Code Section 338(g) shall be made with respect to the acquisition of the
shares of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) __Tax Contests__. If any Governmental Entity issues to the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company (i) a notice of its intent to audit or conduct
another Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company or Subsidiary of
the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or (ii) a
notice of deficiency for Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period, Acquirer shall notify the Securityholders Agent of its receipt of
such communication from the Governmental Entity within thirty (30) days of
receipt. No failure or delay of Acquirer in the performance of the foregoing
shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the
Company Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent such
failure or delay materially prejudices the Company Securityholders or
Securityholders Agent. The Company or applicable Subsidiary of the Company
shall control any audit or other Legal Proceeding in respect of any Tax Return
or Taxes of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Tax Contest_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the 

 



58

    

 Securityholders Agent, at the Company Securityholders sole cost and
expense, shall have the right to control or participate in any such Tax
Contest to the extent it relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (y) the
Securityholders Agent, at the Company Securityholders sole cost and expense,
shall have the right to participate in any such Tax Contest to the extent it
relates to a Straddle Period, and (z) Acquirer shall not allow the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company to settle or otherwise resolve any Tax Contest
if such settlement or other resolution relates to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period without the prior written permission of the
Securityholders Agent (which will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned) and the Securityholders Agent shall not agree to settle or
otherwise resolve any Tax Contest without the consent of Acquirer (which will
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).

 

(f) __Tax Refunds__. All refunds of Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (whether in the form of cash
received or offset against Taxes otherwise payable) shall be for the benefit
of the Company Stockholders except to the extent such refund or offset
was included in the calculation of Company Net Working Capital, as finally
determined. To the extent that Acquirer, the Company, or any Subsidiary of the
Company receives a refund that is for the benefit of the Company Stockholders,
Acquirer shall pay to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Company
Stockholders the amount of such refund (and interest received from the
Governmental Entity with respect to such refund). The amount due to the
Company Stockholders shall be payable 10 days after receipt of the refund
from the applicable Governmental Entity (or, if the refund is in the form of
offset, 10 days after the due date of the Tax Return claiming such offset).
Acquirer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to take all
actions necessary, or requested by the Securityholders Agent, at the Company
Securityholders cost and expense, to timely claim any refunds that will give
rise to a payment under this Section 5.14(f).

 

5.15 _280G Stockholder Approval_. To the extent applicable, promptly following
the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Acquirer a Parachute Payment
Waiver from each "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code). Promptly following the delivery of the Parachute Payment
Waivers to Acquirer (but in no event less than three Business Days prior to
the Closing), the Company shall submit to the Company Stockholders for
approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer), by such number of
holders of Company Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that may separately or
in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of
the Code (" _Section_ __ _ 280G Payments_") (which determination shall be
made by the Company and shall be subject to review and approval by Acquirer,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), such
that such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G
Payments, and prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Acquirer
notification and documentation reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer (and
which documentation shall be subject to Acquirers advanced review and
approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) that (i) a vote of the holders of Company Capital Stock was solicited
in conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder and the requisite stockholder approval was obtained with respect to
any payments and/or benefits that were subject to the stockholder vote (the "
_280G Stockholder Approval_") or (ii) that the 280G Stockholder Approval was
not obtained and as a consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall
not be made or provided to the extent they would cause any amounts to
constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the Parachute Payment Waivers
that were executed by the affected individuals prior to the solicitation of
the vote of the holders of Company Capital Stock pursuant to this Section
5.15.

5.16 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Acquirer acknowledges that (i) each Person that prior to the Closing
served as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any
Subsidiary (collectively, the " _D andO_ _Indemnified Persons_ "), is entitled
to indemnification, expense reimbursement and exculpation to the extent
provided in the organizational or governing documents of the Company in
effect as of the Agreement Date and the agreements set forth on Schedule
5.16(a) (" _D andO Provisions_"), (ii) such DandO Provisions are rights of
Contract and (iii) Acquirer shall 

 



59

    

 cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company to the DandO Indemnified Persons pursuant to the DandO
Provisions with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or before the Closing. For a period of at least six years from the Closing
Date, Acquirer and the Surviving Corporation will not, and will not permit any
of their Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any DandO Provision in any
manner adverse to any DandO Indemnified Person in respect of claims arising from
facts or events occurring on or before the Effective Time, and Acquirer and
the Surviving Corporation will cause all such provisions to be observed by
their Subsidiaries, it being the intent of the parties that any DandO
Indemnified Person will continue to be entitled to such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Law.

(b) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase and maintain
in effect for a period of six years thereafter, (i) a tail policy to the
current policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company, which tail policy shall be effective for a period from the
Closing through and including the date six years after the Closing Date with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Closing, and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same coverage
and amounts as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous
than, in the aggregate, the coverage currently provided by such current
policy and (ii) "run off" coverage as provided by the Companys fiduciary and
employee benefit policies, in each case, covering those Persons who are
covered on the date hereof by such policies and with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less advantageous than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies (collectively, the "
_Tail Policy_ "); _provided_ that, in the event that any claim is brought
under any such policy before the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, such
insurance policy will be maintained until final disposition thereof. Acquirer
and the Surviving Corporation will not, and will cause their subsidiaries to
not, cancel or change such insurance policy in any respect. If the cost of the
Tail Policy is paid in full prior to the Closing, 50% of such cost shall be
accounted for (and borne by Acquirer) as an increase in amount of Closing
Company Cash, and otherwise, to the extent unpaid as of the Closing, 50% of
such cost shall be accounted for as a Transaction Expense hereunder.

 

(c) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of expenses as
provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which any DandO Indemnified Person may at any time be entitled. No right or
remedy herein conferred by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any
other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or
now or hereafter existing at Law or in equity or otherwise. Acquirer and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that the DandO Indemnified Persons have or may in
the future have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or
insurance provided by other Persons (collectively, other than the provider(s)
of the Tail Policy, the " _Other_ _Indemnitors_ "). Acquirer and Merger Sub
hereby agree that, with respect to any advancement or indemnification
obligation owed at any time to a DandO Indemnified Person by the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to the DandO Provisions, the Surviving Corporation shall
be, and, after the Effective Time, Acquirer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to be, the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., the Surviving
Corporations obligations to a DandO Indemnified Person shall be primary and any
obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by a DandO
Indemnified Person shall be secondary) without regard to any rights that a DandO
Indemnified Person may have against the Other Indemnitors;  _provided_ that
the first recourse of each DandO Indemnified Person shall be against the Tail
Policy to the extent recovery under the Tail Policy is available until it is
exhausted before recovery against Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Affiliates shall take place. Furthermore, Acquirer
irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors from any
and all claims (x) against the Other Indemnitors for contribution,
subrogation, indemnification or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof and (y) that the DandO Indemnified Person must seek expense advancement,
reimbursement or indemnification from any Other Indemnitor before the
Surviving Corporation or Acquirer must perform its expense advancement,
reimbursement and indemnification obligations pursuant to the DandO Provisions.

 



60

    

(d) In the event that Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries or any of the respective successors or assigns of the foregoing
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties, rights or assets to any Person, then, in
each case, the successors and assigns of such Persons or properties, rights
or assets, as the case may be, must expressly assume in writing and be bound
by the obligations set forth in this Section 5.16 as a condition of succession
of assignment.

 

(e) This Section 5.16 is intended to be for the benefit of each of the DandO
Indemnified Persons and may be enforced by any such DandO Indemnified Person as
if such DandO Indemnified Person were a party to this Agreement. The obligations
of Acquirer and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.16 will not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person to
whom this Section 5.16 applies without the consent of such affected Person.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.16, the first
recourse of each DandO Indemnified Person shall be against the Tail Policy
until it is exhausted before recovery against Acquirer shall take place.

Company of: (a) any written notice or other communication from any Person to
Acquirer or Merger Sub alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the Transactions; (b) any written notice or other
communication from any Governmental Authority to Acquirer or Merger Sub
related to or in connection with the Transactions; (c) any Legal Proceeding
commenced or, to the knowledge of Acquirer threatened in writing against,
involving or otherwise affecting Acquirer, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates that, if pending on the Agreement Date, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.3 or that relate to the
consummation of the Transactions; and (d) any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of Acquirer or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would reasonably be expected
to cause any condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) not to be satisfied;
_provided_ that, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.17 will
not limit any of the representations and warranties of Acquirer or Merger Sub
set forth in this Agreement or the remedies available hereunder to the
Company.

5.18 _Contact with Business Relations_. Without limiting the provisions of
Section 5.7, Acquirer and Merger Sub acknowledge that they are not authorized
to, and agree that they will not, and Acquirer will not authorize or permit
any of its subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives
to, contact any customer, supplier, distributor or other material business
relation of the Company or the Subsidiaries before the Closing, in each case,
solely with regards to the Company, the Subsidiaries, the Business or the
Transactions, without receiving the prior written consent of the Company (not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) before each such contact.

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve prior to
the Closing the dispute existing as of the Agreement Date as to overlap of

Escrow Fund delivered to the Securityholders Agent on or prior to the Escrow
Release Date in accordance with this Article VIII. On a claim by claim basis,
any portion of the Escrow Fund held by the Escrow Agent following the Escrow
Release Date with respect to a pending but unresolved claim for
indemnification that is not awarded to Acquirer upon the resolution of such
claims shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent for further
distribution to the Company Securityholders in accordance with their
respective Escrow Distribution Pro Rata Shares within five Business Days
following resolution of such claim.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, from and after
the Closing, each Company Securityholder, shall severally but not jointly
(with such several Liability determined on the basis of such Company
Securityholders Indemnity Pro Rata Share) indemnify, defend and hold harmless

directors, agents and employees and each Person, if any, who controls or may
control Acquirer within the meaning of the Securities Act (each, an "
_Indemnified Person_ ") from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse

of, resulting from or in connection with:

(i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Company in
Article II to be true and correct (I) as of the Agreement Date (except in the
case of representations and warranties that by their terms speak only as of a
specified date or dates, which representations and warranties shall be true

breach of any of the covenants, agreements or obligations made by the Company
herein to be performed prior to the Closing;

(iii) any inaccuracies in the Spreadsheet;

 

(iv) any payments made with respect to Dissenting Shares to the extent that
such payments, in the aggregate, exceed the value of the consideration that

exchange of such Dissenting Shares, and any interest, costs, expenses and fees
incurred by any Indemnified Person in connection with the exercise of any
dissenters or appraisal rights;

(v) any claims by (A) any then-current or former holder or alleged then-
current or former holder of any Equity Interests of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (in each case, including any predecessors thereof), including any
Company Option Promisee or Excluded Optionholder, solely in such capacity,
arising out of, resulting from or in connection with (I) the Transactions or
this Agreement, including the allocation of the Merger Consideration or any
portion thereof (including as a result of any calculation made from time to
time of the Pro Rata Share of any Company Securityholder), or (II) such
Persons status or alleged status as a holder of Equity Interests of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries (in each case, including any
predecessors thereof) at any time at or prior to the Closing, whether for
breach of fiduciary duty or otherwise, (B) any Person to the effect that such
Person is entitled to any Equity Interest of Acquirer or the Company or any
payment in connection with the Transactions by action of the Company prior to
the Closing other than as specifically set forth on the Spreadsheet or (C) any
Person with respect to any Company Option Plan or any other plan, policy or
Contract of the Company providing for compensation to any Person in the form
of Equity Interests by action of the Company prior to the Closing;

(vi) any claims by any Company Securityholder arising out, resulting from or

(viii) any Pre-Closing Income Taxes to the extent not taken into account
in calculating the Company Net Working Capital;

(x) any Fraud by the Company.

 

(b) Materiality standards or qualifications and qualifications by reference to

Indemnifiable Damages with respect to such inaccuracy, other than
with respect to Section 2.5(ii) and the representations and warranties that
expressly require disclosure of lists of items of a material nature or above a
specified threshold.

 

8.3 _Indemnifiable Damage_ _Threshold; Other Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Indemnified
Person may make a claim in respect of any claim for Indemnifiable Damages
arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in
Section 8.2(a)(i) (other than claims arising out of, resulting from or in
connection with (i) Fraud by the Company or (ii) any failure of any of the
Special Representations to be true and correct as specified in Section
8.2(a)(i), (A) if such Indemnifiable Damages (together with any other
Indemnifiable Damages arising out

 



67

    

 of or relating to the same underlying inaccuracy, breach, deficiency,
circumstance or facts) are in an aggregate amount less than $20,000 (the "
_Minimum_   _Threshold_ ") and (B) subject to the limitation set forth in
clause (A), unless and until Indemnifiable Damages in an aggregate amount in
excess of $1,500,000 (the " _Basket_ ") shall have been actually incurred or
paid by the Indemnified Persons, in which case the Indemnified Person may make
claims for indemnification, compensation and reimbursement and may receive
cash from the Escrow Fund for all Indemnifiable Damages (including the amount
of the Basket), in all cases subject to this Article VIII. The Minimum
Threshold and the Basket shall not apply to any other Indemnifiable Damages or
claims therefor.

 

(b) If the Merger is consummated, recovery from the Escrow Fund shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for the indemnity obligations of
each Company Securityholder under this Agreement for Indemnifiable Damages
(and not specific performance or other equitable remedies) arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in Section 8.2(a)(i),
except (i) in the case of Fraud by the Company and (ii) any failure of any of
the Special Representations to be true and correct as aforesaid. Following the
Closing, no Indemnified Person shall bring any claim with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, other
than (A) as part of the process contemplated by Section 1.6(f), (B) a claim
for Fraud against the Person who committed such Fraud, (C) a claim made by
Acquirer on behalf of the Indemnified Persons in accordance with Section 8.2
or (D) a claim made by Acquirer pursuant to any other Transaction Document;
_provided_ , that any party may seek equitable relief, including the remedies
of specific performance and injunction in accordance with Section 9.11. The
provisions of this Article VIII constitute an integral part of the
consideration given to the Company Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement
and were specifically bargained for and reflected in the total amount of the
Merger Consideration payable in connection with the Transactions.

(c) In the case of any claims for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with the failure of any of the Special
Representations to be true and correct as aforesaid or the matters listed in
clauses (ii) through (x) of Section 8.2(a) (collectively, " _Special Claims_
"), after Indemnified Persons have exhausted or made claims upon all amounts
held in the Escrow Fund (after taking into account all other claims for
indemnification, compensation and reimbursement from the Escrow Fund made by
Indemnified Persons), or following the Escrow Release Date, each Company
Securityholder shall have Liability on a several but not joint basis for such
Company Securityholders Indemnity Pro Rata Share of the amount of any
Indemnifiable Damages resulting therefrom, in all cases subject to this
Article VIII.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the amounts
that an Indemnified Person recovers from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Special
Claims shall not reduce the amount that an Indemnified Person may recover with
respect to claims that are not Special Claims. By way of illustration and not
limitation, assuming there are no other claims for indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement, in the event that Indemnifiable Damages
resulting from a Special Claim are first satisfied from the Escrow Fund
and such recovery fully depletes the Escrow Fund, the maximum amount
recoverable by an Indemnified Person pursuant to a subsequent claim that is
not a Special Claim shall continue to be the full dollar value of the Escrow
Fund irrespective of the fact that the Escrow Fund was used to satisfy such
Special Claim, such that the amount recoverable for such two claims would be
the same regardless of the chronological order in which they were made.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) in no event
shall the aggregate Liability of a Company Securityholder pursuant to this
Agreement for any claims (other than Special Claims) exceed the Escrow Fund;
and (ii) the total Liability of a Company Securityholder for all claims
(including Special Claims) shall be limited to the aggregate amount of
cash actually received (on a gross basis and not net of any Taxes) by such
Company Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ that each
Company Securityholders total Liability with respect to any failure of the
representations and warranties made by the Company in Section 2.10(s) (other
than clauses (i) and (ii) thereof) (Data Privacy, Security and Information
Technology) to be true and correct as provided in Section 8.2(a)(i) (a "
_Privacy Claim_ ") shall be limited to such Company Securityholders
Indemnity Pro Rata Share of $50,000,000.

 



68

    

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) other than
as set forth in Section 8.3(g), the DandO Provisions and the Tail Policy, in
each case, solely with respect to any Third-Party Claim, no Company
Securityholder shall have any right of indemnification, compensation,
reimbursement, contribution or right of advancement from Acquirer, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Indemnified Person (based upon such Company
Securityholders position as an officer, director, employee or agent of the
Company or otherwise) with respect to any Indemnifiable Damages claimed by
any Indemnified Person or any right of subrogation against the Company or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to any indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement of an Indemnified Person by reason of any of the matters set
forth in Section 8.2(a), (ii) the rights and remedies of the Indemnified
Persons after the Effective Time shall not be limited by any investigation by
or on behalf of, or disclosure to (other than in the Company Disclosure
Letter with respect to Section 8.2(a)(i), subject to any limitations
expressly set forth therein), any Indemnified Person at or prior to the
Effective Time regarding any failure, breach or other event or circumstance,
(iii) if an Indemnified Persons claim under this Article VIII may be
properly characterized in multiple ways in accordance with this Article VIII
such that such claim may or may not be subject to different limitations
depending on such characterization, then such Indemnified Person shall have
the right to characterize such claim in a manner that maximizes the recovery
and time to assert such claim permitted in accordance with this Article VIII
and (iv) no Company Securityholder shall be liable for the breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of another Company Securityholder or any
Fraud by any Person other than the Company.

 

(g) All Indemnifiable Damages shall be calculated net of any Tax Benefit and
net of any Third-Party Recoveries. To the extent an Indemnified Person
realizes a Tax Benefit or receives a Third-Party Recovery in respect of an
Indemnifiable Damage subsequent to payment by the Company Securityholders in
respect of such Indemnifiable Damage (including by means of release of Escrow
Funds to an Indemnified Person), the Indemnified Person shall pay to the
Paying Agent for further distribution to the Company Securityholders in
accordance with their respective Escrow Distribution Pro Rata Shares an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of such Third-Party
Recoveries and (ii) the aggregate amount paid by the Company Securityholders
to the Indemnified Persons in respect of such Indemnifiable Damage (including
by means of release of Escrow Funds to an Indemnified Person). " _Third-Party
Recoveries_ " shall mean the amount of any recoveries actually received by an
Indemnified Person under any insurance policies and contractual
indemnification or contribution provisions (in each case, calculated net of
any actual collection costs, expenses, deductibles or premium adjustments or
retrospectively rated premiums (as reasonably determined in good faith by
Acquirer) incurred or paid to procure such recoveries) in respect of
any Indemnifiable Damages incurred or paid by any Indemnified Person;
_provided_ that Acquirer, each Indemnified Person and the Affiliates of each
such Person shall, to the extent required by Applicable Law, use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages. "
_Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any actual refund of Taxes paid or any reduction in
the amount of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid, for the calendar
year in which the Indemnifiable Damage was incurred and the subsequent
calendar year, net of the Tax cost of receiving such refund or reduction, in
each case computed on a "with and without" basis, treating deductions
attributable to the Damages as the last items claimed.

(h) No Indemnified Person shall make a claim to indemnification under this
Article VIII without the prior written consent of Acquirer and, to the extent
any Indemnifiable Damages would be satisfied from the amount then held in the
Escrow Fund, (i) unless such claim is made against all Company Stockholders,
Company Optionholders holding Vested Company Options and Company
Warrantholders and (ii) no Indemnified Person shall offer to compromise any
claim unless the same offer is made to all such Company Securityholders to
which the applicable claim has been made. For the avoidance of doubt, Acquirer
shall have sole discretion to determine whether to make a claim for
indemnification against any particular Company Securityholder to the extent
the related Indemnifiable Damages would be satisfied other than from the
Escrow Fund. The Company Securityholders shall not be responsible for any
Indemnifiable Damage arising out of any change in any legal requirement or
GAAP that takes place after the Closing, or if a Satisfaction Event occurs,
after the Satisfaction Event. Acquirer shall not be entitled to recover
damages or obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than
once in respect of any one Indemnifiable Damage. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary

 



69

    

 contained in this Agreement, Acquirer shall have no right to any
indemnification hereunder with respect to any Indemnifiable Damage or alleged
Indemnifiable Damage to the extent (i) such Indemnifiable Damage or alleged
Indemnifiable Damage is included in the calculation of Company Net Working
Capital, Company Debt, Company Cash and/or Transaction Expenses, in each case,
as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.6 or (ii) the matter forming the
basis for such Indemnifiable Damage or alleged Indemnifiable Damage is the
same matter for which Acquirer requested a reduction of Company Cash or the
Company Net Working Capital or requested an increase in the Company Debt or
Transaction Expenses.

8.4 _Period for Claims_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.4,
the period (the " _Claims Period_ ") during which claims may be made (i) for
Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the
matters listed in Section 8.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to any of
the Special Representations) shall commence at the Closing and terminate at
11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the Escrow Release Date and (ii) for Indemnifiable
Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with all other
matters, including Special Claims, shall commence at the Closing and
terminate at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the date that is 30 days following (A)
in the case of claims for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from
or in connection with (I) the failure of any of the representations and
warranties made by the Company in Section 2.11 (Taxes) to be true and correct
as aforesaid, insofar as such representations or warranties relate to income
Taxes or (II) Pre-Closing Income Taxes, in each case, the date that is six
years and 30 days following the Closing Date, or if a Satisfaction Event
occurs, the date that is six years and 30 days following the Satisfaction
Event, and (B) in all other cases, 30 days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations; _provided_ that the Claims Period for any
Privacy Claim shall commence at the Closing and terminate upon the date that
is four years and 30 days following the Closing Date, or if a Satisfaction
Event occurs, the date that is four years and 30 days following the
Satisfaction Event. No claim by an Indemnified Person for Indemnifiable
Damages in respect of a breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement may be brought subsequent to
expiration of the applicable Claims Period, except any such claim of which the
Securityholders Agent has received a Claim Certificate prior to expiration
of the applicable Claims Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, such portion of the Escrow Fund as may be necessary to
satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied claims for Indemnifiable Damages
specified in any Claim Certificate delivered to the Securityholders Agent on
or prior to the Escrow Release Date shall remain in the Escrow Fund until such
claims for Indemnifiable Damages have been resolved or
satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Claims Period for claims for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting
from or in connection with Fraud shall not be limited. In addition,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any claim for Indemnifiable
Damages that is based on a breach Section 4.1(e) shall be subject to the
limitations on Indemnifiable Damages set forth herein that apply to claims
made pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i), as applicable. 

8.5 _Claims_.

(a) From time to time during the applicable Claims Period, Acquirer may
deliver to the Securityholders Agent one or more certificates signed by any
officer of Acquirer (each, a " _Claim_ _Certificate_ "):

 

(i) stating that an Indemnified Person has incurred or paid or in good faith
believes that it may incur or pay Indemnifiable Damages (or with respect to
any Tax matters, stating that an Indemnified Person reasonably and in good
faith believes that a Tax Authority would reasonably be expected to raise such
matter in an audit of Acquirer or its subsidiaries and such matter would
reasonably be expected to give rise to Indemnifiable Damages);

(ii) stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case of
Indemnifiable Damages not yet incurred or paid may be the maximum amount
believed by Acquirer in good faith to be incurred or paid or demanded by a
third party); and

 

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Acquirer) the individual items of such Indemnifiable Damages
included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such
Indemnifiable Damages are related.

 



70

    

(b) Such Claim Certificate (i) need only specify such information to the
knowledge of such officer of Acquirer as of the date thereof, (ii) shall not
limit any of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Person with respect to
the underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such Claim
Certificate and (iii) may be updated and amended from time to time by
Acquirer by delivering any updated or amended Claim Certificate, so long as
the delivery of the original Claim Certificate is made within the applicable
Claims Period and such update or amendment relates to the underlying facts
and circumstances specifically set forth in such original Claims Certificate;
_provided_ that all claims for Indemnifiable Damages properly set forth in a
Claim Certificate or any update or amendment thereto shall remain outstanding
until such claims have been resolved or satisfied, notwithstanding the
expiration of such Claims Period. Acquirer shall provide the Securityholders
Agent with such Claims Certificate as promptly as reasonably practicable upon
learning of the facts constituting such claim; _provided_ that no delay in
providing such Claim Certificate within the applicable Claims Period shall
affect an Indemnified Persons rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the
extent that) the Securityholders Agent or the Company Securityholders are
materially prejudiced thereby.

8.6 _Resolution of Objections to Claims_.

(a) If the Securityholders Agent does not contest, by written notice to
Acquirer, any claim or claims by Acquirer made in any Claim Certificate
within the 60-day period following receipt of the Claim Certificate, then the
Escrow Agent shall, upon Acquirers direction, distribute to Acquirer an
amount of cash from the Escrow Fund having a total value equal to the amount
of any Indemnifiable Damages corresponding to such claim or claims as set
forth in such Claim Certificate.

 

(b) If the Securityholders Agent objects in writing to any claim or claims by
Acquirer made in any Claim Certificate within the 60-day period set forth in
Section 8.6(a), Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent shall attempt in good
faith for 45 days after Acquirers receipt of such written objection to
resolve such objection. If Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent shall so
agree, a joint written instruction setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared, signed by both parties and delivered to the Escrow Agent. Upon
receipt of such instruction, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Acquirer an
amount of cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of such joint
written instruction.

(c) If no such agreement can be reached during the 45-day period for good
faith negotiation set forth in Section 8.6(b), but in any event upon the
expiration of such 45-day period, either Acquirer or the Securityholders
Agent may bring an arbitration in accordance with the terms of Section 9.12 to
resolve the matter. The decision of the arbitrator as to the validity and
amount of any claim in such Claim Certificate shall be non-appealable, binding
and conclusive upon the parties hereto and the Company Securityholders, and
Acquirer shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute to
Acquirer an amount of cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.

(d) Judgment upon any determination of an arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. For purposes of this Section 8.6(d), in any suit
hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Claim
Certificate is at issue, Acquirer shall be deemed to be the prevailing party
unless the arbitrator determines in favor of the Securityholders Agent (on
behalf of the Company Securityholders) with respect to more than one-half of
the amount in dispute, in which case the Company Securityholders shall be
deemed to be the prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration
shall pay its own fees and expenses and the reasonable fees and expenses of
the prevailing party, including attorneys fees and costs, reasonably incurred
in connection with such suit.

(e) Any portion of the Escrow Fund that is paid by the Escrow Agent to the
Paying Agent in accordance with Section 8.1(b) shall be distributed to the
Company Securityholders in accordance with their respective Escrow
Distribution Pro Rata Shares, subject to the Company Securityholders Payment
Procedures.

 



71

    

8.7 _Securityholders_ __ _Agent_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Fortis Advisors LLC shall be constituted and appointed as
the Securityholders Agent. The Securityholders Agent shall be the exclusive

and communications permitted or required under this Agreement, or any
other agreement, document or instrument entered into or executed in
connection herewith, for and on behalf of any Company Securityholder, to or
from Acquirer (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) relating

instrument (except to the extent that this Agreement expressly contemplates

Company Securityholder individually), (iii) review, negotiate and agree to and

VIII, (iv) object to such claims pursuant to Section 8.6, (v) consent or agree
to, negotiate, enter into, or, if applicable, contest, prosecute or defend,

of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, such claims, resolve any
such claims, take any actions in connection with the resolution of any dispute
relating hereto or to the Transactions by arbitration, settlement or
otherwise, and take or forego any or all actions permitted or required of any
Company Securityholder or necessary in the judgment of the Securityholders
Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other terms,
conditions and limitations of this Agreement, (vi) consult with legal counsel,
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it, solely at the
cost and expense of the Company Securityholders, (vii) consent or agree to
any amendment to this Agreement or to waive any terms and conditions of this
Agreement providing rights or benefits to the Company Securityholders (other
than with respect to the payment of the Merger Consideration less the Escrow
Amount) in accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein,
(viii) pursuant to Section 1.6, review, negotiate, object to, accept or agree
to Acquirers calculation of Company Net Working Capital and (ix) take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholders Agent
for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek
or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Securityholders Agent shall have no obligation to act on
behalf of the Company Securityholders, except as expressly provided herein, in
the Escrow Agreement and in the Securityholders Agent Engagement Agreement,
and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the Securityholders
Agent in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Company Disclosure
Letter. The Securityholders Agent shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon any
signature reasonably believed by it to be genuine and (ii) reasonably assume
that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable
Company Securityholder or other party. Acquirer, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates (including after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) shall be entitled to rely on the appointment of Fortis Advisors
LLC as the Securityholders Agent and treat such Securityholders Agent as the
duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Company Securityholder and has having

immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Securityholders
Agent Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of
any Company Securityholder and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and
(ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Company Securityholder
of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund.
The Company Securityholders shall be bound by all actions taken and documents
executed by the Securityholders Agent in connection with this Article VIII,
and Acquirer and other Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to rely
exclusively on any action or decision of the Securityholders Agent. The
Person serving as the Securityholders Agent may be removed or replaced from
time to time, or if such Person resigns from its position as the
Securityholders Agent, then a successor may be appointed, by the
Company Securityholders collectively having a Closing Pro Rata Share greater
than 50% and Company Securityholders holding at least 50% of the Company
Series B Stock (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) upon not less
than 30 days prior written notice to Acquirer. The immunities and rights to
indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholders Agent or any member of the

 



72

    

 Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. No bond shall be required of the Securityholders Agent.

 

(b) Certain Company Securityholders have entered into an engagement agreement
(the " _Securityholders  Agent Engagement Agreement_") with the
Securityholders Agent to provide direction to the Securityholders Agent in
connection with its services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Securityholders Agent Engagement Agreement (such Company
Securityholders, including their individual representatives, collectively
hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the
Securityholders Agent nor its members, managers, directors,
officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory
Group (collectively, the " _Securityholders  Agent Group_") shall be liable
to any Company Securityholder for any act done or omitted hereunder, under
the Escrow Agreement or under the Securityholders Agent Engagement Agreement
as the Securityholders Agent while acting in good faith (and any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such
good faith) and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company
Securityholders shall severally but not jointly (with such Liability
determined in accordance with such Company Securityholders Indemnity Pro Rata
Share) indemnify the Securityholders Agent Group and defend and hold the
Securityholders Agent Group harmless against any loss, Liability, claim,
damage, fee, fine, cost, judgment, amount paid in settlement or expense
incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the
part of the Securityholders Agent and arising out of, resulting from or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Securityholders
Agents duties hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under the
Securityholders Agent Engagement Agreement including all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal costs reasonably
incurred by the Securityholders Agent (collectively, the "Securityholders
Agent Expenses"). If not paid directly to the Securityholders Agent by the
Company Securityholders, such Securityholders Agent Expenses may be
recovered by the Securityholders Agent from the portion of the Escrow Fund
otherwise distributable to the Company Securityholders (and not distributed or
distributable to an Indemnified Person or subject to a
pending indemnification claim of an Indemnified Person) on or after the
Escrow Release Date pursuant to the terms hereof, at the time of distribution,
and such recovery will be made from the Company Securityholders according to
their respective Indemnity Pro Rata Shares of such Securityholders Agent
Expenses. The Company Securityholders acknowledge that the Securityholders
Agent shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur
any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Securityholders Agent Engagement Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Securityholders Agent shall
not be required to take any action unless the Securityholders Agent has been
provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in its determination, are
sufficient to protect the Securityholders Agent against the costs, expenses
and liabilities which may be incurred by the Securityholders Agent in
performing such actions.

 

(c) After the Closing, any notice or communication given or received by, and
any decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the
Securityholders Agent that is within the scope of the Securityholders
Agents authority under Section 8.7(a) shall constitute a notice or
communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of all the Company Securityholders and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such Company Securityholder; and all defenses which may
be available to any Company Securityholder to contest, negate or disaffirm the
action of the Securityholders Agent taken in good faith under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the Securityholders Agent Engagement Agreement are
waived. Each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon any
such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every such
Company Securityholder. Acquirer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Indemnified Persons are hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person
for any acts done by them in accordance with such notice, communication,
decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of the
Securityholders Agent.

(d) The Securityholders Agent shall use the Securityholders Agent Fund
to (i) make any payment required to be made for the account of the Company
Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) pay any Transaction Expenses
not otherwise paid at the Closing or taken into account in the calculation of
the Merger Consideration (including any Transaction Expenses incurred after
the Closing) and (iii) pay all Securityholders Agent Expenses incurred by or
on behalf of the Securityholders Agent, in its capacity as such, including
all Securityholders Agent Expenses incurred in connection with any pending
or threatened dispute or claim with respect to this Agreement, any agreement,
document or instrument entered into pursuant to this Agreement, or the
Transactions. The Securityholders Agent Fund will be held or disbursed, in
whole or in part, as determined by the Securityholders Agent in its sole
discretion. The Securityholders Agent is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Securityholders Agent Fund other
than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Securityholders Agent is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar
capacity in connection with the Securityholders Agent Fund, and has no tax
reporting or income distribution obligations. The retention by the
Securityholders Agent of any amounts in the Securityholders Agent Fund
shall not be evidence that the Company Securityholders or the Securityholders
Agent have any liability under this Agreement. Any amounts received by the
Securityholders Agent, in its capacity as such, including any amounts
released from the Escrow Fund, may be used at the Securityholders Agents
discretion to increase the Securityholders Agent Fund. If the
Securityholders Agent determines to release all or a portion of
the Securityholders Agent Fund to the Company Securityholders, such amounts
will be distributed to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the
Company Securityholders in accordance with their respective Escrow
Distribution Pro Rata Shares. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any
amounts payable from the Securityholders Agent Fund to the Company
Securityholders or any other Person hereunder. The determination by the
Securityholders Agent of amounts payable under this Section 8.7(d) shall be
final and binding.

8.8 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Acquirer becomes aware of a claim by a
third party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that Acquirer in good faith believes
may result in a claim for Indemnifiable Damages by or on behalf of an
Indemnified Person, Acquirer shall promptly deliver a Claim Certificate in
respect thereof; _provided_ that no delay in providing such Claim Certificate
within the applicable Claims Period shall affect an Indemnified Persons
rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the
Securityholders Agent or the Company Securityholders are materially
prejudiced thereby. Acquirer shall have the right in its sole discretion to
conduct the defense of and to settle or resolve any such Third-Party Claim
(and the costs and expenses incurred by Acquirer in connection with such
defense, settlement, enforcement or resolution (including reasonable
attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court or
arbitration costs) shall be included in the Indemnifiable Damages for
which Acquirer shall be entitled to receive indemnification pursuant to a
claim made hereunder, and such costs and expenses shall constitute
Indemnifiable Damages subject to indemnification under Section 8.2 to the
extent that it is determined pursuant to Sections 8.5 and 8.6 that such
Third-Party Claim arose out of, resulted from or was in connection with a
matter listed in Section 8.2); _provided_ that Acquirer shall request the
Securityholders Agents written consent prior to entering into any
settlement agreement with respect to any Third-Party Claim (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and in the event
that the Securityholders Agent does not consent to such settlement agreement
in writing, any Indemnifiable Damages shall be determined pursuant to Sections
8.5 and 8.6. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Acquirer may not
assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim that is brought directly against
any Securityholder, and such Securityholder shall maintain the right to defend
any such claims. The Securityholders Agent shall have the right to receive
copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to
such Third-Party Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not
affect any privilege relating to any Indemnified Person, subject to execution
by the Securityholders Agent of Acquirers (and, if required, such third
partys) standard non-disclosure agreement to the extent that such materials
contain confidential or propriety information; _provided_ that in the event
that any privilege would be affected, the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into a joint defense or common privilege
agreement, and provide such copies of all pleadings, notices and
communications not subject to the privilege. The Securityholders Agent shall
have the right to participate as an observer in any Third-Party Claim with
counsel of its choice and at its own expense (on behalf of the Company
Securityholders). However, Acquirer shall have the right in its sole
discretion to 

 



74

    

 determine and conduct the defense of any Third-Party Claim and the
settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Third-Party Claim. In the event
that the Securityholders Agent has consented to the amount of any settlement
or resolution by Acquirer of any such claim (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), neither the Securityholders
Agent nor any Company Stockholder shall have any power or authority to object
under this Article VIII to the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Person against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such
settlement or resolution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, (i) to the extent the provisions of Section 5.14(e) are inconsistent
with this Section 8.8, the provisions of Section 5.14(e) shall govern any
Third-Party Claim relating to Taxes and (ii) the Securityholders Agent shall
not object to a claim for costs and expenses incurred by Acquirer in
connection with the defense, enforcement, settlement or resolution (including
reasonable attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court
or arbitration costs) of a Third-Party Claim on the basis that there has been
no ultimate determination (including a judgment of a court or a finding of an
arbitral body) with respect to such Third-Party Claim to the extent Acquirer
is otherwise entitled to indemnification for Indemnifiable Damages with
respect to such Third-Party Claim hereunder.

8.9 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Acquirer, the Securityholders
Agent and the Company Securityholders agree to treat (and cause their
respective Affiliates to treat) any payment received by the Indemnified
Persons pursuant to Section 1.6 or this Article VIII as adjustments to the
Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes to the maximum extent permitted by
Applicable Law.

8.10  _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

(a) The parties to this Agreement acknowledge and agree that (i) except for
the representations and warranties contained in Article II, and those made by
the Company Securityholders in their respective Stockholder Agreements,
Letters of Transmittal, Option Waivers, Promised Options Releases and Non-
Competition Agreements, as applicable, none of the Company Securityholders,
the Company, any Subsidiary or any other Person, respectively, has made or
makes any other express or implied representation or warranty, either written
or oral, on behalf of the Company Securityholders, the Company or any
Subsidiary, including any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries made available to Acquirer and its Representatives or as to
the future revenue, profitability or success of the Company or the
Subsidiaries, or any representation or warranty arising from any legal
requirement and (ii) except for the representations and warranties contained
in Article III, none of Acquirer, Merger Sub or any other Person,
respectively, has made or makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty, either written or oral, on behalf of Acquirer or Merger Sub,
including any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of
any information regarding Acquirer or any of its subsidiaries made available
to the Company and its Representatives or as to the future revenue,
profitability or success of Acquirer or its subsidiaries, or any
representation or warranty arising from any legal requirement. Acquirer
further acknowledges and agrees that it has relied solely on the
representations and warranties contained in Article II and in the Stockholder
Agreements, Letters of Transmittal, Option Waivers, Promised Options Releases
and Non-Competition Agreements, as applicable, in determining to enter into
this Agreement and effectuate the Transactions, and it expressly disclaims
any reliance on any other representations or omissions of fact, including,
without limitation, information, documents or materials made available for
review in the virtual data room established by the Company and estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information. The Company
further acknowledges and agrees that it has relied solely on the
representations and warranties contained in Article III in determining to
enter into this Agreement and effectuate the Transactions, and it expressly
disclaims any reliance on any other representations or omissions of fact,
including, without limitation, any estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information.

 

(b) The indemnification rights provided in this Agreement constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of any party to this Agreement, or any Person claiming
by or through any party to this Agreement, for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligations contained in, or otherwise
pursuant to, this Agreement, other than (i) to the extent injunctive or
equitable remedies may apply or (ii) any amounts owed under

 



75

    

 Section 1.6. The parties to this Agreement expressly disclaim that they are
owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in
this Agreement, other than as expressly set forth in any Stockholder
Agreement, Letter of Transmittal, Option Waiver, Promised Options Release or
Non-Competition Agreement.

purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Where a reference is made to an act done or omitted to be done in
the "ordinary course of business consistent with past practice" of a Person,
such reference shall be understood to refer to an act or omission done in the
ordinary course of business of such Person and that is also consistent with
the past practice of such Person. Where a reference is made to a Contract,
instrument or Applicable Law, such reference is to such Contract, instrument
or Applicable Law as amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case
of Contracts or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of
Applicable Law) by succession of comparable successor Applicable Law and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires: (i) words of
any gender include each other gender and neutral forms of such words, (ii)

number, respectively, (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereto,"

in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other
thing extends and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." All references to

Day." Any action otherwise required to be taken on a day that is not a

9.4 _Company Disclosure Letter_. The representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in this Agreement are made and given subject to the
disclosures contained in the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company will not
be, nor will it deemed to be, in breach of any such representations and
warranties (and no claim will lie in respect thereof) in respect of any such
matter so disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that, each
disclosure, in order to be effective, shall clearly indicate the Section and,
if applicable, the Subsection to which it relates (unless and only to the
extent the relevance to other representations and warranties is readily
apparent from the actual text of the disclosure without any reference to
extrinsic documentation or any independent knowledge on the part of the reader
regarding the matter disclosed). Inclusion of information in the Company
Disclosure Letter will not be construed as an admission that such information
is material to the business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise)
of the Company, or as an admission of liability or obligation of the Company
to any third party matters set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be set forth in
the Company Disclosure Letter. Certain information set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter is included solely for informational purposes. The
inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter is not intended to
imply that such item is or is not required to be disclosed (including whether
such item is required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within
or outside the ordinary course of business, and no party will use the fact of
the inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described or included in the Company Disclosure Letter is or is not
required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or item is required to
be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or 

 



78

    

 outside the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The
disclosure of any matter in any parts of the Company Disclosure Letter is not
to be treated as constituting or implying any representation, warranty,
assurance or undertaking by the Company, nor to be treated as adding to or
extending the scope of any such partys representations or warranties in this
Agreement, in each case, except to the extent expressly set forth in this
Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company Disclosure Letter is
made a part of this Agreement as if set forth fully herein.

 

9.5 _Amendment_. Subject to Applicable Law, the parties hereto may amend this
Agreement by authorized action at any time pursuant to an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto; provided that after
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, no amendment shall be made to
this Agreement that by Applicable Law requires further approval by the
Company Stockholders without such further approval. To the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent may cause this
Agreement to be amended at any time after the Closing by execution of an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of Acquirer and the Securityholders
Agent

9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time at or prior to the Closing, any
party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto owed to such party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive any breaches of any of the
covenants, agreements, obligations or conditions for the benefit of such party
contained herein. At any time after the Closing, Acquirer and the
Securityholders Agent may, to the extent legally allowed, (A) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations of the other owed to such party,
(B) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (C)
waive any breaches of any of the covenants, agreements, obligations or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing that is
(I) prior to the Closing with respect to the Company and/or the Company
Securityholders, signed by the Company, (II) after the Closing with respect
to the Company Stockholders and/or the Securityholders Agent, signed by the
Securityholders Agent and (III) with respect to Acquirer and/or Merger Sub,
signed by Acquirer. Without limiting the generality or effect of the
preceding sentence, no failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right
under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no waiver of
any breach or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default
of the same or any other provision herein.

9.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; _it_
_being_ _understood_ _and_ _agreed_ that all parties hereto need not sign the
same counterpart. The delivery by electronic delivery in PDF format (including
any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000,
e.g., www.docusign.com) of this Agreement with all executed signature pages
(in counterparts or otherwise) shall be sufficient to bind the parties hereto
to the terms and conditions set forth herein. All of the counterparts will
together constitute one and the same instrument and each counterpart
will constitute an original of this Agreement.

9.8 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto, the
Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Letter, (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements, representations, warranties, statements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto and their
Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, and
shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its terms
and (b) are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as conferring,
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder
(other than the right of the Company Securityholders to receive consideration
hereunder and except as set forth in Section 5.16 and except that Article
VIII is intended to benefit the Indemnified Persons,

 



79

    

 Sections 9.16, 9.17 and 9.18 are intended to benefit the Designated Firm and
Section 9.19 is intended to benefit the Non-Parties).

 

9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and obligations
under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without
such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that
Acquirer and/or Merger Sub may assign its rights and delegate its obligations
under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Acquirer without the prior consent of any other party hereto; _provided_ that
notwithstanding any such assignment, Acquirer and/or Merger Sub, as
applicable, shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

9.10 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to replace such void
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

9.11  _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver by any party hereto of any
right to specific performance or injunctive relief. It is accordingly agreed
that, subject to Section 8.3(b), the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties
hereto hereby waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection
with the remedies described herein. Each party agrees that the rights of the
other parties to consummate the Transactions are special, unique and of
extraordinary character, and that if any party violates or fails or refuses to
perform any covenant or agreement made by it herein, the non-breaching parties
shall be without an adequate remedy at law. Each party agrees that it shall
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief on the basis that (a) the other party has an adequate remedy
at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or in equity. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall any partys right to seek specific performance pursuant to this Section
reduce, restrict or otherwise limit such partys right to terminate this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereby waives (i) any defenses in any action
for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (ii) any requirement under applicable legal requirements to post
a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

9.12 _Arbitration; Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of_
_Process_ _._

 

(a) EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS REGARDING UNPERMITTED DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION OR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE, TO WHICH THIS SECTION WILL NOT APPLY, IN
THE EVENT THAT A RESOLUTION IS NOT REACHED AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO WITHIN 60
DAYS AFTER WRITTEN NOTICE OF A DISPUTE, THE DISPUTE SHALL BE FINALLY SETTLED
BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK. SUCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE

ASSOCIATION BY ONE ARBITRATOR APPOINTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH RULES. THE
ARBITRATOR SHALL ALLOW SUCH DISCOVERY AS IS APPROPRIATE TO THE PURPOSES OF
ARBITRATION IN ACCOMPLISHING A FAIR, SPEEDY AND COST-EFFECTIVE RESOLUTION OF
THE DISPUTE. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL REFERENCE THE FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL
PROCEDURE

 



80

(b) Subject to the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the
Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
Delaware, the place where this Agreement was entered and is to be performed,
in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to herein, and in respect of the
Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any
action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or
thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any
such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or Federal
court. The parties hereto hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of
such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection
with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.2 or
in such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid and
sufficient service thereof. With respect to any particular action, suit or
proceeding, venue shall lie solely in Delaware. A party hereto may
apply either to a court of competent jurisdiction or to an arbitrator, if one

information. The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
return any inadvertently disclosed information to the disclosing party
