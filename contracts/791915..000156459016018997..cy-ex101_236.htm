Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters

 

. Unless otherwise expressly provided, for purposes of this Agreement, the
following rules of interpretation shall apply:

 



 

(a)Calculation of Time Period. When calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the starting reference date in
calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is
a non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding
Business Day.

 



 

(b)Gender and Number. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall include
all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall include the
plural and vice versa.

 



 

(c)Headings. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this
Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding Section of this Agreement
unless otherwise specified.

 



 

(d)Herein. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision
in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

 



 

-14-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

(e)Including. The word "including" or any variation thereof means "including,
without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any general statement
that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately
following it.

 



 

(f)Currency. All currency references included herein shall refer to United
States dollars.

 



 

(g)Reasonable Commercial Efforts. Reasonable commercial efforts means that
the obligated Party is required to make a diligent, reasonable and good faith
effort to accomplish the applicable objective. Such obligation, however, does
not require an expenditure of funds or the incurrence of a liability on the
part of the obligated Party unless the other Party agrees to refund the
obligated Party for such expenditure or assume such liability, nor does it
require that the obligated Party act in a manner that would be contrary to
normal commercial practices in order to accomplish the objective. The fact
that the objective is or is not actually accomplished is not, by itself, an
indication that the obligated Party did or did not in fact utilize its
reasonable commercial efforts in attempting to accomplish the objective. For
the avoidance of doubt, this Section 1.3(g) shall not affect, modify or alter
the obligations of the Parties with respect to matters relating to the use of
reasonable best efforts in respect of the Financing, including the Parties'
obligations pursuant to Section 5.15.

 



 

(h)Schedules and Exhibits. The Schedules and Exhibits attached to this
Agreement shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to
the same extent as if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. Any matter
disclosed by either Party on any one Schedule with respect to any
representation, warranty or covenant of such Party shall be deemed disclosed
for purposes of all other representations, warranties or covenants of such
Party to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from such disclosure that
it also relates to such other representations, warranties or covenants.

execution of such Sublease or to assign or transfer such previously
Nonassignable Asset to Buyer or the applicable Buyer Designee.

 



 

(d)Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use

Permits, certificates, approvals, authorizations or other rights or
obligations or liabilities that constitute Purchased Assets or Assumed
Liabilities or that are required to perform the obligations under the

Affiliates authorizes Buyer, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
terms of the Nonassignable Assets, at Buyer's expense, to perform all the
obligations and receive all the benefits of Seller or its Affiliates under the
Nonassignable Assets and appoints Buyer its attorney-in-fact to act in its

until any consent or approval with respect to any Nonassignable Asset is
obtained, such Nonassignable Asset shall not constitute a Purchased Asset and
any associated liability shall not constitute an Assumed Liability for any
purpose under this Agreement.

Designees pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Buyer or Buyer Designees and fifty percent (50%) by Seller or its Subsidiaries

to exempt the sale and transfer of the Purchased Assets from any such Transfer
Taxes. The Buyer (or the Buyer Designees) and Seller (or its Subsidiaries)

provided by Seller or a Subsidiary. Any other Value Added Taxes imposed on

that such Returns have been filed and Taxes have been paid, subject to such
Party's right to reimbursement from the other Party pursuant to this Section
2.8(c) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to minimize the amount of Transfer

applicable, shall present a statement to the other setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which each is entitled under this Section 2.8(d) together
with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the
proration amount. The proration amount shall be paid by the Party owing it to
the other within thirty (30) days after delivery of such statement. In the
event that Buyer or Seller makes any payment for which it is entitled to
reimbursement under this Section 2.8(d), the applicable Party shall make such
reimbursement promptly but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the
presentation of a statement setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which
the presenting Party is entitled along with such supporting evidence as is
reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of reimbursement.

requested for the purpose of enabling the requesting Party to (i) make any
election relating to Taxes, (ii) prepare Returns with respect to the IoT
Business or the Purchased Assets or (iii) to prepare for and defend audits or

negative, if negative, to the extent, and only to the extent, such amount
differs from the Base Inventory Value by more than five percent (5%) (such
difference in excess of five percent (5%) the "Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount"). If the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then
the Purchase Price shall be increased by the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount
and Buyer shall promptly (and in any event within seven (7) Business Days)
after the final determination thereof pay to Seller the Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Seller. If the Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount is a positive number, then the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the

has made available to Buyer true and complete copies of all Material
Contracts.

 



 

3.12Revenues; Absence of Certain Changes

 



 

(a)Schedule 3.12(a) sets forth a true and correct statement of revenues for
the IoT Business for each of the fiscal years ended November 1, 2015 and
November 2, 2014 and for the interim year-to-date period in 2016 up to March
31, 2016. The statement of revenues is derived from and has been prepared in
accordance with the books and records of Seller and the Subsidiaries (which
are accurate and complete in all material respects) on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered thereby consistent with GAAP (except for the
omission of footnotes and normal year-end adjustments and any potential
adjustments relating to the taxes and tax adjustments) and Seller's standard
accounting policies and procedures and (ii) presents fairly the revenues of
the IoT Business for such periods.

 



 

(b)The revenue of the IoT Business reflected on Schedule 3.12(a) has been
recognized in accordance with GAAP. The historical information relating to the

3.13Intellectual Property

 



 

(a)Seller or one of its Subsidiaries, each of which is incorporated or
otherwise organized and located in the United States, owns exclusively all
legal right, title and interest in and to the Assigned Intellectual Property,
free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. Seller
or one of its Subsidiaries owns or has a valid right to grant the licenses to
the Licensed Intellectual Property that it is licensing to Buyer pursuant to
the Intellectual Property Agreement. Seller and its Affiliates have not
received any notice or claim challenging Seller's or any of its Subsidiaries'
ownership of any Assigned Intellectual Property or suggesting that any other
Person has any claim of legal or beneficial ownership or exclusive rights with
respect thereto, nor to Seller's knowledge is there a reasonable basis for any
claim that Seller or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, does not so own any of
such Assigned Intellectual Property. Schedule A of Appendix F to the
Intellectual Property Agreement contains a complete and accurate list of all
registered Trademarks and pending applications for registration of Trademarks
that are primarily related to or primarily used in the operation or conduct of
the IoT Business or the Purchased Assets, including the distribution and sale
of the IoT Products (the "Assigned Trademarks" or "Assigned Registered IP"),
and there are no registered Copyrights and pending applications for
registration of

Copyrights owned by Seller or its Affiliates that are primarily related to or
primarily used in the operation or conduct of the IoT Business or the
Purchased Assets. To Seller's knowledge, there are no Patents primarily
related to the IoT Business that are not also used in Seller's retained
businesses. Seller has in its possession and will provide to Buyer at or prior
to Closing complete and accurate copies of all applications, material
correspondence with Governmental Bodies or registration organizations, and
other material documents related to each such item of Assigned Registered IP.
Schedule 3.13(a) sets forth a complete and accurate listing of the
jurisdiction in which each item of Assigned Registered IP has been registered
or filed, the applicable registration or serial number or similar identifier
and applicable issuance, registration or grant date, and all actions, filings
and payment obligations due to be made to any Governmental Body within one
hundred and eighty (180) days following the date hereof with respect to each
item of Assigned Registered IP. Other than communications with Governmental
Bodies or registration organizations regarding prosecution of the Assigned
Registered IP, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has received any
notice or claim challenging the validity or enforceability of any of the
Assigned Registered IP or indicating an intention on the part of any Person to
bring a claim that any of the Assigned Registered IP is invalid or
unenforceable, nor to Seller's knowledge is there a reasonable basis for any
claim that any of the Assigned Registered IP is either invalid or
unenforceable. All Assigned Registered IP has been registered or obtained in
accordance with all applicable legal requirements, and Seller has timely paid
all filing, examination, issuance, post registration and maintenance fees and
annuities associated with or required with respect thereto. None of the
Assigned Registered IP has been or is now involved in any interference,
reissue, reexamination, opposition, cancellation or similar proceeding and, to
Seller's knowledge, no such action is or has been threatened. Neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates has taken any action or failed to take any action
that would result in the abandonment, cancellation, forfeiture,
relinquishment, invalidation or unenforceability of any Assigned Registered
IP.

and its Affiliates have not disclosed, nor is Seller or any of its Affiliates
under any contractual or other obligation to disclose, to another Person any
IoT Trade Secrets, except pursuant to an enforceable confidentiality agreement
or undertaking, and, to Seller's knowledge, no Person has materially breached

Financing

 

. Buyer has delivered to Seller true, complete and fully executed copies of a

herewith (which fee

 

-43-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

letters may be redacted so long as no redaction covers terms that would
adversely affect the aggregate amount, conditionality, availability or
termination of the debt financing contemplated therein) and any related
exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, term sheets and other agreements,
which provide such lenders' respective commitments to provide Buyer with debt
financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby in the
amount set forth therein (the "Commitment Letter") (such debt financing, the
"Financing"). The Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Buyer and, to the knowledge of
Buyer, the other parties thereto, except insofar as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar Law affecting creditors' rights generally, or by principles governing
the availability of equitable remedies. As of the date hereof, the Commitment
Letter has not been amended or modified, and the respective commitments
contained in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, rescinded or
otherwise modified (and no such withdrawal, rescission or modification is
contemplated), other than to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities. As of the date hereof, there are no
side letters or other arrangements relating to the Commitment Letter that
could reasonably be expected to affect the availability of the funding in full
of the Financing at the Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer has
fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment fees or other
amounts that have been incurred and are due and required to be paid in
connection with the Commitment Letter on or prior to the date of this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Buyer or, to the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties
thereto under any term or condition of the Commitment Letter, or otherwise
result in any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable.
There is no condition precedent or other contingencies related to the funding
of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in the Commitment
Letter in the form so delivered to on or Seller prior to the date of this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer has no reason to believe
that any term or condition to the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letter
will not be fully satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing will not
be available to Buyer at the Closing.

 



 

Sufficiency of Funds

 

. At the Closing, upon receipt of the proceeds of the Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter, Buyer (i) will have sufficient funds available to
pay the Purchase Price and any expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements;
(ii) will have the resources and capabilities (financial or otherwise) to
perform its obligations hereunder and under the Collateral Agreements; and
(iii) will not have incurred any obligation, commitment, restriction or
liability of any kind, absolute or contingent, present or future, which would
impair or adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder
and under the Collateral Agreements. Buyer understands and acknowledges that
under the terms of this Agreement, including for purposes of Section 4.6 and
this Section 4.7, the obligations of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements are not in any way
contingent upon or otherwise subject to the consummation by Buyer of any
financing arrangements, the obtaining by Buyer of any financing or the
availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to Buyer.

 



 

No Other Representations or Warranties

 

. Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Article 4,
none of Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any other Person makes, and neither
Seller or any of its Affiliates is relying on, any representations or
warranties, and

Buyer hereby disclaims any other representations or warranties, whether made
by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, or any of their officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives, with respect to the execution and

contemplated hereby and thereby, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to
Seller or its representatives of any documentation or other information with
respect to any one or more of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth herein, the foregoing shall not apply in
the event of fraud or to any claims or rights of Seller, any Subsidiary, any
Affiliate of Seller or any other Person arising out of fraud.

commercial efforts to make alternative accommodations to afford access in a
manner that does not jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or legal or
contractual Third Party confidentiality obligation). Seller shall assist, and
cause its Subsidiaries to assist, Buyer and its Affiliates, and their
respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives, in making such investigation and shall cause its counsel,

Subsidiaries shall provide, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
provide, to each other and to their respective officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives, upon request (subject to any
limitations that are reasonably required to preserve any applicable attorney-
client privilege or legal or contractual Third Party confidentiality
obligation; provided, however, that in the event that access is limited or

5.3Tax Reporting and Allocation of Consideration

 



 

(a)Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that (i) Seller will be responsible
for and will perform all required Tax withholding, payment and reporting
duties with respect to any wages and other compensation paid by Seller or a
Subsidiary to any Business Employee in connection with the operation or
conduct of the IoT Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any Tax
withholding, payment and reporting related to payments made by Seller or a
Subsidiary to any Transferred Employee under a Benefit Plan of Seller or a
Subsidiary with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period, and (ii) Buyer will be
responsible for and will perform all required Tax withholding, payment and
reporting duties with respect to any wages and other compensation paid by
Buyer or a Buyer Designee to any Transferred Employee with respect any Post-
Closing Tax Period. After the Closing, Buyer and Seller agree to use the
alternate procedure set forth in Rev. Proc. 2004-053 with respect to the
Transferred Employees. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph
is intended to modify or adjust the substantive liability of Buyer and Seller
under this Agreement with respect to the Taxes described in this paragraph.

 



 

(b)Not later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Seller an allocation of the Purchase Price among the Purchased
Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local
or foreign law, as appropriate) (the "Asset Level Allocation Statement").
Seller and Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes relating to
the Asset Level Allocation Statement. If Seller and Buyer are unable to
resolve any such dispute, such dispute shall be resolved promptly by a
nationally recognized accounting firm acceptable to Buyer and Seller, the
costs of which shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. The Parties agree
that they will not, and will not permit any of their respective Affiliates to,
take a position (except as required pursuant to any order of a Governmental
Body) on any Return or in any audit or examination before any Governmental
Body that is in way inconsistent with the final Asset Level Allocation
Statement (the final Asset Level Allocation Statement being referred to herein
as the "Allocation"). If the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to Section
9.2(d), the Allocation shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with the
procedures set forth in this Section 5.3(b).

 



 

(c)Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing upon receipt by Seller of
notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to the
income, properties or operations of Seller that reasonably may be expected to
relate to or give rise to a lien on the Purchased Assets or the IoT Business.
Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly notify the other in writing upon
receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit or assessment
challenging the Allocation.

 



 

(d)Seller shall deliver to Buyer at the Closing a properly executed affidavit
prepared in accordance with Treasury Regulations section 1.1445-2(b)
certifying Seller's non-foreign status.

5.4Business Employees

 



 

(a)Prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer any updates to the
information provided in Schedule 3.10(a)(i) as of the day prior to the Closing
Date (the "Updated Employee List").

 



 

(b)Buyer or any Buyer Designee shall make offers of employment, contingent on
the Closing, to the Business Employees listed on Schedule 3.10(a)(i)
(including those absent due to vacation, holiday, illness, leave of absence or
short-term disability, but excluding any Business Employee on long-term
disability). Seller and any applicable Subsidiary shall cooperate and assist
in facilitating Buyer's or a Buyer Designee's offers and will not take any
action, or cause any of the Subsidiaries to take any action, which would
impede, hinder, interfere or otherwise compete with Buyer's or a Buyer
Designee's effort to hire any Business Employee. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Party shall comply with all applicable Laws in connection with
the transfer of the Business Employees to Buyer or a Buyer Designee, including
with respect to notice and other procedural requirements and Automatic
Transfer Laws. Seller and its applicable Subsidiaries will provide any and
all information reasonably required by Buyer or a Buyer's Designee in order
for Buyer to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement with respect to
Business Employees. The Parties will enter into appropriate documentation for
relevant jurisdictions outside the United States where necessary or
appropriate for the transfer of any Business Employees. Each Business
Employee who accepts Buyer's or a Buyer Designee's offer of employment, as of
the effective date of their employment with Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall be
referred to as a "Transferred Employee." Employment with Buyer or a Buyer
Designee of Transferred Employees shall be effective as of the Closing
Effective Time, except that the employment of individuals receiving short-term
disability benefits or on approved leave of absence on the Closing Date will
become effective as of the date they present themselves for work with Buyer or
a Buyer Designee or such other date as is prescribed by applicable Law.

 



 

(c)The Parties will comply with applicable Law regarding terms of employment
of Transferred Employees. Where terms are not dictated by applicable Law,
Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
Transferred Employees, at a minimum, the same base salaries or, as applicable,
base wage rates, offered by Seller or the applicable Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Closing Date as set forth on Schedule 3.10(a)(i). Buyer or a
Buyer Designee shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to Transferred
Employees employee benefits and new hire equity grants that are no less
favorable than those benefits and equity grants provided to similarly situated
employees of Buyer or the applicable Buyer Designee and shall structure offers
to Business Employees in any foreign jurisdiction so as not to trigger
termination or severance costs, if any. Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to recognize each Transferred Employee's service with
Seller or a Subsidiary prior to the Closing, including service with
predecessor employers that was recognized by Seller or a Subsidiary, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate or vesting in each employee
benefit plan, program, policy and arrangement of Buyer or a Buyer Designee,
including any vacation plans and severance plans, to the extent permitted by
such plans, programs, policies and arrangements, provided that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits.

 



 

-49-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

(d)Effective as of the Closing, Seller or the applicable Subsidiary will
terminate the employment of any Business Employee that is offered employment
in accordance with Sections 5.4(b) and 5.4(c) above and rejects such offer of
employment with Buyer or a Buyer Designee, including in connection with an
applicable objection under an Automatic Transfer Law. Seller or the
applicable Subsidiary will not pay such Business Employee any severance or
other similar benefit unless otherwise required by applicable Law or an
applicable Benefit Plan listed on Schedule 3.10(b), it being understood, for
the avoidance of doubt, that any such liabilities shall be Excluded
Liabilities hereunder.

 



 

(e)Other than as described on Schedule 5.4(e), Transferred Employees will not
be eligible for any severance benefits under the terms of any Benefit Plan of
Seller or any Subsidiary. Seller shall maintain and shall not amend the
transition incentive plan described on Schedule 5.4(e) for six (6) months
following the Closing and pay any and all amounts due thereunder.

 



 

(f)To the extent permitted under applicable Buyer benefit plans, (i) Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive any pre-existing condition
exclusion (to the extent such exclusion was waived under applicable health and
Welfare Plans offered to the Transferred Employees by Seller or a Subsidiary)
and proof of insurability, and (ii) the medical and dental plans maintained by
Buyer and any Affiliate of Buyer shall recognize as dependents of the
Transferred Employees the dependents recognized by Seller's or the applicable
Subsidiary's medical and dental plans.

 



 

(g)As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause one or
more defined contribution savings plans intended to qualify under sections
401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (the "Buyer Savings Plan") to provide for the
receipt of Transferred Employees' lump sum cash distributions, in the form of
an eligible rollover distribution from the Broadcom Corporation 401(k) Plan,
provided such rollovers are made at the election of the Transferred Employees
and in accordance with the terms of the Buyer Savings Plan. Seller shall
cause the Broadcom Corporation 401(k) Plan to fully vest Transferred Employees
in their accounts immediately prior to the Closing and permit the Transferred
Employees to elect a lump sum cash distribution of benefits accrued through
the Closing Date in accordance with the Code.

 



 

(h)The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to determine whether any
notification may be required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act or similar state or local law (the "WARN Act") as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller will be responsible
for providing any notification that may be required under the WARN Act with
respect to any of its employees. Buyer will be responsible for providing any
notification that may be required under the WARN Act with respect to any
Transferred Employees terminated after the Closing Date. In addition, Seller
shall, at its own expense, give all notices and other information required to
be given by Seller to the Business Employees pursuant to Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), in connection with
the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall be solely responsible for providing continuation
coverage under the COBRA.

 



 

-50-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

(i)If any Business Employee is employed in a jurisdiction in which there is an
Automatic Transfer Law, Buyer and Seller will mutually and reasonably
determine whether the Automatic Transfer Law applies to the transfer of the
Business Employee from Seller or its Subsidiaries to Buyer or its Designee.
Where the Parties determine that an Automatic Transfer Law applies to the
transfer of a Business Employee, each Party will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, comply with their respective obligations under the Automatic
Transfer Law. Seller and its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and Buyer and the
Buyers Designees on the other, will provide to the other such cooperation as
is reasonably necessary to permit the other to fulfill its obligations under
the Automatic Transfer Law. Any Business Employee who transfers to Buyer or
Buyer Designee pursuant to an Automatic Transfer Law will, for the avoidance
of doubt, be a Transferred Employee.

 



 

(j)To the extent to which a Transferred Employee would be in breach of any
obligation owed to Seller or one of its Affiliates solely by reason of
becoming employed by Buyer or a Buyer Designee (for example, a noncompete
obligation), Seller and its Affiliates will waive such obligation.

 



 

(k)Nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer or a Buyer Designee to employ
any Business Employees, or to employ any Transferred Employee on anything
other than an at-will basis, terminable at any time with or without cause,
except where prohibited under the local Law of any jurisdiction.

 



 

(l)Seller shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to assist Buyer with the
transfer of visas or work permits related to the Transferred Employees.

 



 

5.5Collateral Agreements

 



 

(a)On the Closing Date, Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall execute and deliver to
Seller, and Seller or the applicable Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to
Buyer or a Buyer Designee, the Collateral Agreements.

 



 

(b)Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith
the schedules for the services to be attached to the Transition Services
Agreement.

 



 

(c)Seller and Buyer shall share the costs of any work needed to separate the
leased or subleased Premises from the remainder of the Premises pursuant to a
plan approved by both Parties and provided that each Party will be solely
responsible for any costs due to its specialized needs.

 



 

(d)Between the date of this Agreement and a date that is at least ten (10)
days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Seller with written
instructions to enable Seller to place a purchase order with one or more of
its wafer manufacturing suppliers for delivery of wafers at or after the
Closing Date. Such purchases shall be made in accordance with the following
terms: (1) the aggregate value of the purchase order(s) shall not exceed $50
million; (2) upon the receipt of such wafers (in one or more deliveries),
Seller will immediately transfer them to Buyer and submit an invoice to Buyer;
(3) Buyer shall pay Seller the amount set forth in the purchase order(s)
within fifteen (15) days after receipt of each invoice; (4) pricing will be
the price the applicable wafer manufacturing supplier charges Seller - no
markup; and (5) to the extent allowed

 

-51-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

pursuant to its agreements with wafer manufacturing suppliers, Seller will
pass through warranty, indemnification, and similar protections, or will make
claims on behalf of Buyer; provided, however, that Seller shall not assume any
liability whatsoever in connection with any such claims or at all in
connection with this arrangement.

 



 

Leased Equipment

 

. Promptly after the date hereof, Seller shall provide Buyer with the costs
and other terms applicable to the Leased Equipment and Buyer shall decide (in
its sole discretion) whether such Leased Equipment will (a) transfer to Buyer
or a Buyer Designee as of the Closing Date by Buyer or a Buyer Designee
assuming the leases for such equipment, (b) become the property of Buyer or a
Buyer Designee as of the Closing Date by Buyer or a Buyer Designee paying for
the costs of purchasing such equipment pursuant to the leases (the "Purchased
Leased Equipment"), or (c) remain the property of Seller or a Subsidiary as of
the Closing Date (the "Excluded Leased Equipment").

 



 

5.7Regulatory Compliance

 



 

(a)Subject to Section 5.7(b), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable
commercial efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using reasonable commercial efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable; (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Bodies and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Bodies, if any); (iii) the obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from Third Parties; and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement and the Collateral Agreements. 

 



 

(b)Seller and Buyer shall timely and promptly make all filings (if any) which
may be required by each of them in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act and any other similar
applicable Law or by any other U.S., non-U.S. or multinational Governmental
Body, including in response to any request by any Governmental Body in
contemplation of a review of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the
Parties shall respectively use all reasonable commercial efforts to cause the
receipt of approval of, or prompt termination or expiration of the applicable
waiting period under such Laws. Seller and Buyer agree that their respective
initial filings (if any) under the HSR Act and in respect of any foreign
antitrust approval shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable following
the date of this Agreement, but in any event not later than fifteen (15)
calendar days following the date hereof. Each Party shall furnish to the other
such necessary information and assistance as the other Party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of any necessary filings or
submissions by it to any Governmental Body under applicable Law, including any
filings (if any) necessary under the provisions of the HSR Act. Each Party
shall provide the other Party the reasonable opportunity to make copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications (or memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) (if any) between such Party or its representatives, on the
one hand, and the

 

-52-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") or any state, foreign
or multinational Governmental Body or members of their respective staffs, on
the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each Party agrees to inform promptly the other Party of
any communication made by or on behalf of such Party to, or received by or on
behalf of such Party from, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other state,
foreign or multinational Governmental Body regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (i) neither Buyer nor Seller (or any Affiliates of Buyer or Seller)
shall be required to enter into any agreement that requires Buyer or Seller to
dispose of any portion of its businesses, operations, assets or product lines
other than the disposition that is contemplated in this Agreement; and (ii) it
is expressly understood and agreed that neither Buyer nor Seller (or any
Affiliates of Buyer or Seller) shall have any obligation to litigate any
judicial or administrative action or proceeding that may be brought in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and neither
Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall be required to agree to any license,
sale or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a
trust or otherwise), of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or
property of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, the IoT Business or the Purchased
Assets, or the imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of Buyer and
its Affiliates to conduct their businesses (including the IoT Business) or to
own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock (including the
Purchased Assets). 

 



 

5.8Contacts with Suppliers and Customers; Inventory

 



 

(a)In contemplation of the Closing, Seller shall permit Buyer to discuss and
meet, and shall reasonably cooperate in such discussions and meetings, with
any customer or supplier of the IoT Business that the Buyer so requests. A
representative of Seller or a Subsidiary shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to accompany the Buyer's representative to such meetings and to
participate with the Buyer's representative in any such discussions. In
addition, Seller and Buyer will prepare a communications plan for business
partners of the IoT Business, and agree on a plan to contact any suppliers to,
or customers of, the IoT Business in connection with or pertaining to any
subject matter of this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements and to
facilitate the transition of the IoT Business, including the preparation of
letters to all customers, suppliers, distributors and other business partners
of the IoT Business to notify them of the Closing and provide information
regarding the transition of the IoT Business to Buyer. Seller will be
responsible for contacting parties to any Transferred Contracts, Transferred
In-Licenses and Assigned Leases for which consent is required in connection
with their assignment pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, this Agreement shall not affect Seller's
continuing right to contact customers and suppliers in connection with the

those that are transferred pursuant to the Intellectual Property Agreement) in
all invoices, letterhead, advertising and promotional materials, office forms
or business cards;

 

(ii)Except as provided below, within six (6) months after the Closing Date,

that is in existence as of the Closing Date, nor shall Buyer nor Buyer
Designees be required at any time to remove such Seller Name and any such
other trademark, design or logo from schematics, plans, manuals, drawings,
machinery, datasheets, tooling including hand tools, and the like of the IoT
Business in existence as of the Closing Date to the extent that such
instrumentalities are used in the ordinary operation or conduct of the IoT
Business and are not broadly disseminated as advertisements to the public for
use as means to effectuate or enhance sales;

 



 

(iv)Buyer and Buyer Designees shall have the right to sell existing Inventory
and to use existing packaging, labeling, containers, supplies, advertising
materials, technical data sheets and any similar materials bearing the Seller
Name or any other trademark, design or logo previously or currently used by
Seller or any of its Affiliates until the earlier of (A) one year after the
Closing Date or (B) the depletion of existing Inventory;

 



 

(v)Buyer and Buyer Designees shall use Reasonable Efforts (as defined below)
to remove the Seller Name and any other trademark, design or logo previously
or currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than those that
are transferred pursuant to the Intellectual Property Agreement) from those
assets of the IoT Business (such as, but not limited to, tools, molds, and
machines) used in association with the IoT Products or otherwise reasonably
used in the operation or conduct of the IoT Business after the Closing. For
the purposes of this Section 5.9(a)(v), "Reasonable Efforts" means Buyer and
Buyer Designees shall remove the Seller Name from such assets but only at such
time when such asset is not operated or otherwise is taken out of

 

-54-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

service in the normal course of business due to regular maintenance or repair
(but only for such repairs or maintenance where such removal could normally be
undertaken, for example, repair or maintenance of a mold cavity) whichever
occurs first; provided that, in no event shall Buyer or any Buyer Designee use
the Seller Name after the date which is one (1) year from the Closing Date.
Buyer and Buyer Designees shall not be required to perform such removal on
such assets that are not or are no longer used to manufacture the IoT Products
or other parts, or if discontinuance of use of such assets is reasonably
anticipated during such time period, or from assets stored during that period
provided that such marks are removed upon such asset's return to service or
prior to their sale or other disposition; and

 



 

(vi)Seller hereby grants to Buyer and Buyer Designees a limited right to use
the Seller Name and associated trademarks, designs and logos as specified in,
and during the periods, if any, specified in clauses (i) - (v) above.

 



 

(vii)Buyer and its Affiliates shall also have the right to use (in a factual
manner that constitute fair use pursuant to applicable Law) the Seller Name
solely to the extent necessary to communicate that the IoT Products were
formerly owned by Seller.

 



 

(b)In no event shall Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer advertise or hold itself
out as Broadcom or an Affiliate of Broadcom after the Closing Date. 

 



 

Non-Solicitation or Hiring of Transferred Employees

 

. None of Seller, any of its representatives or any of its Affiliates will at
any time prior to the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the date
hereof, directly or indirectly, solicit the employment of, hire or employ any
Transferred Employee without Buyer's prior written consent. The term "solicit
the employment" shall not be deemed to include generalized searches for
employees through media advertisements, employment firms or otherwise that are
not focused on or directed to Transferred Employees. This restriction set
forth in this Section 5.10 shall not apply to any Transferred Employee whose
employment was involuntarily terminated other than for cause by Buyer, a Buyer
Designee, or their respective successors or assigns, after the Closing.

 



 

No Negotiation or Solicitation

 

. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates will not (and Seller
will cause each of its employees, officers, representatives and agents or
advisors not to and shall cause its Affiliates to cause employees, officers,
representatives and agents or advisors not to) directly or indirectly (a)
solicit, initiate, entertain, encourage or accept the submission of any
proposal, offer or any discussions relating to or that might reasonably be
expected to lead to or result in any proposal or offer from any Person
relating to the direct or indirect acquisition of the IoT Business or any
portion of the Purchased Assets (other than purchases of IoT Products or
services from the IoT Business in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice), or (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding the IoT Business, furnish any information with respect thereto, or
assist or participate in, or facilitate or encourage in any other manner any
effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. Seller
will notify Buyer if any Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact
with respect to any of the foregoing promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) after receipt of any such offer or proposal, including the
identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact and all
material terms thereof.

5.12Non-Competition

 



 

(a)Seller agrees that, as part of the consideration for the payment of the
Purchase Price, for a period of thirty-six (36) months immediately following
the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will, directly or
indirectly, as a principal, stockholder, joint venturer or otherwise, (i)
operate, perform or have any ownership interest in any business that designs,
develops, manufactures, markets, sells, installs or distributes products in
competition with the IoT Business or (ii) except in connection with patent
cross-licenses and other patent licenses entered into by Seller or an
Affiliate in connection with patent licensing activities, sales of products or
settlement of litigation, in each case in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, Seller shall not knowingly grant any license to
the Licensed Intellectual Property for the purpose of enabling a third party
to compete with the IoT Business, except that Seller may purchase or otherwise
acquire by merger, purchase of assets, stock (including investing as a
minority shareholder), controlling interest or otherwise any Person or
business or engage in any similar merger and acquisition activity with any
Person the primary business of which is not in competition with the IoT
Business. For the purposes of this Section 5.12(a), ownership of securities
of a company whose securities are publicly traded under a recognized
securities exchange not in excess of ten percent (10%) of any class of such
securities shall not be considered to be competition with the IoT Business,
and a Person shall not be considered to be in the "primary business" of
competing with the IoT Business if such Person derives less than twenty
percent (20%) of its revenues from products that compete with the IoT
Business. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the agreements
and limitations set forth in this Section 5.12 shall not apply to any entity
that acquires all or part of Seller or any of its Affiliates in any
transaction or to Seller's purchase of any microcontroller company.

 



 

(b)Seller acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in Section 5.12(a)
constitute a material inducement to Buyer's entering into and performing this
Agreement. Seller further acknowledges, stipulates and agrees that a breach of
such obligation could result in irreparable harm and continuing damage to
Buyer for which there may be no adequate remedy at Law and further agrees that
in the event of any breach of said obligation, Buyer may be entitled to
injunctive relief and to such other relief as is proper under the
circumstances.

 



 

(c)If any provision contained in this Section shall for any reason be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section
5.12, but this Section 5.12 shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention
of the Parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein
is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not
permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any
extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of
no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable
under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and
interpret or reform this Section 5.12 to provide for a covenant having the
maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not
greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under
such applicable Law.

Post-Closing Remittances

 

. If on or after the Closing Date, either Party receives a payment from a
Third Party (including a customer of the IoT Business) that, pursuant to the
terms hereof, should have been paid to the other Party, the Party who receives
the payment agrees to hold in trust and remit such payment to the Party
entitled thereto within five (5) Business Days of such receipt.

 



 

5.14Prorations and Adjustments

 



 

(a)Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all ordinary course expenses
for (i) rents and other charges or amounts payable included in the Purchased
Assets and transferred to Buyer hereunder and (ii) gas, electricity, water,
sewer, rent and telephone charges at the Leased Premises, in each case, for
the period prior to the Closing Date, will be for the account of Seller and
for the period on and after the Closing Date shall be for the account of
Buyer. If any Party actually makes any payments that are, in whole or in
part, designated as payments for the period allocated to the other Party under
this Section 5.14, such other Party shall promptly reimburse such amounts to
the Party so making such payments.

 



 

(b)For purposes of calculating prorations, Buyer shall be deemed to own the
Purchased Assets, and, therefore be responsible for the expense thereof, as of
12:01 a.m. local time on the day after the Closing Date. All prorations shall
be made on the basis of the actual number of days of the month that shall have
elapsed as of the Closing Date and based upon a 365-day year. The amount of
the prorations shall be subject to adjustment after the Closing, as and when
complete and accurate information becomes available, and the Parties agree to
cooperate and use their good faith efforts to make such adjustments.

 



 

5.15Financing

 



 

(a)Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to
arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Financing (including, to the extent
required, the full exercise of any flex provisions) at or prior to the
Closing, including using its reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in
effect the Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, (ii) comply with its obligations under the Commitment
Letter, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter or on
such other terms and conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to Buyer
(as determined by Buyer in its reasonable discretion) than the terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Letter, which in no event shall include
such other terms or conditions that would adversely impact or delay in any
material respect the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing, (iv) satisfy, or cause its
Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis, all conditions applicable to
Buyer or its Representatives in the Commitment Letter (or definitive
agreements entered into with respect to the Commitment Letter), it being
understood that Buyer may seek to obtain financing in a private placement of
securities pursuant to available exemptions from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or in a
public offering of securities pursuant to the Securities Act in lieu of all or
a portion of the Financing (and references to the Financing in this Section
5.15(a) shall be deemed to include such private placement or public offering,
as applicable); provided, however, that (1) Buyer shall not release or

 

-57-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

waive the Commitment Letter or the obligations of the arrangers and lenders
thereunder and (2) Buyer shall proceed with, and consummate, the financing
contemplated in the Commitment Letter in the event that such alternative
private placement financing or public offering financing is not available or
would delay or hinder the Closing in any material respect, (v) prepare the
information memoranda, preliminary and final offering memoranda or
prospectuses, registration statements and other materials to be used in
connection with obtaining the Financing prior to the anticipated date on which
all of the conditions in Section 8.2 have been satisfied, to the extent
reasonably practicable, and (vi) in the event that all conditions in the
Commitment Letter have been satisfied, cause the lenders and any other Persons
providing financing to fund the Financing at the Closing.

 



 

(b)Without limiting the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer
will not permit any amendment, restatement, substitution, replacement,
supplement or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy pursuant to, the Commitment Letter if such amendment, restatement,
substitution, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver would (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Financing below an amount that is necessary to
consummate the purchase of the Purchased Assets, (ii) impose new or additional
conditions or other terms to the Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing, in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or impede in any material respect
the consummation of the purchase of the Purchased Assets, or (B) make the
funding of the Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing, less likely to occur in any material respect, or (iii)
materially adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto, provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may amend
the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of
the date hereof. Buyer shall furnish Seller complete, correct and executed
copies of any amendments or modifications to the Commitment Letter. Buyer
shall consult with and keep Seller reasonably informed of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Financing. Buyer shall give Seller prompt notice of
any breach or written repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter of
which Buyer or its Affiliates become aware.

 



 

(c)If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including the flex
provisions) and such portion is required to consummate the purchase of the
Purchased Assets or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Collateral Agreements, (A) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of such
event and the circumstances relating thereto and (B) Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain any such portion from
alternative sources as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event on terms, taken as whole, that are no more adverse to Buyer
(including after giving effect to the flex provisions) following the
occurrence of such event. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section
5.15(c), the Commitment Letter may be amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified or superseded at the option of Buyer after the date of this
Agreement bur prior to the Closing by instruments that either amend, amend and
restate, or replace the existing Commitment Letter or contemplate co-
investment by or financing from one or more additional parties; provided that
the terms of such new or amended commitment letters shall not (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing that is necessary to consummate the purchase
of the Purchased Assets, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other
terms to the Financing, or otherwise expand any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Financing, in a manner

 

-58-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

that would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or materially impede the
consummation of the purchase of the Purchased Assets, or (B) make the funding
of the Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing, less likely to occur in any material respect, or (iii) materially
adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other
parties of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements with respect
thereto. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of its intention to make any such
amendment or obtain such alternative financing and keep Seller reasonably
informed of the terms thereof. Buyer shall deliver to Seller true and correct
copies of all new or amended commitment letters (including redacted fee
letters in respect of any new or amended commitment letters). In such event,
the term "Commitment Letter" as used herein shall be deemed to include the
Commitment Letter that are not so superseded at the time in question and the
new or amended commitment letters to the extent then in effect and the term
"Financing" as used herein shall be deemed to include the financing
contemplated by any such new or amended commitment letters. 

 



 

(d)Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and will cause its
Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts to, cooperate with Buyer at
its reasonable request in its efforts to consummate the Financing. Such
reasonable commercial efforts shall include, without limitation, to the extent
reasonably requested by Buyer, (i) participation by senior management of the
IoT Business in a reasonable number of meetings with prospective lenders,
investors and other Debt Financing Sources related to the Financing, (ii)
providing reasonable assistance in preparation of customary information
memoranda, preliminary and final offering memoranda or prospectuses,
registration statements and other materials to be used in connection with
obtaining such Financing, (iii) reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts of Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources for the Financing, including
participation in a reasonable number of management presentation sessions, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions, "road shows" and sessions with rating
agencies, (iv) providing reasonable assistance in obtaining any consents of
third parties necessary in connection with such Financing, including any
necessary accountants' consents and customary "comfort" letters with respect
to such Financing, (v) providing assistance in releasing Liens on the
Purchased Assets to take effect at the Closing, and (vi) cooperating with
respect to matters relating to pledges of collateral to take effect at the
Closing in connection with such Financing. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be
required in connection with the Financing to (i) pay any commitment or other
similar fee or enter into any definitive agreement or incur any other
liability or obligation in connection with the Financing (or any alternative
financing), (ii) take any action that would conflict with or violate Seller's
or such Affiliate's organizational documents or any applicable Laws or result
in the contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a
violation or breach of or default under, any Contract to which Seller or any
of its Affiliates is a party, (iii) take any action that would cause any
director, officer or employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates to incur any
personal liability, or (iv) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations
of Seller or its Affiliates. Buyer shall reimburse Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives for any reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket expenses and costs incurred in connection with Seller's or its
Affiliates' obligations under this Section 5.15(d) promptly upon presentment
of invoices therefor. Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the "5.15(d) Indemnitees") shall be indemnified
and held harmless by Buyer from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses (including advancing attorneys' fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation), interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or

 

-59-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

incurred by the 5.15(d) Indemnitees in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing (or any alternative financing) and/or any information provided by
Seller or any of its Affiliates for use in connection therewith, except to the
extent such losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments or penalties arose out of or resulted from the willful misconduct or
gross negligence of any 5.15(d) Indemnitee. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, it is understood and agreed that the condition precedent set
forth in Section 8.2(b), as applied to Seller's and its Affiliates'
obligations under this Section 5.15(d), shall be deemed to be satisfied unless
the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter has not been obtained as a
direct result of Seller's willful and material breach of its obligations under
this Section 5.15(d). 

 

(e)All non-public or other confidential information provided by or on behalf
of Seller, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives pursuant
to this Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Buyer will be permitted to disclose
such information (i) as is legally required to be disclosed in any offering
documents related to the Financing or (ii) to any financing sources or
prospective financing sources, ratings agencies and other financial
institutions and investors that are or may become parties to the Financing and
to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in connection with
the Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so
long as such Persons (x) agree in writing to be bound by the Confidentiality
Agreement as if parties thereto, or (y) are subject to other confidentiality
undertakings customary for financings of the same type as the Financing.

 



 

(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller, on
behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, directors, officers and employees
and solely in its capacity as a party to this Agreement, hereby waives any
rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source, solely in its capacity as
a Debt Financing Source, in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether under law or
equity (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect of any oral or
written representations made or alleged to be made in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby and Seller (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, directors,
officers and employees) agrees not to commence any action or proceeding
against any Debt Financing Source, solely in its capacity as a Debt Financing
Source, in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether under law or equity, and
agrees to cause any such action or proceeding asserted by Seller (on behalf of
itself and any of its Affiliates, directors or officers, employees) in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby to be dismissed or otherwise terminated. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged
and agreed that no Debt Financing Source, solely in its capacity as a Debt
Financing Source, shall have any liability for any claims or damages to Seller
in connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Letter, the Financing, or
the financing agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
The provisions of this Section 5.15(f) shall inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, each Debt Financing Source, its Affiliates and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which is hereby intended
to be an express third party beneficiary of this Section 5.15(f).

 



 

(g)Buyer agrees to pay the costs, fees and expenses incurred by Buyer or its
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated pursuant to this
Agreement and the Collateral Agreements and the Financing, including, without
limitation, any legal, tax, accounting, and other advisory, broker, finder or

in connection therewith and the preparation of this Agreement and related
documents and (b) all analyses, reports, compilations, evaluations and other
materials prepared by Buyer or its counsel, accountants or financial advisors
to the extent that they contain or otherwise reflect or are based upon, in
whole or in part, any of the provided information; provided, however, that
subject to Section 6.2(a), the Confidentiality Agreement shall be of no
further force and effect with respect to information of Seller or its
Affiliates the ownership of which is transferred to Buyer or a Buyer Designee
at the Closing.

 



 

6.2Seller's Proprietary Information

 



 

(a)Except as provided in Section 6.2(b) and as may be permitted by the

from, or made available by, Seller in the course of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and marked or identified at the time of disclosure as the

written interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas,
civil investigative demands or other similar processes) to disclose Seller
Proprietary Information, Buyer (or its Affiliate) may disclose only so much of
Seller Proprietary Information to the Third Party compelling disclosure as is
so required; and such Seller Proprietary Information shall retain its

documents, subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other similar legal
processes) to disclose any Buyer Proprietary Information to a Third Party,
Seller will promptly notify Buyer of such request or requirement and will
cooperate with Buyer, at Buyer's cost and expense, in any Buyer efforts to
seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy to prevent or
limit the disclosure of such Buyer Proprietary Information. If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller (or

thereof is required under accounting, stock exchange or federal securities or
labor relations Laws regarding disclosure obligations or pursuant to legal
process (such as oral or written interrogatories, requests for information or
documents, subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other similar legal
processes), both Parties agree that the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Collateral Agreements and all Schedules, attachments and

that is more restrictive than the limitation contained in this Article 6, then
the limitation in such agreement shall supersede this Article 6.

-66-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

representations or warranties, and neither Buyer nor Seller may bring any
indemnification claims arising out of any breaches of or inaccuracies in such

such Indemnified Party shall have made in good faith and with reasonable
specificity before the Expiration Date in accordance with this Article 9, in
which case such claim or right to indemnification shall survive indefinitely
until such claim has been finally resolved.

 



 

9.2General Agreement to Indemnify

 



 

(a)Each of Seller and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
other Party hereto, and Affiliates thereof, and any director, officer,
employee or agent of such other Party or Affiliates thereof (each an
"Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims, actions, suits,
proceedings, liabilities, obligations, losses, and damages, amounts paid in
settlement, interest, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees, court costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating,
preparing or defending the foregoing) (collectively, "Losses") paid,
sustained, incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Party to the extent that
the Losses arise by reason of, or result from, (i) subject to Section 9.1, any
breach of or any failure of any representation or warranty of such Party
contained in this Agreement to have been true when made or to be true at and
as of the Closing Date; or (ii) to the extent not expressly waived by the
other Party in writing, the breach by such Party of any covenant or agreement
of such Party contained in this Agreement. 

 



 

(b)Seller further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and Affiliates
thereof, and any director, officer, employee or agent of Buyer or Affiliates
thereof (each a "Buyer Indemnified Party") from and against any Losses paid,
sustained, incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of,
resulting from, or relating to: (i) the Excluded Liabilities; (ii) Buyer's
waiver of, or noncompliance with, any applicable Bulk Sales Laws and (iii) any
claim, demand or liability for Taxes relating to, pertaining to, or arising
out of the IoT Business or the Purchased Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

 



 

(c)Buyer further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and Affiliates
thereof, and any director, officer, employee or agent of Seller or Affiliates
thereof (each a "Seller Indemnified Party") from and against any Losses paid,
sustained, incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Party arising out
of, resulting from, or relating to: (i) any failure of Buyer to discharge any
of the Assumed Liabilities, and (ii) any claim, demand or liability for Taxes
relating to, pertaining to, or arising out of the IoT Business or the
Purchased Assets for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(d)Amounts payable in respect of the Parties' indemnification obligations
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and
shall be treated as such by Buyer and Seller on their Returns to the extent
permitted by law. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party (as defined below)
chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim (as defined below), both
Parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall
furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery

 

-67-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith or as provided in Section 5.1.

 



 

(e)The amount of the Indemnifying Party's liability under this Agreement shall
be net of any applicable insurance proceeds (net of the costs of recovery
thereof and any premium increases resulting therefrom) actually received by
the Indemnified Party that actually reduce the overall impact of the Losses
upon the Indemnified Party (it being understood, however, that the Indemnified
Party shall have no obligation to seek or procure any such insurance proceeds,
whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or applicable Law). 

 



 

(f)The Indemnifying Party's liability for all claims made under Section 9.2(a)
(i) shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall have no liability for such claims until the aggregate amount of the
Losses incurred shall exceed $2,750,000 (the "Threshold Amount") in which case
the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the portion of the
indemnifiable Losses exceeding the Threshold Amount and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party's aggregate liability for all such claims shall not exceed $55,000,000
(the "Cap Amount").

 



 

(g)The Indemnified Party may not make a claim for indemnification under
Section 9.2(a)(i) after the Expiration Date ; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, so long as such Indemnified
Party shall have made an indemnification claim in good faith and with
reasonable specificity before the Expiration Date in accordance with this
Article 9, then such claim or right to indemnification shall survive
indefinitely until such claim has been finally resolved.

 



 

(h)The indemnification provided in this Article 9 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy after the Closing Date for damages available to the Parties
to this Agreement for breach of any of the terms, conditions, covenants,
representations or warranties contained herein or any right, claim or action
arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (but not claims
arising under any Collateral Agreement); provided, however, this exclusive
remedy for damages does not preclude a Party from bringing any action (or, in
the case of clause (ii), limit the amounts recoverable in any action) for (i)
specific performance or other equitable remedy to require a Party to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement or (ii) fraud
or intentional misrepresentation.

 



 

(i)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the proviso of this Section 9.2(h)), no Party shall be liable to
the other Party or any other Indemnified Party for any indirect, special,
punitive (unless paid to a Third Party), exemplary or consequential loss or
damage pursuant to arising out of an indemnification claim made under this
Agreement.

 



 

(j)Both Parties shall mitigate their damages for which they may seek
indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that neither the foregoing nor
anything else in this Agreement will be construed to expand or extend a
Party's common law obligation to mitigate damages to the extent required by
common law.

 



 

-68-

 

Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductor Confidential  

(k)The rights to indemnification under this Section 9.2 shall not be subject
to set-off for any claim by the Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified
Party, whether or not arising from the same event giving rise to such
Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification.

 



 

9.3Third Party Claims

 



 

(a)The Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under this Agreement shall
promptly notify the Party against whom indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of
any action, suit or proceeding by any Third Party (a "Third Party Claim"), in
respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and shall give the
Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying
Party may reasonably request, but failure to give such notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered material prejudice by such
failure). The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within
twenty (20) days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the
commencement of or assertion of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense
and control the settlement of any such Third Party Claim if and only if (i)
the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party for any and all damages, losses and liabilities arising out
of such Third Party Claim, (ii) such Third Party Claim involves (and continues
to involve) claims solely for money damages and/or involves (and continues to
involve) claims for both money damages and equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party that cannot be severed, where, in the reasonable good faith
opinion of Buyer, the claims for money damages are the primary claims asserted
by the Third Party and the claims for equitable relief are incidental to the
claims for money damages. In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises
its right to control the defense of any Third Party Claim as provided above,
then the other Party shall cooperate in such defense and make available all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in such Party's
possession and control relating thereto as is reasonably required to by the
Indemnifying Party conducting the defense.

 



 

(b)The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall
have the right to participate in (but not control), at its own expense, the
defense of any Third Party Claim that the other is defending, as provided in
this Agreement.

 



 

(c)If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any Third Party Claim
as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle,
consent to a settlement of, or consent to the entry of any judgment arising
from, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnified Party's prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) unless (i) such settlement or judgment relates solely to monetary
damages for which the Indemnified Party has acknowledged and accepted full
responsibility to indemnify the Indemnified Party, and (ii) the terms of the
settlement include a full and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party
and all of its Affiliates in respect of the subject matter of such Third Party
Claim and all related claims and damages arising therefrom. The Indemnifying
Party shall not, without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent, enter
into any compromise or settlement that (i) commits the Indemnified Party to
take, or to forbear to take, any action, or (ii) does not provide for a full
and unconditional release by such Third Party of the Indemnified Party.

Indemnification Claim Procedures Generally

 

. In the event an Indemnified Party shall claim a right to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall send written notice
of such indemnification claim to the Indemnifying Party; provided, however,
that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of any liability hereunder (unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party has suffered material prejudice by such failure). Such notice shall
specify the basis for such claim, the amount thereof, if known, and the method
of computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity and shall contain a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such a claim
shall be incurred. Such notice shall be given as promptly as is reasonably
practicable after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the basis for each
such a claim. The Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice of an indemnified Loss, and subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 9.2, (i) pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified Party
the amount of such Loss specified in such notice which the Indemnifying Party
does not contest, or (ii) notify the Indemnified Party if it wishes to contest
the existence or amount of part or all of such a Loss by stating with
particularity the basis upon which it contests the existence or amount
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party so contests such existence or amount of
part or all of such a Loss the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall
work in good faith to resolve any dispute in respect of such Loss for a period
of thirty (30) days, after which either the Indemnified Party or Indemnifying
Party may submit such dispute to any court of competent jurisdiction.

relating to this Agreement, the Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including any dispute arising out of or

a mutually agreeable release announcing the transaction contemplated hereby.
Except for such press release, neither Seller nor Buyer shall, without the
approval of the other, make any press release or other announcement concerning

by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such Party shall be so
obligated by Law, in which case the other Party shall be advised and the
Parties shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to cause a mutually

their Boards of Directors or by their duly authorized officers or employees,
whether before or after such Party's action. Any term or condition hereof may
be waived and at any time prior to the Closing Date by the Party hereto which
is entitled to the benefits thereof by action taken by its Board of Directors
or its duly authorized officer or employee, whether before or after the action
of such Party. Any such amendment or waiver shall be evidenced by a written
instrument duly executed on behalf of each Party by its duly authorized
officer or employee. The failure of either Party to enforce at any time any
provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such
provision nor shall it in any way affect the validity of this Agreement or the
right of such Party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No
waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any amendment or modification of Section 5.15(f), Section 10.5,
Section 10.6(b), Section 10.7, Section 10.10, or this Section 11.3 that is
materially adverse to the Debt Financing Sources under the financing
