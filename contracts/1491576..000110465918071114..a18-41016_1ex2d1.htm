beneficially owned by them to Purchaser in the Offer.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) (i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and provided
that (x) this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE
VIII_ and (y) the Company is prepared (in accordance with _Section 1.2_) to
file the Schedule 14D-9 on the same date as Purchaser commences the Offer,
Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in no
event later than the tenth (10th) day on which the principal offices of the
SEC in Washington, D.C. are open to accept filings or, in the case of
determining a date when any payment is due, any day (other than Saturday or
Sunday) on which banks are open in New York, New York (any such day, a "
_Business Day_ ") following the date hereof), commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer at the Offer Price. The obligation of Purchaser
to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer is subject only to the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of those conditions set forth in
_Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Unless extended in accordance with
_Section 1.1(a)(ii)_, the Offer will expire at one (1) minute after 11:59
p.m. Eastern Time on the twentieth (20th) Business Day (calculated as set
forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following (and including the
day of) the commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or,
if the Offer has been extended in accordance with _Section 1.1(a)(ii)_, at
the time and date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial
Expiration Date, and/or such later time and date to which the Offer has been
extended in accordance with _Section 1.1(a)(ii)_, the " _Expiration Date_ ").
Purchaser expressly reserves the right at any time or from time to time, in
its sole discretion, to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or

forth on _Annex I_ , (E) modify the conditions set forth on _Annex I_ in a
manner adverse to the holders of Shares, (F) extend the Expiration Date of the

to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) by Purchaser
of the Offer Conditions as of any scheduled Expiration Date, Purchaser shall
accept for purchase and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, as promptly as practicable after such
scheduled Expiration Date (the date and time of acceptance for payment, the "
_Acceptance Time_ "). Purchaser shall not permit holders of Shares to tender
Shares in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures. Purchaser
shall (A) extend the Offer for one (1) or more periods of time of up to ten
(10) Business Days (or for such longer period as may be agreed to by Parent
and the Company) per extension if, at any scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer
Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) is not satisfied and has
not been waived (to the extent permitted hereunder) and (B) extend the Offer
for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), the staff thereof, or
The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _Nasdaq"_ ) applicable to the Offer; _provided_
that Purchaser is not required to, and Purchaser shall not, under any
circumstances, without the prior written consent of the Company, extend the
Offer beyond the Outside Date. In addition, if, at the otherwise scheduled
Expiration Date, each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender
Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived and the Minimum Tender
Condition shall not have been satisfied, Purchaser shall extend the Offer for
two (2) consecutive increments of not less than ten (10) Business Days each
(or for such shorter period as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be permitted to extend the
Offer pursuant to this sentence on more than two (2) occasions; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to, and Purchaser shall not,
under any circumstances, without the prior written consent of the Company,
extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

 



 

(iii) The Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to
register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by Purchaser
effective immediately after the Acceptance Time.

in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
Laws. The Company shall furnish promptly to Parent and Purchaser all

prior to their filing with the SEC. Except from and after a Change of Board
Recommendation, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) promptly provide the Company
and its counsel

     

 

 



 

with a copy of any written comments (and a description of any oral comments)
received by Parent, Purchaser or their counsel from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents, (ii) consult with the Company regarding any
such comments prior to responding thereto and (iii) promptly provide the
Company with copies of any responses to any such comments. Parent and
Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that it has become aware that such information has become false
or misleading in any material respect, and include any information the absence
of which renders the included information misleading in any material respect.
Parent and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws.

basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_, Purchaser shall terminate the Offer
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_), and Purchaser shall not
acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated by
Purchaser, or if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_
prior to the acquisition of Shares in the Offer, Purchaser shall promptly (and
in any event within two (2) Business Days of such termination) return, and
shall cause any depositary or other agent acting on behalf of Purchaser to
return, in accordance with applicable federal securities Laws, all Shares
tendered into the Offer to the registered holders thereof.

 



 

(e) The (i) Offer Price and (ii) Merger Consideration will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange, or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution occurring (or for which
a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to (A) the
payment by Purchaser for Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in
connection with the Offer (with respect to the Offer Price) or (B) the
Effective Time (with respect to the Merger Consideration); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this sentence shall not be construed to permit the Company to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.2. _Company Actions; Schedule 14D-9_. As promptly as practicable
after the filing of the Offer Documents on the date such documents are filed,
but not before the tenth (10th) Business Day after the date hereof without the
Companys consent, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") containing,
subject to _Section 6.3_, the Company Board Recommendation. At the time the
Company first files the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC, the Company shall include
in the Schedule 14D-9 the information required by

     

 

 



 

Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL such that the Schedule 14D-9 constitutes a
notice of appraisal rights under Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company
shall establish the Stockholder List Date as the record date for the purpose
of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL; _provided_
that such record date will not be more than ten (10) calendar days prior to
the date that the Schedule 14D-9 is first mailed. The Company hereby consents
to the inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents
and, absent a Change of Board Recommendation, to the inclusion of a copy of
the Schedule 14D-9 with the Offer Documents mailed or furnished to the holders
of Shares. Parent and Purchaser shall, absent a Change of Board
Recommendation, disseminate a copy of the Schedule 14D-9 with the Offer
Documents mailed or furnished to the holders of Shares. Parent and Purchaser

respect to any amendments filed in connection with or after a Change of Board

the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, (ii) consult with
Parent and Purchaser regarding any such comments prior to responding thereto
and (iii) promptly provide Parent and Purchaser with copies of any responses
to any such comments, in each case, except with respect to comments in

with or after any disclosures made in compliance with _Section 6.3_. Each of
the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it has
become aware that such information has become false or misleading in any
material respect, and include any information the absence of which renders the
included information misleading in any material respect. The Company shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws.

 



 

Section 1.3. _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the Company
shall cause its transfer agent to promptly furnish Parent and Purchaser with
mailing labels, security position listings and computer files containing the
names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of the most recent
practicable date preceding the date on which the Offer is commenced (such
date, the " _Stockholder List Date_ "), and the Company shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to Parent and Purchaser such information and assistance
(including periodic updates of such information and all other information in
the Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of the
Shares as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser) as Parent or
Purchaser or their agents may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the Shares.
Except for such actions as are reasonably necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents, each of Parent and Purchaser shall hold and use all information and
documents provided to it under this _Section 1.3_ in accordance with the
letter agreement regarding confidentiality, by and between Parent and the
Company, dated August 8, 2018, as amended on August 18, 2018 (the "

as described in _Section 3.3_.

 



 

Section 3.2. _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) The Company Board (or, if appropriate, a committee administering a

     

 

 



 

Company equity incentive plan, inducement award program or other similar plan,
program or arrangement under which equity awards or equity-based rights are
outstanding (the " _Company Equity Plans_ " and each such plan or program, a "
_Company Equity Plan_ ")) has adopted, or, as soon as practicable following
the date hereof (and, in any event, prior to the Effective Time), shall adopt,
resolutions providing that, as of the Effective Time:

 



 

(i) each option to acquire Shares, other than awards under the Companys 2012
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") (each such option, a " _Company
Stock Option_ "), and each other equity award or right measured by the value
of Shares (or pursuant to which Shares may be delivered) (including deferred
units or similar rights or awards of non-employee directors), other than
awards under the ESPP (collectively, " _Company Equity Awards_ "), that is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in
full at the Effective Time;

 



 

(ii) each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that has an exercise price per Share that is less than the
Merger Consideration shall be cancelled, without any action on the part of the
holder of such Company Stock Option, and, in exchange therefor, the former
holder of such cancelled Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive
(without interest), in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Stock
Option, an amount in cash (less applicable tax withholdings pursuant to
_Section 3.6_) equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject
to the unexercised portion of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (determined after giving effect to the accelerated vesting
described in _Section 3.2(a)(i)_ above) multiplied by (y) the excess, if any,
of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per Share under
such Company Stock Option;

 



 

(iii) each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that has an exercise price per Share that is greater than or
equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time,
without any action on the part of the holder of such Company Stock Option, and
the holder of such Company Stock Option shall not be entitled to receive any
payment in exchange for such cancellation; and

 



 

(iv) each Company Equity Award, other than a Company Stock Option, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled, and
the former holder of such cancelled Company Equity Award shall be entitled, in
exchange therefor, to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less
applicable tax withholdings pursuant to _Section 3.6_) equal to the product
of (x) the total number of Shares subject to (or deliverable under) such
Company Equity Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined after
giving effect to the accelerated vesting described in _Section 3.2(a)(i)_
above) multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 3.6_, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
make all payments to former holders of Company Equity Awards required under
_Section 3.2(a)_ as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in
any event, no later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, in
accordance with the foregoing and the terms of the applicable Company Equity
Plans pursuant to which such Company Equity Awards were issued.

     

 

 



 

(c) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall take
all actions with respect to the ESPP that are necessary to provide that (i)
with respect to the Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) in effect on the
date hereof (" _Current Purchase Period_ "), no individual may enroll in the
ESPP after the date hereof with respect to such Current Purchase Period and no
participant may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction
election from that in effect on the date hereof for such Current Purchase
Period and (ii) no new offering period shall be commenced under the ESPP
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. If the Effective Time
is expected to occur prior to the end of the Current Purchase Period, the
Company shall take action to provide for an earlier exercise date (including
for purposes of determining the Purchase Price (as defined in the ESPP) for
the Current Purchase Period) (such earlier date, the " _Early ESPP Exercise
Date_ "). The Early ESPP Exercise Date shall be as close to the Effective Time
as is administratively practicable. The Company shall suspend the commencement
of any future Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) unless and until this
Agreement is terminated and shall terminate the ESPP as of the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 3.3. _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not
be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 3.1(a)_, but instead, at the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares will
no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to
exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto except the right to payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ that
if any such holder fails to perfect, or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses
his, her or its right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect
to such Dissenting Shares or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL,
then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of his, her or its
Dissenting Shares will cease, and such Dissenting Shares will be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, the Merger Consideration as of the Effective Time as provided in
_Section 3.1(a)_.

 



 

(b) The Company shall provide Parent with prompt written notice of any written
demands for appraisal (including copies of such written demands), withdrawals
of such demands, and any other instruments received by the Company from
holders of Shares relating to rights of appraisal, and Parent shall have the
opportunity and right to direct the conduct of all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. Except with the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for appraisal.

 



 

Section 3.4. _Payment of the Merger Consideration; Surrender of Shares_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with a bank or trust company selected by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Offer Price (calculated for purposes of this
_Section 3.4(a)_ assuming that all outstanding Shares are tendered

     

 

 



 

into the Offer), and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to timely make all
payments contemplated in _Section 3.4(b)_. Such cash may be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ (i) that such investments must
be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities
of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America
and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, (ii) no such
investment will relieve Parent, Purchaser, or the Paying Agent from making the
payments required by this _ARTICLE III_ and (iii) no such investment will
have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to
this Agreement. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. No loss
incurred with respect to such investments will decrease the amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that the amount of cash held by the
Paying Agent is insufficient to pay the aggregate Offer Price and Merger
Consideration, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional
funds with the Paying Agent to ensure the prompt payment of the Offer Price
and Merger Consideration. The cash as so deposited with the Paying Agent will
not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section
3.4(b)_, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. Any portion of
the cash made available to the Paying Agent in respect of any Dissenting
Shares will be returned to Parent.

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ") or a book-entry share (" _Book-Entry Share_ "), which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that
were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificate to the
Paying Agent and customary provisions regarding delivery of an "agents
message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares) and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and properly completed, or "agents message", as
applicable, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration as provided
in _Section 3.1(a)_ for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered
will be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.4(b)_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(a)_ and will not evidence any
interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other
equity holder of, the Company or the Surviving Corporation. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share.

 



 

(c) At any time following the date that is six (6) months after the Effective
Time, Parent may require the Paying Agent to deliver to Parent any funds
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that have been made
available to the Paying Agent and that have

      

 

 



 

not been disbursed to holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, and
thereafter such holders will be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat, or other similar Laws) with respect
to the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered
immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any Merger Consideration in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by

Except as (i) other than with respect to _Section 4.3_ and _Section 4.4_, as
disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
filed by the Company with, or furnished by the Company to, the SEC after
December 31, 2017, and publicly available at least one (1) Business Day prior
to the date hereof (the " _Filed Company SEC Documents_ ") (but excluding in
the case of this clause _(i)_ any risk factor disclosure under the heading
"Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements" or other similar non-specific or
non-precise cautionary, predictive or forward-looking disclosures contained in
such Filed Company SEC Documents) to the extent the qualifying nature of such
disclosure with respect to a specific representation and warranty is
reasonably apparent on its face or (ii) set forth in the corresponding section
of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent and Purchaser
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ ") ( _provided_ , _however_ , that a matter disclosed in any section
or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter will also be deemed to qualify
or apply to each other section or subsection with respect to each other
section or subsection to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face
that such disclosure also qualifies or applies or relates to such other
sections or subsections), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Purchaser as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1. _Organization and Qualification_. Each of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity validly existing under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization and is in good standing (to the extent
that such concept is recognized in the relevant jurisdiction) under the Laws
of its respective jurisdiction of organization, with all corporate or similar
power and authority necessary to own its properties and conduct its business
as currently conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified and in good standing as a foreign entity authorized to do business
in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or held
under lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially delay, or would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay, the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Material
Adverse Effect_ " means any change, event, condition, development,
circumstance, state of facts, effect or occurrence or combination of the
foregoing that,

     

 

 



 

individually or in the aggregate with any other change, event, condition,
development, circumstance, state of facts, effect or occurrence has, had or
would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, condition (financial or otherwise), assets, liabilities, properties,
operations, or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that any changes, events,
conditions, developments, circumstances, state of facts, effects or
occurrences resulting from or arising from any of the following will not be
deemed to constitute a Material Adverse Effect and will be disregarded in
determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred: (i) matters
generally affecting the U.S. or foreign economies, financial or securities
markets, or political, legislative, or regulatory conditions, or the industry
in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, except to the extent such
matters have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the impact on other companies
in the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate; (ii) the
announcement of the execution or pendency of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) any change in the market price or
trading volume of the Shares; _provided_ that this exception will not preclude
a determination that a matter underlying such change has resulted in or
contributed to a Material Adverse Effect and such underlying matter shall not
be disregarded in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred;
(iv) changes after the date hereof in global, national or regional political
conditions (including the outbreak of war or terrorism (or the escalation of
the foregoing)), except to the extent such matters have a materially
disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, relative to the impact on other companies in the industry in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries operate; (v) changes after the date hereof in
Laws, regulations, or accounting principles, or interpretations thereof,
except to the extent such changes have a materially disproportionate adverse
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the
impact on other companies in the industry in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate; (vi) the performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including compliance with covenants set
forth herein, or any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (excluding the requirement that the Company use reasonable
efforts to operate in the ordinary course of business) at the request or with
the prior written consent of Parent or Purchaser prior to the taking or the
omission of such action; (vii) the initiation or settlement of any legal
proceedings commenced by or involving any current or former holder of Shares
(on their own or on behalf of the Company) arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; (viii) except for any
changes, events, conditions, developments, circumstances, state of facts,
effects or occurrences that would reasonably be expected to result in (1) the
withdrawal of ZEJULA from any public market or (2) a clinical hold or
termination of any Company sponsored clinical trial for a Company Product,
which shall not be disregarded in determining whether a Material Adverse
Effect has occurred, (A) any decision by a Company Regulatory Agency with
respect to any currently pending regulatory application or filing with respect
to any Company Product; (B) any decision or action by any Company Regulatory
Agency or other payor with respect to the pricing and/or reimbursement of any
currently marketed Company Product; (C) any delay in any ongoing clinical
trial or any delay by the Company in making any currently planned application
for marketing approval with respect to any Company Product, to the extent such
delay would not reasonably be expected to exceed six (6) months; (D) any
changes in the approved labeling of any product that is a competitor to a
Company Product or any legal action taken with respect to any product that is
a competitor to a Company Product; (E) the results of

     

 

 



 

any inspection of the Company, its properties or assets, by any Company
Regulatory Agency, including any observations, Form 483s or similar
correspondence or notice with respect thereto, unless such inspection would
reasonably be expected to result in remedial action in excess of $500,000,000;
and (F) any audit opinion that expresses substantial doubt about the Companys
ability to continue as a going concern during the following twelve months,
(ix) matters listed on the Company Disclosure Letter or in the SEC Reports; or
(x) any failure by the Company to meet any internal or analyst projections or
forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings, or other financial metrics for
any period; _provided_ that this exception will not preclude a determination
that a matter underlying such failure has resulted in or contributed to a
Material Adverse Effect and such underlying matter shall not be disregarded in
determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Companys

or prevent or materially delay, or would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay, the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Merger do not and will not require any
consent, approval, authorization, waiting period expiration or termination, or
permit of, action by, filing with, or notification to, any federal, state,
local, municipal, or other government, governmental agency, or body entitled
to exercise governmental administrative, executive, judicial, or legislative

Section 4.6. _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis all
forms, reports, schedules, statements, exhibits, certifications, and other
documents (including all

     

 

 



 

exhibits, amendments, and supplements thereto) required to be filed or
furnished by it with the SEC on a timely basis since January 1, 2016, (i)
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ ") and (ii)
pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act (collectively, and in
each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein, as such statements and reports may have
been amended since the date of their filing, the " _SEC Reports_ "). As of
their respective dates, each of the SEC Reports complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ")
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the
date so filed, except to the extent amended or superseded by a subsequent
filing with the SEC made prior to the date hereof. Except to the extent
amended or superseded by a subsequent filing with the SEC made prior to the
date hereof, as of their respective dates (and if so amended or superseded,
then on the date of such subsequent filing), none of the SEC Reports contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. No executive officer of the Company has
failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under
Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. There are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in any comment letters of the staff of the SEC relating to

the date hereof, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in all material
respects and fairly present in all material respects in conformity with GAAP
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated statements of operations and
consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited Financial Statements, to normal and
recurring year-end audit adjustments and condensed notes as permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC or other rules and regulations of the SEC). The books and
records of the Company have been, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements. No Financial Statements of any Person other than the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries are required by GAAP to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company. Ernst and Young LLP has not
resigned (or informed the Company that it intends to resign) or been dismissed
as an independent public accountant of the Company as a result of, or in
connection with, any disagreements with the Company on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
implemented and maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as required by

     

 

 



 

Rule 13a-15(a) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of consolidated financial statements for external purposes. The Company has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as required by
Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act) that (i) are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the timeframes specified by the SECs rules and forms and (ii)
are effective in all material respects to perform the functions for which they
were established. From the date of the filing of the Companys Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, to the date hereof,
the Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of its system
of internal control over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, to the
Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board, (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses known to it in the design
or operation of its internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize, and
report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether material or not, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and other
rules and regulations of Nasdaq.

 



 

(d) To the actual knowledge of the individuals listed on _Section 4.6(d)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter (and the knowledge that such individuals would
have obtained in the normal and ordinary course of the performance of their
duties) (the " _Knowledge of the Company_ "), no employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries has provided, from January 1, 2015, information to any law
enforcement agency regarding the violation by the Company or its Subsidiaries
of any applicable Law of the type described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have discharged, demoted,
or suspended since January 1, 2015 an employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries because of any lawful act of such employee described in Section
806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



 

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership, or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose, or limited purpose entity
or Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the
result, purpose, or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys published
financial statements or other SEC Reports.

 



 

(f) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has any liabilities of a nature

complete and correct list of each material "employee benefit plan" as defined
in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ERISA_ ") (whether or not subject to ERISA), and any other plan,
policy or program providing material compensation or other material benefits
to any employee or director (or to any dependent or beneficiary thereof) of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which is maintained, sponsored, or
contributed to (or required to be contributed to) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for which the Company has or would reasonably be expected to
have any direct or indirect liability, including all material pension,
retirement, profit sharing, incentive, bonus, deferred compensation,
perquisite, medical, hospitalization, insurance, disability, stock purchase,
stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, restricted stock, restricted
stock unit, stock-based compensation, change-in-control, retention or
severance plans, policies or programs (each, a " _Company Plan_ "). For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Foreign Benefit Plans_ " shall mean
those Company Plans maintained, sponsored or contributed to (or required to be
contributed to) primarily for the benefit of employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries who are or were regularly employed outside the United

by applicable foreign Law to be so maintained, sponsored or contributed to).
For purposes of this _Section 4.13_, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " shall mean any
entity (whether or not incorporated) that is required to be treated as a
single employer with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Sections
414(b) or (c) of the Code.

 



 

(b) With respect to each Company Plan that is not a Foreign Benefit Plan, the
Company has made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of the
following (as applicable): (i) the written plan document, including any
amendment thereto (or, with respect to any unwritten Company Plan, a written
description of the material terms thereof); (ii) the current summary plan
description and any material modifications thereto, if any, or any written
summary provided to participants with respect to any Company Plan for which no
summary plan description exists; (iii) the most recent determination, opinion
or advisory letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "); and (iv)

arrangements.

 



 

(c) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Company Plan
has been administered in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, (ii)
the Company has made all timely contribution (or, if not yet due, proper
financial reporting) of any amounts required to be made under the terms of any
of the Company Plans, and (iii) from January 1, 2015 through the date hereof,
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, there are no audits or investigations by any
Governmental Entity with respect to, or other actions, claims, suits, or other
proceedings against or involving any Company Plan or asserting rights or
claims to benefits under any Company Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits payable in the normal course). Each Company Plan that is intended to
be "qualified" under Section 401 of the Code has received or is covered by a
favorable determination, opinion or advisory letter from the IRS to such
effect and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred since the
date of such letter that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified of any such Company Plan (or the tax-exempt status of any related
trust). Except as required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, no Company Plan
provides benefits or coverage in the nature of health or life insurance
following retirement or other termination of employment.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), whether alone or in conjunction with any other event (including any
termination of employment), will, except as otherwise provided by this
Agreement, (i) entitle any current or former director, officer, employee or
individual service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
material compensation or benefit or any material increase in the amount of any
compensation or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
trigger any payment or funding, of any compensation or benefit or trigger any
other obligation under any Company Plan or (iii) result in the payment or
provision of any amount (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) to any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Company Plan that would
reasonably be expected to result in a "parachute payment" and not deductible
by reason of Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse
any individual for any excise taxes, interest or penalties incurred pursuant
to Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code has been operated

inspection, or to disclose any information, that (i) in the reasonable
judgment of the Company would violate any of its or its Affiliates respective
obligations with respect to confidentiality, or (ii) the Company determines in
good faith after consulting with counsel that affording such access or
furnishing such information would result in a violation of applicable Law or
result in loss of legal protection, including the attorney-client privilege
and work product doctrine; _provided_ that the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any required consents for the disclosure of such
information and take such other reasonable action (including entering into a
joint defense agreement or similar arrangement to avoid loss of attorney-
client privilege) with respect to such information as is necessary to permit
disclosure to Parent.

(a) The Company shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall
instruct its Representatives not to: (i) directly or indirectly initiate,
solicit, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of

Person (other than Parent, Purchaser, or any designees of Parent or Purchaser)
in a manner that is intended to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or in
connection with or in response to any inquiry, offer or proposal that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct

     

 

 



 

its Representatives to, (x) immediately cease any solicitation, discussions,
or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser, or any

provided by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to any such Person
within the last eighteen (18) months for the purposes of evaluating a possible

provisions of this _Section 6.3_, the Company and its Representatives may in
any event (A) seek to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any

breach of this _Section 6.3_ solely to determine whether such inquiry or
proposal constitutes an Acquisition Proposal and (B) inform a Person that has
made an Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this _Section 6.3_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.3(a)_ or any other
provision of this Agreement, if at any time following the date hereof and
prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company has received a written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 6.3_ and (ii) the Company Board or a committee thereof determines,
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and a financial

Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives and (B) engage in, enter into or participate in discussions or
negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that (x) the Company shall not, and shall
instruct its Representatives not to, disclose any non-public information to
such Person unless the Company has, or first enters into, a confidentiality
agreement with such Person on terms that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (y) the Company promptly
provides or makes available to Parent any non-public information concerning
the Company or its Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other
Person that was not previously provided or made available to Parent;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may only take the actions described

determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take any such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. The Company shall not, and shall cause its
Representatives not to, release any Person from, or waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under or fail to enforce, any standstill
provision in any agreement to which the Company is a party; _provided_ that,
if the Company Board or a committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Company may waive any such standstill provision to the extent necessary to
permit the applicable Person (if such Person has not been solicited in
material breach of this _Section 6.3_) to make, on a confidential basis to
the Company Board, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such Person
agreeing that the Company shall not be prohibited from providing any
information to Parent (including regarding any such Acquisition Proposal) in
accordance with, and otherwise complying with, this _Section 6.3_.

     

 

 



 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day
after receipt thereof) notify Parent of (i) the receipt by the Company of an
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal (including a copy of such Acquisition Proposal (redacted
for any identifying information that the Company is obligated to keep
confidential under a confidentiality agreement in effect prior to the date
hereof) or, where such Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a description
of the terms thereof). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
prompt basis, as to the status of such Acquisition Proposal, including by
promptly (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day after receipt)
providing to Parent copies of any correspondence, proposals, indications of
interest, and/or draft agreements (including material schedules, exhibits and
any other written materials related thereto (including any financing
commitments received), which may be redacted to the extent necessary to
protect confidential information of the Person making such Acquisition

terms and conditions of this Agreement, (i) propose publicly to approve or
recommend, or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement relating to or that would reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with _Section 6.3(b)_) (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), or publicly propose to take any such
action or (ii) (A) publicly withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Purchaser, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation, (B)
propose publicly to adopt, endorse, approve or recommend, an Acquisition
Proposal, (C) publicly make any recommendation in connection with a tender

the Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to the Companys stockholders, (E) fail
to recommend against an Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or exchange
offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) of such tender or exchange offer or (F) fail to publically
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days of
receiving a written request from Parent to provide such public reaffirmation
following receipt by the Company of a publicly announced Acquisition Proposal
( _provided_ that Parent may deliver only one (1) such request with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal) (any action described in this clause _(ii)_ being
referred to herein as a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ ").

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 6.3(d)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, prior to the Acceptance Time:

      

 

 



 

(i) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ (so long as, prior to, and
as a condition to the effectiveness of, such termination, the Company pays to
Parent the termination fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_) if (A) the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material
breach of this _Section 6.3_, and the Company Board or a committee thereof
determines in good faith that it constitutes a Superior Proposal; (B) the
Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to terminate this
Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement; (C) the Company
shall have negotiated, and shall have instructed its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith, with Parent during the Notice Period, to the extent
Parent requests to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms of this
Agreement in such a manner that would cause such Superior Proposal to no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and (D) no earlier than the end of the
Notice Period, the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good
faith, after taking into consideration the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to this Agreement that Parent has irrevocably committed to make
during the Notice Period, that the Acquisition Proposal that is subject of the
Determination Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal;

 



 

(ii) the Company Board or a committee thereof may make a Change of Board
Recommendation if (A) the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from a material breach of this _Section 6.3_, and the Company
Board or a committee thereof determines in good faith constitutes a Superior
Proposal; (B) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to
effect a Change of Board Recommendation; (C) the Company shall have
negotiated, and shall have instructed its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith, with Parent during the Notice Period, to the extent Parent
requests to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement
in such a manner that would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal; and (D) no earlier than the end of the Notice
Period, the Company Board or a committee thereof determines in good faith that
the failure to make a Change of Board Recommendation would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
after taking into consideration any changes to this Agreement that Parent has
irrevocably committed to make during the Notice Period; and

 



 

(iii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
or a committee thereof may make a Change of Board Recommendation in response
to an Intervening Event if (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that
it intends to effect a Change of Board Recommendation; (B) the Company shall
have negotiated, and shall have instructed its Representatives to negotiate,
in good faith, with Parent during the Notice Period, to the extent Parent
requests to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement
in such a manner that would eliminate the need for taking such action; and (C)
no earlier than the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board or any
committee thereof determines in good faith, after considering the terms of any
proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement that Parent has
irrevocably committed to make during the Notice Period, that the failure to
effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 



 

The provisions of this _Section 6.3(e)_ apply to any change to the financial
terms or any other material terms of any applicable Superior Proposal with
respect to clause _(i)_ and _(ii)_ and require

     

 

 



 

a revised Determination Notice and a new Notice Period pursuant to clause
_(i)(D)_ or _(ii)(D)_ , as the case may be.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement prohibits the Company Board or a
committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the holders of Shares a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if required
under the Exchange Act or if the Company Board or a committee thereof
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to make such statement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ that this clause (f) shall not be construed
to exclude such communications from the definition of "Change of Board
Recommendation."

(ii) " _beneficial owner_ " with respect to any Shares has the meaning
ascribed to such term under Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act (and the term
"beneficially owned" or "owns beneficially" has a corresponding meaning).

 



 

(iii) " _Determination Notice_ " means any notice delivered by the Company to
Parent pursuant to _Section 6.3(e)(i)(B)_, _Section 6.3(e)(ii)(B)_ or
_Section 6.3(e)(iii)(A)_ and which notice will include a description of the

a whole, that (A) was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board
as of the date hereof, (B) does not relate to the receipt of, or progress
towards, approvals that have been applied for prior to the date hereof for any
Company Product and (C) does not relate to or constitute an Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry related thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that any change
in the price or trading volume of the Shares shall not be taken into account
for purposes of determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred (it
being understood, however, that any underlying cause thereof may be taken into
account for purposes of determining whether an Intervening Event has
occurred).

 



 

(v) " _Notice Period_ " means the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time
on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of a Determination Notice (in
the event that such Determination Notice is delivered after 5:00 p.m. Eastern
Time, the period shall be deemed to begin at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the
next Business Day) and ending on the fourth

     

 

 



 

(4th) Business Day thereafter at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time; _provided_ that with
respect to any change in the financial terms or any other material terms of an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, deliver to Parent an
additional Determination Notice and the Notice Period will begin at 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of a
Determination Notice (in the event that such Determination Notice is delivered
after 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the period shall be deemed to begin at 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on the next Business Day) and ending on the second (2nd) Business
Day thereafter and the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of _Section 6.3(e)_ anew with respect to such additional
Determination Notice; _provided_ , _further_ , that if fewer than five (5)

Date.

 



 

(vi) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a material breach of this _Section 6.3_ (A) that if consummated
would result in a third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such
third party and the Company, the stockholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding
Company Common Stock or more than fifty percent (50%) of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) that is not subject to any
due diligence investigation, (C) the Company Board determines in good faith is
reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed and (D) that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, taking into account
the timing and likelihood of consummation relative to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and after giving effect to any changes to this
Agreement irrevocably proposed by Parent in response to such Acquisition
Proposal and all other financial, legal, regulatory, Tax and other aspects of
such proposal, including all conditions contained therein and the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal, as the Company Board deems relevant (taking
into account any changes to this Agreement irrevocably proposed by Parent in
response to such Acquisition Proposal), is more favorable from a financial
point of view to the stockholders of the Company than the Offer.

 



 

Section 6.4. _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
other Subsidiaries to, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending December 31, 2019, maintain for each individual employed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (each, a " _Current Employee_
") (i) each of base compensation and a target annual cash incentive
compensation opportunity at least as favorable as that provided to the Current
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) benefits that are
at least as favorable as the benefits maintained for and provided to the
Current Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii)
severance benefits that are at least as favorable as the severance benefits
provided by the Company to the Current Employees as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time to the extent set forth in Section 4.13(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service
rendered by Current Employees to the Company and its Subsidiaries, prior to
the Effective Time to be taken into account for all purposes under employee
benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving

     

 

 



 

Corporation, and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service was
taken into account under the corresponding Company Plans immediately prior to
the Effective Time for those purposes; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits or the funding thereof with respect to the same period of service.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to not, subject Current Employees to any
eligibility requirements, waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements or
pre-existing condition limitations under any employee benefit plan of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any condition for which they
would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Company Plan in
which they participated prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to give such Current
Employees credit under such employee benefit plans for any eligible expenses
incurred by such Current Employees and their covered dependents under a
Company Plan during the portion of the year prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of satisfying all co-payment, co-insurance, deductibles, maximum out-
of-pocket requirements, and other out-of-pocket expenses applicable to such
Current Employees and their covered dependents in respect of the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply
to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits
or the funding thereof with respect to the same period of service.

 



 

(c) No provision of this Agreement (i) prohibits Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating any individual Company Plan or any
other employee benefit plan, (ii) confers upon any director, Current Employee
or service provider of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof any

Parent or any Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof for any period of time, or
shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to discharge or
terminate the services of any director, employee or individual service
provider of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof at any time for
any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, or (iii) constitutes the
establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any Company Plan or employee
benefit plan. No Current Employee or any other individual employed by, or
providing services to, the Company or its Subsidiaries has any third-party
beneficiary or other rights with respect to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.5. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporations certificate
of incorporation and bylaws to contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation from
liabilities of present and former directors, officers, and employees of the
Company than are currently provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, which provisions may not be amended, repealed, or otherwise modified
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations applicable to such matters and (ii) six (6) years from the
Effective Time, and in the event that any Proceeding is pending or asserted or
any claim made during such period, until the disposition of any such
Proceeding or claim, unless such amendment, modification, or repeal is
required by applicable Law, in which case Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, make such changes to the certificate of
incorporation and the bylaws as to have the least adverse effect on the rights
of the individuals referenced in this _Section 6.5_.

     

 

 



 

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
agreement or Company Plan, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) or former
director or officer of the Company (each, together with such Persons heirs,
executors, or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), against all
obligations to pay a judgment, settlement, or penalty, and reasonable fees and
expenses incurred in connection with any Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, arbitrative, or investigative, and whether formal or informal,
arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission, including any action
or omission in connection with the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was
an officer, director, employee, fiduciary, or agent of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or of another entity if such service was at the request of the
Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the Effective
Time. In the event of any such Proceeding, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
advance to each Indemnified Party reasonable expenses incurred in the defense
of the Proceeding ( _provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced
shall have provided, to the extent required by the DGCL, an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is finally determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
may purchase prior to the Effective Time, and if the Company does not purchase
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase at or
after the Effective Time, a "tail" policy under the current directors and
officers liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), which tail
policy (i) will be effective for a period from the Effective Time through and
including the date six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at
the Effective Time and (ii) will contain coverage that is at least as
protective to such directors and officers as the coverage provided by such
existing policies; _provided_ that the premium for such tail policy may not be
in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained
in full force and effect for their full term, and cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) Without limiting any of the rights or obligations under this _Section
6.5_, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years following the
date hereof, and shall comply with the terms and conditions of, any agreement
in effect as of the date hereof between or among the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party providing for the indemnification of
such Indemnified Party and that has been made available to Parent or filed
with the SEC.

 



 

(e) This _Section 6.5_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to benefit, and is enforceable by, any Person or entity referred to
in this _Section 6.5_. The indemnification and advancement provided for in
this _Section 6.5_ is not exclusive of any other rights to which the
Indemnified Party is entitled whether pursuant to Law, Contract, or otherwise.
If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity resulting from such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or a majority of its properties and

     

 

 



 

assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall make proper
provisions such that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation
assume the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section 6.5_.

 



 

Section 6.6. _Further Action; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the
Effective Time, each Party shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by or before the
Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parties agree to, or to cause their ultimate parent entity (as such term is
defined in the HSR Act) to, (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and all other filings required
pursuant to applicable foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger as
promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the expiration of
any applicable legal deadline ( _provided_ that the filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act must be made within ten (10) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement), and (ii) to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable
Antitrust Law. Parent shall, with the prompt reasonable cooperation of the
Company, be responsible for making any filing or notification required or
advisable under the German and Austrian Antitrust Laws within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the date hereof, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company
and Parent in writing. The Parties shall also consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with, and provide to the other Parties in advance, any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions, and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of such Party in connection with proceedings under
or relating to any Antitrust Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties
agree (A) to give each other reasonable advance notice of all substantive
meetings with any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws
applicable to the Offer and the Merger, (B) unless prohibited by applicable
Law or by a Governmental Entity, to give each other an opportunity to
participate in each of such meetings or calls, (C) to the extent practicable,
to give each other reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral
communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws

applicable to the Offer and the Merger, to promptly notify the other Party of
the substance of such communication, (E) to provide each other with a
reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon all written
communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions, and proposals) with a Governmental Entity regarding any
Antitrust Laws applicable to the Offer and the Merger, and (F) to provide each
other with copies of all written communications to or from any Governmental
Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws applicable to the Offer and the Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties shall be permitted to redact any
materials (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company,
(y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or applicable Law,
and (z) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client privilege concerns;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any such disclosures or provision of copies by
one Party to the other may be made on an outside counsel only basis, if
appropriate. Parent, after prior consultation with the Company, shall have the
principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for

     

 

 



 

obtaining any necessary clearances under the Antitrust Laws and shall take the
lead in all meetings and communications with any Governmental Entity in
connection therewith.

 



 

(b) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts to, take any
and all actions necessary to obtain any consents, clearances, or approvals
required under or in connection with the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended,
the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and
any other federal, state or foreign law, regulation, or decree designed to
prohibit, restrict, or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or significant impediment of effective
competition (collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ ") to enable all waiting periods
under applicable Antitrust Laws to expire, and to avoid or eliminate
impediments under applicable Antitrust Laws asserted by any Governmental
Entity, in each case, to cause the Merger to occur prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding this _Section 6.6(b)_ or
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not have any
obligation to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the
Company to) offer, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, (1) the sale, divestiture, license, or other
disposition of any and all of the capital stock, assets, equity holdings,
rights, products, or businesses of the Parent and its Subsidiaries (including
the Company, Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries), or (2)
any other restrictions on the activities of Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Company, Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries), other than, in each case, to the extent necessary to obtain the
required approvals or clearances under the applicable Antitrust Laws required
to consummate the Merger, such actions that would not, and would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially and
adversely affect the business of the Company, Surviving Corporation and their
respective Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall require any party to
take or agree to take any action with respect to its business or operations in
connection with obtaining required approval or clearance under any applicable
Antitrust Laws unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon the Closing.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the obligations in clauses _(a)_ and _(b)_ of this
_Section 6.6_, in the event that any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental
Entity challenging the Offer or the Merger, each of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction, decision, or other order, whether temporary, preliminary, or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts
consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any consents, approvals, or waivers of third parties with
respect to any Contracts to which it or a Subsidiary of the Company is a party
as may be necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by

execution, performance, or consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ that in no event will the Company or its
Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee,
penalty, or other consideration or make any other accommodation to any third
party to obtain any consent, approval, or waiver required with respect to any
such Contract.

     

 

 



 

Section 6.7. _Public Announcements_. The Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to not, and Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to not, issue any press release, announcement or other public

the prior consent of the other (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed), except (a) any release or announcement
required by applicable Law or any rule or regulation of Nasdaq or any other
stock exchange to which the relevant Party is subject, in which case the Party
required to make the release or announcement shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to allow each other Party reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance; it being understood that the
final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so
required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing Party and (b) as
expressly permitted or required pursuant to _Section 6.3_. The Parties agree

in compensation or benefits or of the right to receive any severance or
termination compensation or benefit; (b) entry by the Company or its
Subsidiaries into any employment, consulting, indemnification, termination,

receipt of any written notice to the receiving Party from any third party
alleging that the consent or approval of such third party is or may be

of the transactions contemplated by this

     

 

 



 

Agreement and (c) upon receipt of any material notice or other material
communication from any Governmental Entity, Nasdaq or The New York Stock
Exchange (or any other securities market) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No notice given by any Party pursuant to this
_Section 6.16_ shall (x) limit or otherwise affect any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions contained in
this Agreement or (y) be deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure
Letter or constitute an exception to any representation or warranty. The
failure to comply with this _Section 6.16_ will not constitute the failure of
any condition set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ or _Annex I_ to be satisfied unless
the underlying event would independently result in the failure of such a
condition to be so satisfied.

 



 

Section 6.17. _Further Assurances_. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms or to vest the Surviving

capable of being cured within such period, it has not been cured within such

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _ARTICLE
VIII_, this Agreement (other than the last sentence of _Section 1.3_,
_Section 6.2(b)_, _ARTICLE VIII_ and _ARTICLE IX_, each of which will
survive any termination hereof) will become void and of no effect with no
liability on the part of any Party (or of any of its Representatives);
_provided_ ,

     

 

 



 

 _however_ , that no such termination will relieve any Person of any liability
for damages resulting from an intentional action or omission intentionally
taken or omitted to be taken that the breaching Party took (or failed to take)
with knowledge that such intentional act or omission would result or
reasonably be expected to result in a material breach of this Agreement (a "
_Willful Breach_ "). Parent shall cause the Offer to be terminated immediately
after any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_;

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_ or
_Section 8.4(c)_; or

 



 

(iii) (A) Parent or the Company terminates the Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.2(c)_ or (B) Parent terminates the Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.4(a)_ (arising solely from a breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Company) or _Section 8.4(d)_, then, in case of either clause
_(A)_ or _(B)_ , if (1) at or prior to the date this Agreement is terminated
pursuant thereto, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced,
disclosed or otherwise made public and not thereafter publicly withdrawn prior
to the date on which this Agreement is terminated, and (2) within twelve (12)
months after the Agreement is terminated, the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or consummates an Acquisition Proposal (in each case, whether or not
such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal described in clause
_(1)_ above) ( _provided_ that, for purposes of this _Section 8.5(b)_, the
term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal contained in _Section 6.3(g)(i)_ except that all
references to twenty-five percent (25%) shall be deemed references to fifty
percent (50%));

 



 

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of
$162,500,000, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
or accounts designated by Parent. Any payment required to be made (1) pursuant
to clause _(i)_ of this _Section 8.5(b)_ will be paid concurrently with such
termination, (2) pursuant to clause _(ii)_ of this _Section 8.5(b)_ will be
paid no later than two (2) Business Days after such termination and (3)
pursuant to clause _(iii)_ of this _Section 8.5(b)_ will be payable to
Parent upon consummation of the transaction referenced therein. The Company
will not be required to pay the termination fee pursuant to this _Section
8.5(b)_ more than once.

 



 

(a) Except in the case of Fraud or a Willful Breach of this Agreement, in the
event the termination fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_ is paid to
Parent in accordance with _Section 8.5(b)_, Parents right to receive a
termination fee is the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser in
respect of any breach of, or inaccuracy contained in, the Companys covenants,
agreements, representations, or warranties in this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Fraud_ " means an intentional misrepresentation of a
material fact with knowledge of its falsity and upon which the other Party
reasonably relied.

     

 

 



 

(b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in _Section
8.5(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Purchaser would not
have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent or Purchaser commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section 8.5(b)_,
the Company shall pay to Parent or Purchaser interest on such amount at the
prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually
received.

 



 

Section 8.6. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
each Party will bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 8.7. _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed by the Parties prior to the Acceptance
Time. At any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance by the other with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein, except that the Minimum Tender
Condition may only be waived by Parent or Purchaser with the prior written
consent of the Company. Any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set

thereby. The failure of any Party to assert any rights or remedies will not
constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

Section 9.3. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the fullest
extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.4. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of
law or otherwise without the prior written consent of each of the other
Parties; _provided_ that Parent may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or
all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.5. _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Letter and the exhibits, annexes, schedules
and instruments referred to herein), the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Tender and Support Agreements constitute the

     

 

 



 

entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the Parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof or thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Confidentiality Agreement (a) will survive the execution or termination of
this Agreement and remains in full force and effect and (b) will terminate as
of the Effective Time. Except as provided in _Section 6.5_ (which is intended
for the benefit of the Companys former and current officers and directors,
all of whom will be third-party beneficiaries of these provisions), this
Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any
rights or remedies. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
following the Effective Time the provisions of _ARTICLE II_ shall be
enforceable by holders of Certificates and holders of Book-Entry Shares solely
to the extent necessary to receive the Merger Consideration to which such
holders are entitled to thereunder.

 



 

Section 9.6. _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

 



 

Section 9.7. _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
and in the table of contents to this Agreement are included for convenience of
reference only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.8. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or email transmission) in one (1) or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed will become effective and be deemed to be an original but
all of which taken together will constitute one and the same agreement.

 



 

Section 9.9. _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties hereby (i) expressly and irrevocably submits to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or if such Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware, in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the actions of
Parent, Purchaser or the Company in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement in connection with this Agreement, (ii) agrees
that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (iii) agrees that
it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement, the Offer, or the
Merger in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
or if such Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware; _provided_ that each of
the Parties has the right to bring any action or proceeding for enforcement of
a judgment entered by such court in any other court or jurisdiction. The
Parties agree that a final trial court judgment in any such Proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdiction by suit on the
judgment or in any manner provided by Law; _provided_ that nothing in the
foregoing shall restrict any Partys right to seek any post-judgment relief
regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE SUCH PARTY

     

 

 



 

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT, OR ATTORNEY OF ANY PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION.

 



 

Section 9.10. _Service of Process_. Each Party irrevocably consents to the
service of process relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its
property, outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in
_Section 9.9(a)_ in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof
by registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested,
to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 9.2_. However, the
foregoing will not limit the right of a Party to effect service of process on
the other Party by any other legally available method.

 



 

Section 9.11. _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any breach of this
Agreement, irreparable harm would occur and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that (i) each Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to
which it may be entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction or any other
appropriate form of equitable relief, to compel specific performance and to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement in any
action without the posting of a bond or undertaking in connection with such
remedy, and (ii) the Parties shall, and hereby do, waive, in any action for
specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and any other
objections to specific performance of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the Parties rights to specific performance pursuant to
_Section 9.11(a)_, each Party may pursue any other remedy available to it at
law or in equity, including monetary damages; _provided_ that it is understood
and agreed that claims for monetary damages following termination of this
Agreement shall be (i) limited to those arising from or relating to Fraud or
any Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination and (ii)
subject to _Section 8.5(a)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, no Party is permitted to make any claim or commence any Proceeding
seeking monetary damages against any other Party in connection with or arising
out of this Agreement, the Offer, or the Merger; _provided_ that the foregoing
is without prejudice to the right of any Party to seek such monetary damages
following such termination in accordance with, and subject to the limitations
set forth in, this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.12. _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference will be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to

     

 

 



 

be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein,"
"hereby," "hereto," and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" will not be exclusive.
The phrases "date hereof" and "date of this Agreement" shall be deemed to
refer to December 3, 2018. Whenever used in this Agreement, any noun or
pronoun will be deemed to include the plural as well as the singular and to
cover all genders. All Exhibits annexed hereto or referred to herein are
hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in
full herein. The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning as
the word "shall." Any terms used in the Company Disclosure Letter, any Exhibit
or any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto but not
otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning as defined in this Agreement.
The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which
a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if."
All references to "dollars" or "$" shall refer to the lawful currency of the
United States. Unless the context requires otherwise (i) any definition of or
reference to any Contract, instrument or other document or any Law herein
shall be construed as referring to such Contract, instrument or other document
or Law as from time to time amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, (ii)
any reference herein to any Person shall be construed to include such Persons
successors and assigns, and (iii) all references herein to Articles, Sections
and Exhibits shall be construed to refer to Articles and Sections of, and
Exhibits to, this Agreement. Except with respect to _Section 6.3_, the words
"made available to Parent" and words of similar import refer to information
posted to the electronic data room for Project Topaz hosted by Merrill
Corporation at least two (2) calendar days prior to the date hereof (other
than in response to requests of Parent, Purchaser or its Representatives),
with the exception of the engagement letters referenced in _Section 4.21_,
which will be deemed made available if delivered one calendar day prior to the
date hereof, and maintained by the Company for purposes of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise delivered to Parent or a
Representative of Parent (including by email or by specific identification of
filing or exhibit to a filing available on the SECs Electronic Data-
Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system) at least two (2) calendar days prior
to the date hereof (other than in response to requests of Parent, Purchaser or
its Representatives). The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as jointly drafted by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

least one share more than fifty percent (50%) of all Shares outstanding as of
the consummation of the Offer (such condition in this Paragraph 1(a) being,

calculating whether the Minimum Tender Condition has been satisfied, the
aggregate number of Shares outstanding shall (i) include, without duplication,
to the extent "received" by the "depositary" (as such terms are defined in
Section 251(h)(6) of the DGCL) Shares issuable in respect of (A) Company Stock
Options for which the holders thereof have satisfied all of the requirements
for exercise thereof prior to the expiration of the Offer, even if delivery of
Shares resulting from such exercises to the respective option holders has not
occurred prior to the expiration of the Offer and (B) outstanding restricted
or unrestricted stock units of the Company for which the holders thereof have
satisfied all of the requirements for vesting thereof prior to the expiration
of the Offer, even if delivery of the Shares resulting from such vesting to
the respective holders thereof has not occurred prior to the expiration of the
Offer, and (ii) not include Shares held in treasury by the Company as of the

(b) (i) the Company has breached or failed to comply in any material respect
with any of its agreements or covenants to be performed or complied with by it

as though made on and as of the Expiration Date, and (y) are made as of a
specific date are not true as of such date, in each case, except, in the case
of _(x)_ or _(y)_ , where the failure of such representations and warranties
to be true and correct (without giving effect to any qualification as to
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect") has not had, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; (iii) the representations and
warranties set forth in the first sentence of _Section 4.1_, _Section
4.4(a)_ and _Section 4.20_ are not true and correct (without giving effect to
any qualification as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect") in all
material respects as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such
date and time (except to the extent that any such representation and warranty
expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and
warranty is not true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier
date); (iv) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.3(a)_,
_Section 4.3(b)_ and _Section 4.3(d)_ are not true and correct in all
respects, other than in _de minimis_ respects, as of the Expiration Date as
though made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any
such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in
which case such representation and warranty is not true and correct, other
than in _de minimis_ respects, as of such earlier date) or (v) the
representation and warranty set forth in _Section 4.11(b)_ shall not be true
and correct in all respects at such time;

 



 

(c) the Company has not delivered to Parent a certificate dated as of the
Expiration Date signed on behalf of the Company by a senior executive officer
of the Company to the effect that the conditions set forth in Paragraphs 2(b)
and 2(d) have been satisfied as of the Expiration Date;

accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the benefit of Parent and Purchaser and,
except for the Minimum Tender Condition and the conditions set forth in
clauses 2 _(a)_ and 2 _(e)_ , may be waived (where permitted by applicable
Law) by Parent or Purchaser in whole or in part at any time or from time to
time prior to the Expiration Date, in each case, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC.
