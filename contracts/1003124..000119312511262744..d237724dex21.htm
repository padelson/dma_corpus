RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Merger Sub and the

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company in accordance with the provisions of the North Carolina
Business Corporation Act (the " _NCBCA_ ") and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as

Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises,
shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II.
The Merger shall have the effects specified in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the NCBCA.

 



1 1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII, the closing for the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 885
Third Avenue, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the later
of (x) the second business day following the day on which the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement and (y) the final day of the
Marketing Period, or such earlier date as may be specified by Parent on no
less than two (2) business days prior notice to the Company. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _business day_ " shall mean any day
ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day
on which banks are required or authorized by Law to close in the City of New
York.

 

1.3. _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Parent will cause
articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be executed,
acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of North
Carolina as provided in Section 55-11-05 of the NCBCA, in such form as
required by and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
NCBCA. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Articles of
Merger have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of North
Carolina or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in writing
and specified in the Articles of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE II

 

Articles of Incorporation and

Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation

2.1. _Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of incorporation of the
Company shall be amended as a result of the Merger so as to read in its
entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A _hereto and, as so amended, shall be the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ "),
until duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to
Section 6.11(e)).

2.2. _Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the
bylaws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to
Section 6.11(e)).

ARTICLE III

Officers and Directors

 

of the Surviving Corporation

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary so that the board of directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until their

 



2  successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the
Bylaws.

 

3.2. _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;

Exchange of Certificates

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or the sole shareholder of Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Except as provided in Section 4.3(d), each share
of the common stock, par value $0.05 per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ "
or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than (i) issued and outstanding Shares owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company and in each case not held on behalf of third parties
and (ii) Shares that are owned by shareholders (" _Dissenting Shareholders_ ")
who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for, or lost their right to,
appraisal pursuant to Article 13 of the NCBCA, if applicable, with respect to
such Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ," and together with the Shares
referred to in the immediately preceding clause (i), the " _Excluded Shares_
")) shall be converted into the right to receive $33.25 per Share in cash (the
" _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for
each such Share, without interest, in accordance with this Section 4.1 and
Section 4.2 hereof.

(b) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_.

(i) Except as set forth in clause (ii) below, each Excluded Share, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist subject to the right of the
Record Holder of any Dissenting Shares to receive the payment for such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 4.2(g). As used in this Article IV, the
term " _Record Holder_ " means, with respect to any Shares, a Person who was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder of record of such Shares.

(ii) Each Share held by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and
shall be

 



3  converted into that number of Surviving Corporation Shares that bears the
same ratio to the aggregate number of outstanding Surviving Corporation Shares
as the number of Shares held by such Subsidiary bore to the aggregate number
of outstanding Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (each, a " _Surviving
Corporation Share_ ").

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the Record Holders of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares), a cash amount in immediately available
funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under Section 4.1(a)
(such cash amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
If a Dissenting Shareholder effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses
its rights to, appraisal pursuant to Article 13 of the NCBCA with respect to
any Dissenting Shares, (i) such Shares shall cease to be Excluded Shares and
(ii) Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the Paying
Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of
Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting Shareholder has withdrawn its
demand for, or lost its rights to, appraisal pursuant to Article 13 of
the NCBCA and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
aggregate amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be returned to the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 4.2(e). To the extent that
there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent
to make prompt cash payment under Section 4.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments
under Section 4.1(a).

(b)  _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within two business
days) after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each Record Holder of Shares (other than with respect to
Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or uncertificated
Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(f)) to the Paying Agent or, in case of Book-Entry
Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal, such letter of transmittal to be in customary form and to have
such other

 



4  provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(f)) or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the amount to which such Record Holder is
entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a). If any Excluded
Shares cease, pursuant to Section 4.2(a), to be Excluded Shares, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent promptly (and in any event
within two business days) after the date on which such Excluded Shares cease
to be Excluded Shares to mail to the Record Holder of such Shares the letter
of transmittal and instructions referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence, with respect to such Shares. Upon delivery of such letter of
transmittal by any Record Holder of Shares (other than with respect to
Excluded Shares), duly completed and duly executed in accordance with its
instructions, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably
require, and (other than with respect to Book-Entry Shares) the surrender to
the Paying Agent of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented such Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided
in Section 4.2(f)), such Record Holder shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a cash amount by check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by such holder (less any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) equal to the product
of (x) the number of Shares formerly represented by such Certificate (or
subject to such affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(f)) or Book-Entry Share and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and
the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check
for any cash to be delivered upon compliance with the procedures described
above may be issued to the transferee if the applicable letter of transmittal
is accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Surviving
Corporation to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) _Special Payment Procedures for DTC_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent
and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing
occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date, the
Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an amount
in cash in immediately available funds equal to the product of (x) the number
of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing
occurs after 11:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent
will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first business day after the
Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC
Payment.

 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled
and, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 4.2(b),
exchanged for the cash amount to which the Record Holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this Article IV (less any required Tax withholdings as provided
in Section 4.2(h)) to be paid by check or wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by such holder.

 



5 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Record Holders of the Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
amount to which such Record Holder is entitled as a result of the Merger
pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in
Section 4.2(h)), without any interest thereon, upon (i) due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(f)) or Book-Entry Shares and (ii) if requested by the Surviving
Corporation, delivery of a letter of transmittal in customary form that is
provided promptly to such Record Holder by the Surviving Corporation and such
other documents as reasonably required, in each case, to the Surviving
Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization,
Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the
amount (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h))
equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate (other than a Certificate formerly
representing Excluded Shares) and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(g) _Dissenting Shares_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Article 13 of the NCBCA with respect to any Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with
respect to such Dissenting Shares unless and until such Person shall have
effectively withdrawn its demand for, or lost its right to, appraisal under
the NCBCA with respect to such Dissenting Shares. Unless and until a
Dissenting Shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn its demand for, or
lost its right to, appraisal under the NCBCA with respect to Dissenting
Shares, each Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to receive only the
payment provided by Article 13 of the NCBCA with respect to such Dissenting
Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws that are received by the
Company relating to shareholders rights of appraisal. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable in respect of the Shares, Company Options, Restricted Shares
and RSUs cancelled in the Merger

 



6  such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), any regulation promulgated thereunder by the United States
Department of Treasury (a " _Treasury Regulation_ ") or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options, Restricted Shares
or RSUs in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

4.3. _Treatment of Outstanding Options, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock
Units_.

 

(a) _Options_. Except as provided in Section 4.3(d), at the Effective Time,
each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Shares issued under the
Stock Plans (as defined in Section 5.1(b)) or otherwise, vested or unvested
(each a " _Company Option_ "), shall become fully vested, and shall be
cancelled and thereafter only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later
than five business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to
(i) the product of (A) the total number of Shares subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of
the Per Share Merger Consideration _over_ the exercise price per Share under
such Company Option, less (ii) applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, except as provided in
Section 4.3(d), if the exercise price per share of any Company Option is equal
to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Company Option
shall, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Stock Plan and
Company Option, be cancelled without consideration.

(b)  _Restricted Stock_. Except as provided in Section 4.3(d), at the
Effective Time, each outstanding share of restricted stock granted under the
Stock Plans, vested or unvested (each a " _Restricted Share_ "), shall become
fully vested and free of any forfeiture restriction and be treated as
provided in Section 4.1.

(c) _Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Restricted Stock Unit issued under the Stock Plans or otherwise, vested or
unvested (each an " _RSU_ "), shall become fully vested, be cancelled and
thereafter only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three
business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash, for each RSU,
equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration plus all cash dividend
equivalents accrued thereon, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payment.

(d)  _Rollover Awards_.

(i) Without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Option
and Restricted Share set forth on Section 4.3(d) of the Company Exceptions
Letter that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, an " _Excepted Equity Award_ ") shall be assumed or substituted by
Parent or, at the election of Parent, the Equity

 



7  Rollover Designee and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an
option or restricted share award, as the case may be (each, an " _Assumed
Award_ "), denominated in shares of common stock or other equity securities
of Parent or, at the election of Parent, the Equity Rollover Designee ("
_Rollover Equity Securities_ "). The Assumed Awards shall be subject to such
terms and conditions as may be determined by Parent or the Equity Rollover
Designee in its sole discretion, subject to Section 4.3(d)(ii). For the
avoidance of doubt, no Excepted Equity Award shall be entitled to the
treatment described in Sections 4.3(a), (b) or (c). For purposes of the
foregoing, the " _Equity Rollover Designee_ " means a Subsidiary of Parent or
any Affiliate or permitted assignee of Parent designated by Parent that,
immediately following the later of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the
consummation of any related restructuring transactions, controls the Surviving
Corporation.

(ii) Each Assumed Award shall have a vesting schedule that is the same as the
vesting schedule of the related Excepted Equity Award and shall provide that
unless determined otherwise by Parent or the Equity Rollover Designee, the
receipt of Rollover Equity Securities from such Assumed Award shall be
conditioned on the holder executing and delivering to Parent or the Equity
Rollover Designee, as applicable, a stockholders agreement (or similar
agreement) in the form prepared by Parent or the Equity Rollover Designee.
The number of Rollover Equity Securities subject to each Assumed Award shall
be determined by multiplying the number of Shares subject to the related
Excepted Equity Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share). With respect to each Assumed
Award that is an option to purchase Rollover Equity Securities, the exercise
price per share or unit of Rollover Equity Securities (rounded upwards to the
nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise price for the
Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to the related Excepted Equity Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio. The
" _Exchange Ratio_ " shall be equal to the quotient of (1) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, divided by (2) the fair market value of a share or unit
of Rollover Equity Securities immediately following the Effective Time, as
determined by Parent consistent with the price paid by the equityholders of
Parent (or the Equity Rollover Designee) for (including contributions by such
equityholders with respect to) their respective equity interests in Parent or
the Equity Rollover Designee, as applicable.

(e) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Board of Directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions and will
take such other appropriate actions to implement the provisions of Sections
4.3(a), 4.3(b), 4.3(c) and 4.3(d) and to terminate the Stock Plans at the
Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall cooperate
with Parent with respect to the foregoing and shall take all reasonable
actions in relation to the termination of the Stock Plans and
the cancellation or assumption, as applicable, of the awards thereunder that
may be requested by Parent and shall otherwise use its reasonable best efforts
to ensure that holders of Company Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs will
have no rights from and after the Effective Time with respect to such Company
Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs other than the right to receive, as
applicable, the cash payments specified in Sections 4.3(a), 4.3(b) and 4.3(c)
or the Assumed Awards as provided under Section 4.3(d).

 



8 4.4. _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. If the Closing shall occur prior to the
end of the offering period in existence under the Companys Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Current Offering Period_ "), the Company shall take all actions necessary
to (i) terminate the ESPP in its entirety as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) cause a new exercise date to be set under the ESPP,
which date shall be the business day immediately prior to the anticipated
Closing Date. The Company has not, following the start of the Current
Offering Period, allowed any participant to increase his or her payroll
deduction election under the ESPP, and, following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall not permit any participant in the ESPP to increase the
amount of such participants current payroll deduction election. If the
Closing does not occur prior to the end of the Current Offering Period and the
Company permits a new offering period to begin under the ESPP, (x) the
Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the ESPP in its entirety
prior to the Effective Time and shall cause the entire amount credited to the
stock purchase account of each participant thereunder as of the date of such
termination to be distributed to the participant in accordance with Section
7.2 of the ESPP, such that no participant in the ESPP shall be entitled to
purchase any Shares in respect of such offering period under the ESPP,
and (y) the Company shall, within a reasonable period of time prior to the
commencement of such new offering period, notify all actual or potential
participants in the ESPP of the impact the Closing will have with respect to
participation in the ESPP for such offering period (including the fact that
the Closing will have the impact described in clause (x) above). Following the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent an opportunity to
review and comment on any written notices, communications or other documents
provided to actual or potential participants in the ESPP that relate to the
ESPP and their participation therein pursuant to clause (y) of the preceding
sentence (excluding informal communications with individual participants) and
shall consider in good faith any comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

 

4.5. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and, as so
adjusted, shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share
Merger Consideration. 

ARTICLE V

Representations and Warranties

5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in

disclaimer and any other forward-looking statement of risk that does not

warns and (B) solely to the extent it is reasonably apparent solely on the
face of that disclosure in such Company Reports that such disclosure would
qualify the representations and warranties contained herein),

 



9   _provided_ that nothing in the Company Reports shall be deemed to modify or
qualify the representations set forth in Section 5.1(b), 5.1(c), 5.1(j) or

Sub that:

ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or the conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where any such failure on the
part of the Company or any Subsidiary to be so qualified and in good standing,

incorporation and bylaws or comparable organizational and governing documents,
each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so made available
is in full force and effect on the date of this Agreement. As used in this

Section 6.5(b), the term "Affiliate" shall not include (A) the direct or

10 (iv) " _Exchange Act_ " means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended; and

(v) " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means a change, event, occurrence or
effect that has a material adverse effect on (x) the financial condition,

of the following, and no changes, events, occurrences or effects, individually
or in the aggregate, to the extent arising out of, resulting from or
attributable to any of the following, shall constitute or be taken into
account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred
or may, would or could occur pursuant to clause (x) above:

(A) (1) changes generally affecting the economy, credit, capital or financial
markets or political conditions of or in the United States or elsewhere in the
world, including changes in credit ratings, interest and exchange rates, (2)

hostilities, sabotage or terrorism, or any escalation or worsening of any such
acts of war (whether or not declared), armed hostilities, sabotage or
terrorism or (3) epidemics, pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados or
other natural disasters, _provided_ , _however_ , that the exception in this
clause with respect to changes in credit ratings shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any change, event, occurrence or effect
underlying such change has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material
Adverse Effect,

 

(B) changes that are the result of factors generally affecting the industries
in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate or in which the products or

or enforcement thereof after the date hereof,

(F) any failure by the Company to meet any internal or public projections
or forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings for any period, _provided_
, _however_ , that the exception in this clause shall not prevent or otherwise
affect a determination that any change, event, occurrence or effect underlying
such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse
Effect,

 



11 (G) (1) any action taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries at Parents
written request or (2) the failure to take any action by the Company or its
Subsidiaries if that action is prohibited by Section 6.1(a) of this Agreement
to the extent that Parent fails to give its consent after receipt of a written
request therefor, 

(H) any change resulting or arising from the identity of, or any facts or
circumstances relating to, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates,
and

(I) a decline in the price or trading volume of the Company common stock on
the Nasdaq Stock Market (" _Nasdaq_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that the
exception in this clause shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination
that any change, event, occurrence or effect underlying such decline has
resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse Effect; and

_provided_ , _further_ , that (x) with respect to clauses (A), (B) and (E),
such changes, events or occurrences do not materially and disproportionately
adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared
to other companies operating primarily in the same industries in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries operate and (y) clauses (C) and (D) shall
not apply to the use of Company Material Adverse Effect in Section 5.1(d) (or
Section 7.2(a) as it applies to Section 5.1(d)).

 

(b) _Capital Structure._ The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 190,000,000 Shares, of which 113,596,899 Shares were outstanding
(including issued shares of unvested restricted stock) as of the close of
business on September 30, 2011. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As
of September 30, 2011, other than 17,484,412 Shares reserved for issuance
under the Company Equity Compensation Plan and the ESPP (together, the "
_Stock Plans_ "), the Company has no Shares reserved for issuance. Section
5.1(b)(i) of the Company Exceptions Letter contains a correct and complete
list as of the date of this Agreement of outstanding Company Options,
Restricted Shares and RSUs, including for each award (as applicable) the
holder (the specific identity of whom may be redacted to the extent required
by applicable Laws), type of award, number of Shares, the country in which the
holder resides, applicable Stock Plan, vesting commencement date, vesting
schedule and exercise price with respect to Company Options. Except as set
forth in Section 5.1(b) of the Company Exceptions Letter, each of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity securities of each of the
Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and, except for directors qualifying shares listed in Section
5.1(b) of the Company Exceptions Letter, owned by the Company or by a direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any
lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a "
_Lien_ ") except for such transfer restrictions of general applicability as
may be provided under the Securities Act and other applicable securities
Laws. Except as set forth above or as described in Section 5.1(b) of the
Company Exceptions Letter, there are no preemptive or other outstanding
rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation
rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements,
calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any
Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any

 



12  equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens. The Company does not
have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the
holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable
for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company
on any matter. For purposes of this Agreement, a wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company shall include any Subsidiary of the Company of which all of the
shares of capital stock of such Subsidiary, other than director qualifying
shares listed in Section 5.1(b) of the Company Exceptions Letter, are owned by
the Company (or a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company).

(c) _Corporate Authority._

 

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute and deliver this Agreement
and, subject only to, assuming the representations and warranties of Parent
and Merger Sub set forth in Section 5.2(k) are true and correct, adoption of
this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares
entitled to vote on such matter at a shareholders meeting duly called and
held for such purpose (the " _Company Requisite Vote_ "), to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity
principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

 

(ii) As of the date hereof, the Board of Directors of the Company has, by
resolutions duly adopted at a meeting duly called and held, which resolutions
have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn as of the time of the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, by unanimous vote of those directors present
(which directors constituted not less than two thirds of the members of
the Board of Directors of the Company then in office) (A) determined that the
Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
shareholders, approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and has resolved, subject to
Section 6.2, to recommend adoption of this Agreement to the holders of Shares
(the " _Company Recommendation_ "), (B) directed that this Agreement be
submitted to the holders of Shares for their adoption at a shareholders
meeting duly called and held for such purpose and (C) received the opinion of
each of its financial advisors, Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC and Lazard Freres and
Co., LLC, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon
and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share
Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by the holders of Shares is
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. It is agreed and
understood that such opinions are for the benefit of the Companys Board of
Directors and may not be relied on by Parent or Merger Sub. An executed copy
of such opinions will be delivered to Parent and Merger Sub promptly after
execution of this Agreement.

 



13 (iii) Assuming the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set
forth in Section 5.2(k) are true and correct, the Company Requisite Vote is
the only vote of the Shares necessary to adopt this Agreement.

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts._

(i) Except for (A) the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (B) the applicable requirements
of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "
_HSR Act_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (C) the
applicable requirements of Nasdaq, (D) the filing with the Secretary of State
of the State of North Carolina of the Articles of Merger as required by the
NCBCA, (E) the filing with the European Commission of a merger notification
in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 139/2004, the E.C. Merger
Regulation (the " _ECMR_ "), (F) the applicable requirements of the competent
authority of any member state of the European Union to which any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is referred pursuant to Article 9
of the ECMR and (G) the applicable requirements of antitrust, competition or
other similar Laws, rules, regulations and judicial doctrines of
jurisdictions other than the United States, no notices, reports or other
filings are required to be made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any domestic or
foreign governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court
or other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity (each a "
_Governmental Entity_ "), in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Merger by the Company and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except
those that the failure to make or obtain are not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger by the Company and the other

breach or violation of, or a default under, the articles of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a
breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default

terminable by any party thereto on 180 calendar days or less notice (each, a
" _Contract_ ") to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or any of their
respective properties are bound or (C) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 5.1(d)(i), a violation of any Law to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause (B) or

Effect.

misleading. As of the date hereof, there are no material outstanding or
unresolved comments received from the SEC with respect to any of the Company
Reports.

except as may be noted therein.

 

(iv) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that material information required to be

SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company maintains internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as

Agreement. Since December 31, 2010 through the date of this Agreement, there

consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP or

(iv) The term " _Knowledge_ " when used in this Agreement with respect to the
Company shall mean the actual knowledge of those persons set forth in Section
5.1(g)(iv) of the Company Exceptions Letter without obligation of any further
review or inquiry, and does not include information of which they may be
deemed to have constructive knowledge only.

(h) _Employee Benefits._

 

(i) As used herein, " _Benefit Plans_ " shall mean all benefit and/or deferred
compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements relating to or
covering current or former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
" _Employees_ ") and/or current or former directors or other service providers
of the Company, in each case under which there is or may be any liability or
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including, but not
limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")
(whether or not subject to ERISA), and any and all other deferred
compensation, severance, equity compensation, stock option, stock purchase,
stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive, change in control, bonus,
health insurance, fringe benefits, profit sharing and pension plans. All
material Benefit Plans are listed on Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company
Exceptions Letter and are categorized by country. True and complete copies of
all Benefit Plans listed on Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Exceptions
Letter have been made available to Parent, and with respect to each such U.S.
Benefit Plan and each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan that provides for any pension,
severance or post-retirement benefits, the Company has made available to
Parent (A) the most recently prepared actuarial report or financial statement,
if any, (B) the most recent summary plan description, and all material
modifications thereto, (C) copies of any material written correspondence with
a Governmental Entity regarding audits or noncompliance with applicable Law
with respect to any material Benefit Plan, (D) any funding arrangements

and other applicable Laws, and all contributions required to be made under the
terms of any of the U.S. Benefit Plans as of the date of this Agreement have
been timely made or, if not yet due, have been properly reflected in the
financial statements in accordance with GAAP prior to the date of this
Agreement, except for such failures that, individually or in the aggregate,
are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
U.S. Benefit Plan, which is subject to ERISA (an " _ERISA Plan_ ") that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA (a " _Pension Plan_ ") intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, has received an advisory, notification or determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") that confirms that the language
of such Plan meets the requirements for qualification under Section 401(a) of
the Code, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist as of
the date

 



17  hereof that are likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such
ERISA Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. To the Knowledge of the Company,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction
with respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such
transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject the Company or any
Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount that would be material.

(iii) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any other entity that,
together with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is treated as a single
employer under Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA (each, a "
_Company ERISA Affiliate_ ") maintains or contributes or has within the past
six years maintained or contributed to a Pension Plan that is subject to
subtitles C or D of Title IV of ERISA. None of the U.S. Benefit Plans is a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA ("
_Multiemployer Plan_ "), and neither the Company nor any Company ERISA
Affiliate has at any time within the past six years contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan.

(iv) There is no (and during the past two years there has been no) material
proceeding, claim or suit pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened relating to the Benefit Plans, other than routine claims for
benefits. None of the Benefit Plans provides for medical, life or death
benefits beyond termination of service or retirement, other than pursuant to
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, any
similar state or local Law or any foreign Law.

(v) Neither the execution of this Agreement, the adoption of this Agreement by
holders of Shares constituting the Company Requisite Vote nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event) will (A) entitle any employee, officer, director or
individual consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to
severance pay (other than severance pay required by any Law) or any increase
in severance pay upon any termination of employment, (B) except as required by
any Law, result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or
increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or benefit to
any employee, officer, director or individual consultant of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company or result in any limitation on the right of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to amend, merge, terminate or receive
a reversion of assets from any Benefit Plan, or (C) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or exercisability, or result in any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans.

(vi) No amount that has been or could be received (whether in cash, property,
the vesting of property or otherwise) as a result of or in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone
or in combination with any other event), by any current or former employee,
officer, director or other service provider of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) could be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No Benefit
Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 of
the Code or otherwise.

 



18 (vii) All Company Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs can be cancelled by
their terms in accordance with Sections 4.3(a), 4.3(b) and 4.3(c) and the
ESPP can be terminated by its terms in accordance with Section 4.4.

(viii) Each Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and any award thereunder,
in each case, that is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code, (i) has been operated in good faith compliance with Section
409A of the Code since January 1, 2005, and all applicable regulations and
notices issued thereunder, and (ii) since January 1, 2009, has been in
documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(ix) All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans have been maintained in compliance with
applicable local Law, except for such failures to comply that, individually
or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans that are intended to be funded
and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate,
based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions, except as is not reasonably
likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are defined benefit pension plans and none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or has at any time been the
employer, or connected or associated with the employer (as those terms are
used in the UK Pensions Act 2004) of a UK defined benefit pension plan.

(i) The businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries have not been
since the Applicable Date, and are not being, conducted in violation of any

arbitration award, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental
Entity (each, a " _Law_ ", and collectively, " _Laws_ "), except for
violations that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except with respect to regulatory

the past five years committed any knowing and willful violation of U.S. Laws
governing international business activities, including export control laws,
trade and economic sanctions, or the Foreign

 



19  Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the " _Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act_ "), except for violations that, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge
of the Company and as of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is currently or has been within the past five years
the target of any inquiry, investigation, settlement, plea agreement or
enforcement action by a U.S. Governmental Entity involving an alleged or
suspected violation of U.S. Laws governing international business activities,
including export control laws, trade and economic sanctions, or the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, except for such inquiries, investigations, settlements,
plea agreements or enforcement actions that, individually or in the aggregate,
are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(j) _Takeover Statutes._ No "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "interested shareholder," "business combination" or other
similar anti-takeover statute or regulation enacted under state or federal
Laws in the United States (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") is applicable to
the Company, the Shares, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. As of the date hereof, the Company does not have in effect any
shareholder rights plan or "poison pill".

Consideration, any other repayment or refinancing of

 



33  debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Commitments, payment of
all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and payment of all related fees and
expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of
the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_
" when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of
determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, exceed the value of all "liabilities of
such Person, including a reasonable estimate of contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c)
such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this
definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including a reasonable
estimate of contingent and other liabilities" means that such Person will be
able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

(i) _No Competing Businesses_. As of the date of this Agreement, to the
Knowledge of Parent, none of Parents Affiliates are engaged in, and neither

securities (including any securities that may be acquired through the exchange
or exercise of rights, warrants or options) constituting more than 5% of the
outstanding capital stock of any Person primarily engaged, as of the date
hereof, in the businesses of providing drug discovery, drug development or
drug lifecycle management services anywhere in the world (a " _Competing
Business_ ").

 

(j) _Guarantees_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Guarantors have delivered to the Company the duly executed Guarantees. Each
of the Guarantees is in full force and effect and is a valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of the applicable Guarantor, subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception. No event has occurred, which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the
Guarantor under its Guarantee.

(k) _Ownership of Shares_. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of their Affiliates
"beneficially owns" (as such phrase is defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange
Act) shares of capital stock of the Company representing more than 5% of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.

(l) _Absence of Certain Agreements_. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or
authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), pursuant to which: (i)
any shareholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Per Share Merger Consideration or
pursuant to which any

 



34  shareholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the
Merger or agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal; (ii) any third party
(other than limited partners and other investors and co-investors of

Merger; or (iii) except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, any
current employee of the Company has agreed to (x) remain as an employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (other than

contribute or roll-over any portion of such employees Shares, Company
Options, Restricted Shares and/or RSUs to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Parent or any of its Affiliates or (z) receive any capital stock or equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its
Affiliates.

(m) _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.1, Parent and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any other

affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any other Person, will
have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the delivery, dissemination or
any other distribution to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person, or the use
by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person, of any such information provided
or made available to them by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates,
advisors, agents or representatives, or any other Person, including
any information, documents, estimates, projections, forecasts or other
forward-looking information, business plans or other material provided or made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person in certain "data rooms,"
confidential information memoranda or management presentations in
anticipation or contemplation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(n) _Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-
Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and might continue to receive from the Company estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
business plan information, regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective businesses and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as
well as in such business plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are
familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making
their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information or business plans), and that, except as expressly provided in
this Agreement,

 



35  Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, or any other
Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge that none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of
their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates,
advisors, agents or representatives, nor any other Person, has made or is
making any representation or warranty with respect to such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans

Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall have the right to: (i) initiate,
solicit and encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposals or offers
that constitute Acquisition Proposals, including by way of providing access
to non-public information to any Person pursuant to confidentiality agreements
on customary terms not materially more favorable to such Person than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreements (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreements need not prohibit the making or amendment of an
Acquisition Proposal); _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours thereafter) make available to Parent and Merger Sub any
material non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
that the Company provides to any Person given such access that was not

(b)  _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as expressly permitted by this
Section 6.2 and except as may relate to any Person, group of Persons or group
that includes any Person or group of Persons from whom the Company has
received during the Go-Shop Period a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
independent financial advisor) prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal (any such Person or group
of Persons, an " _Excluded Party_ "), the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers and directors shall, and the Company shall instruct
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries other
Representatives to, (i) at 12:00 a.m. on the 31st calendar day after the date
of this Agreement (the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_ ") immediately cease
any discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal and request promptly that

 



39  such Persons return or destroy all confidential information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries provided by or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and (ii) from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VIII, not (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries
or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes an Acquisition
Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions

Party when the ultimate equityholder(s) of such Person or group, as of
the No-Shop Period Start Date, cease to provide (directly or indirectly) at
least 50% of the equity financing (measured by voting power and value) of such
Person or group at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and the
Company receives actual notice or obtains actual knowledge thereof.

(c) _Conduct Following No-Shop Period Start Date_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to the last sentence of this
Section 6.2(c), at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior
to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if the
Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any Person
that did not result from a material breach of Section 6.2(b), the Company and
its Representatives may contact such Person to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof and, subject to compliance with this Section 6.2 and after
giving written notice to Parent, (i) the Company and its Representatives may
provide non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries in
response to a request therefor by such Person if the Company receives from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms not
materially more favorable to such Person than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreements (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of an Acquisition
Proposal); _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within
24 hours thereafter) make available to Parent and Merger Sub any
material non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
that the Company made available to any Person given such access which was not
previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) the Company and its
Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with such Person and (iii) after having complied with Section 6.2(e), the
Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may authorize,
adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable or propose to
authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or
otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x)
prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Board
of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such
action is reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the directors duties
under applicable Law, (y) in each such case referred to in clause (i) or (ii)
above, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and independent financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, and (z) in the case referred to in clause (iii) above, the
Board of

 



40  Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisor and after complying with Section 6.2(e)) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
the occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may continue to
engage in the activities described in Section 6.2(a) with respect to any
Excluded Party, including with respect to any amended proposal submitted by
any Excluded Party following the No-Shop Period Start Date, and the
restrictions in Section 6.2(b) shall not apply with respect thereto.

(d) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer with respect to (i)
a merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
involving the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries or, (ii) any acquisition
by any Person or group of Persons, whether by tender offer or share exchange
or in any other manner, which if consummated would result in, any Person or
group of Persons becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in
one or a series of related transactions, more than 20% of the total voting
power or of any class of equity securities of the Company, or more than 20%
of the consolidated total assets (including, equity securities of its
Subsidiaries) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each
case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an Acquisition Proposal (with the
percentages set forth in the definition of such term changed from 20% to
50%), that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof has
determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and independent financial advisor) (i) is reasonably likely to
be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal (including the financing
thereof) and the Person making the proposal, and (ii) would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial
point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (taking into
account the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of consummation as
compared to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement as it may be
amended or proposed to be amended by Parent in accordance with Section 6.2(e)
below).

(iii) " _Excluded Party Superior Proposal_ " means any Superior Proposal made
by an Excluded Party.

(e) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except
as set forth in this Section 6.2(e), Section 6.2(f), Section 8.3(a) or Section
8.3(c), the Board of Directors of the Company and each committee thereof
shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger or adopt, authorize, approve
or recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve
or recommend, or resolve to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal
(it being understood that the Board of Directors of the Company may take no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business
on the 10th business day after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal

 



41  pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act without such action being
considered an adverse modification); or

(ii) except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3(a), cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(c)) (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Board of
Directors of the Company and any committee thereof may withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify the Company Recommendation or approve, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof believes in good faith is a
Superior Proposal (including any Excluded Party Superior Proposal) made after
the date hereof, if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that, solely as a result of (x) an event, development, occurrence, or
change in circumstances or facts (in each case, other than an Acquisition
Proposal) occurring or arising after the date hereof, which event,
development, occurrence, or change in circumstances or facts did not exist or
was not actually known by the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date
of this Agreement, or (y) a Superior Proposal, the failure to do so is
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law (a "
_Change of Recommendation_ ") and may also take action pursuant to Section
8.3(a) or Section 8.3(c); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal, or
take any action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal
unless: (x) the Company notifies Parent in writing, 72 hours in advance, that
it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Proposal, or to take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the identity of the party
who made such Superior Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal and attach the most current version of the agreement
reflecting such terms and conditions; (y) after providing such notice and
prior to making such Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Proposal, or taking any action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a
Superior Proposal, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent
during such 72 hour period (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate)
to make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the
Board of Directors of the Company not to effect a Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or to take such action pursuant to
Section 8.3(a) in response to a Superior Proposal; and (z) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the Guarantees offered
in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a binding contract if
accepted by the Company and shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor)
that the Superior Proposal, would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal
if such changes offered in writing by Parent were to be given effect;
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not effect a
Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal, or take any
action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal, prior
to the time that is 72 hours after it has provided the written notice required
by clause (x) above; _provided further_  that in the event that

 



42  the Acquisition Proposal is thereafter modified by the party making such
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide written notice of such
modified Acquisition Proposal and shall again comply with this Section
6.2(e), except that the deadline for such new written notice shall be reduced
to 24 hours (rather than the 72 hours otherwise contemplated by this Section
6.2(e)) and the time the Company shall be permitted to effect a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal, or to take action
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal, shall be
reduced to the time that is 24 hours after it has provided such written
notice (rather than the time that is 72 hours otherwise contemplated by this
Section 6.2(e)).

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to shareholders), or (ii) making any "stop-
look-and-listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the shareholders of the Company);  _provided_ , that in no
event shall this Section 6.2(f) affect the obligations of the Company
specified in Sections 6.2(b), (d), (e) and (g) (and for the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Section 6.2(f) shall effect a determination that a
Change of Recommendation has occurred).

(g) _Notice_. Within three business days following the No-Shop Period Start
Date, the Company shall notify Parent of the number of Excluded Parties and
provide Parent with a written summary of the material terms and conditions of
any Acquisition Proposal received from any Excluded Party (which
material terms and conditions shall include the identity of the Person or
group of Persons making the Acquisition Proposal). From and after the No-Shop
Period Start Date, the Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any
event, within 24 hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection
with such notice, the identity of the Person making the proposal or offer and
the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if

the status of any such discussions or negotiations. In the event that any
party modifies its Acquisition Proposal in any material respect, the
Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing within 24 hours of receipt
of such modification of the fact that such Acquisition Proposal has been
modified and the terms of such modification (including, if applicable, copies
of any written documentation reflecting such modification). The Company
agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter any confidentiality
agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from
providing to Parent such material terms and conditions and other information.

thereafter) notify Parent of the identity of any Person with which the Company
enters into such a confidentiality agreement.

date that is 15 business days after the date hereof, a proxy statement in
preliminary form relating to the Shareholders

 



43  Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company agrees that at the date of
mailing to shareholders of the Company and at the time of the Shareholders
Meeting, (i) the Proxy Statement will comply with the applicable provisions of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the
information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent and
Merger Sub agree that none of the information supplied by either of them or
any of their Affiliates for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or, in each case, any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and shall consider in good faith any
comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

6.4. _Shareholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and bylaws, all reasonable
action necessary to convene a meeting of record holders of Shares (the "
_Shareholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable (and in any event no more
than 21 business days) after the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement to
consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement; _ provided_ ,
_however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may postpone or adjourn
the Shareholders Meeting (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence
of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Board of Directors
of the Company has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys
shareholders prior to the Shareholders Meeting, (iv) to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent the Company
reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the Company Requisite Vote,
(v) if required by Law, or (vi) if the Company has provided a written notice
to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to Section 6.2(e) that it intends to make a
Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or take
action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal and the
deadline contemplated by Section 6.2(e) with respect to such notice has not
been reached. Subject to Section 6.2, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall recommend such adoption, shall include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit such adoption
of this Agreement.

 

6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

(a) _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt
of all comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any
request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence

that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence
mailing the Proxy Statement.

 

(b) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as

other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period, and to obtain all necessary
actions, nonactions, waivers, consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations that may be required, necessary or advisable to be obtained
from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any
Governmental Antitrust Entity) in order to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including under the HSR
Act, the ECMR and any other applicable Antitrust Law. The parties hereto agree
to use good faith efforts to cause the Closing to occur on or prior to
December 30, 2011, if practicable and subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the
foregoing, Parent and the Company each shall file the initial pre-merger
notifications with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein required under the HSR Act no later than 10 business days
after the date of this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall also make all
notifications, reports, applications or other filings, and take all
other actions, that may be reasonably necessary, proper or advisable, under
the ECMR and any other applicable Antitrust Law as soon as practicable;
_provided_ , that the parties will use reasonable best efforts to make such
notifications, reports, applications and other filings no later than 15
business days after the date of this Agreement and in any event will make all
initial (draft, where applicable) notifications, reports, applications and
other filings within 20 business days after the date of this Agreement. The
Company and Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period
with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act, the ECMR and any other
applicable Antitrust Law. Parent will not withdraw its initial filing
under the HSR Act, the ECMR or any other Antitrust Law, as the case may be,
and refile any of them, unless the Company has consented in advance to such
withdrawal and refiling. The Company and Parent shall not enter into any
agreement with a Governmental Entity (including any Governmental Antitrust
Entity) to extend any waiting period, or to delay or not to consummate the
Merger under the HSR Act, the ECMR or any other applicable Antitrust Law.
Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent
and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith the
views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating
to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. For purposes of

 



45  this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act,
the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the ECMR and all other Laws
that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(c) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Affiliates, directors, officers and shareholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
under the HSR Act, the ECMR and any other applicable Antitrust Law.

 

(d) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, or any of its Affiliates, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit
any of its Affiliates, officers or any other Representatives to participate
in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

(e) _Antitrust Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, without limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant
to this Section 6.5, each of the Company (in the case of clauses (i) and (iv)
of this Section 6.5(e) set forth below) and Parent (in all cases set forth
below) agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions:

 

(i) to provide any information, document or filing or any supplementary
information, document or filings reasonably requested or required by any
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of applicable Antitrust
Law (a " _Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") as promptly as practicable;

(ii) to cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry
or proceeding, judicial or administrative, including any proceeding initiated
by a Governmental Antitrust Entity or private party;

(iii) to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry or enactment of
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination, judgment, investigation or Law that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 



46 (iv) to contest, resist, defend and resolve any lawsuit or other legal
proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transaction contemplated by it, and in the event that
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or enacted, or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted, in any proceeding,
review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to use its reasonable
best efforts to take any and all steps (including the appeal thereof,
the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by this Section
6.5(e)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so as to permit

divesting, or otherwise conveying particular assets, categories, portions or

Governmental Antitrust Entity necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case, to the extent such action is reasonably
necessary to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened (x)
commencement of any investigation or proceeding in any forum or (y) issuance
or enactment of any order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law
that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by
any Governmental Antitrust Entity. All efforts described in this Section
6.5(e) shall not be qualified by reasonable best efforts and no actions taken
pursuant to clauses (A)-(D) of this paragraph shall be considered for purposes
of determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

6.6. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law (including any
applicable privacy and data security Law), from the date hereof throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and shall cause its

supplement any representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i)
to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality or (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (it being agreed that, in the event that the
restrictions of clauses (i) or (ii) apply, that the Company shall provide
Parent with a reasonably detailed description of the information not provided
and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to design and
implement alternative disclosure arrangements to enable Parent to evaluate
any such information without violating the applicable privilege or breaching
the Companys obligation to any third party). All requests for information

releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making

immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) employee benefits, including
cash-based bonus opportunities, that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) severance benefits that are no
less favorable than those set forth in Section 6.9(a) of the Company
Exceptions Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or
any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) be required to
take into account any equity compensation or bonus performance targets when
determining whether employee benefits are substantially comparable.

 

(b) Parent shall cause any of its employee benefit plans that the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries are entitled to participate in to take into
account for purposes of

 



48  eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual thereunder (other than any benefit

Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the same
extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits).

 

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor
thereto to, honor the Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations under the
agreements identified in Section 6.9(c) of the Company Exceptions Letter in

expense except, subject to the terms of this Agreement, (a) for
Parents reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 6.14(b) and (b) for
Parents indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 6.14(b).

6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees that
it will (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law), each current and former director and officer of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified
Parties service as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or services performed by such persons at the request of the Company or its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnified Party.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for
the extension of (i) the directors and officers liability coverage of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a
claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys insurance carriers as of the date hereof with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the
Companys existing policies with respect to any matter claimed against a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him
or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby), _provided_ that the cost thereof
does not exceed an amount (the " _Maximum Premium Amount_ ") equal to 300% of
the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance for the
2011-2012 policy year (which premium amount the Company represents and 

 



50  warrants is as set forth in Section 6.11 of the Company Exceptions Letter).
If the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for any reason
fail to obtain such insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least
as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys existing policies as
of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable commercial efforts
to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
to the insureds as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof with respect to any matter claimed against a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent
or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant
to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of the Maximum Premium
Amount; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Premium Amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium Amount.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
6.11.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, who are third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the articles
of incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All rights
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in the articles of incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement
between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of
any such Indemnified Party.

6.12. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that such 

 



51  transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. Neither the
Company nor its Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) shall take any
action to permit any Takeover Statute to become applicable to the Merger or
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.13. _Parent Vote_.

(a) Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or cause to be voted (or a
consent to be given with respect to) any Shares beneficially owned by it or
any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be
voted (or to provide a consent), in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at
any meeting of shareholders of the Company at which this Agreement shall
be submitted for adoption and at all adjournments or postponements thereof
(or, if applicable, by any action of shareholders of the Company by consent in
lieu of a meeting).

(b) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall
execute and deliver, in accordance with Article 7 of the NCBCA and in its
capacity as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, a written consent adopting
the Agreement.

6.14. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments and shall not permit
any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision
or remedy under the Financing Commitments if such amendment, modification or
waiver would (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including
by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the
Debt Financing or similar fee) unless the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount, or (y) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise
amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay (taking into
account the Marketing Period) or prevent the Closing, (II) make the funding of
the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing) less likely to occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, the ability of
Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood
of consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this Section 6.14 and provided that the
representations set forth in Section 5.2(e) shall be true and correct
giving effect to such replacement or amendment, Parent and Merger Sub may
replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof, if the
addition of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would
not be reasonably likely to (I) delay (taking into account the Marketing
Period) or prevent the Closing, (II) make the funding of the Debt Financing
(or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less
likely to occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements with

 



52  respect thereto, the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Section 6.14, references to
"Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments as permitted to be amended or modified by this Section 6.14(a) and
references to "Financing Commitments" or "Debt Financing Commitments" shall
include such documents as permitted to be amended or modified by this Section
6.14(a). Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full force and effect the Debt
Financing Commitments in accordance with their terms, (ii) satisfy all
conditions and covenants applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt
Financing Commitments (including by consummating the financing pursuant to
the terms of the Equity Financing Commitments) and otherwise comply with its
obligations thereunder, in each case, that are within Parents or any of its
Affiliates control, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments or on such terms acceptable to
Parent and the Financing Sources, (iv) consummate the Financing at
the Closing, (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitments and
(vi) subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitments, cause the lenders and other Persons providing
Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing contemplated to be funded
on the Closing Date by the Debt Financing Commitments (or such lesser amount
as may be required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice: (A) of any
material breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any material breach or default) by any party to any Financing Commitment or
definitive document related to the Financing of which Parent or its Affiliates
becomes aware; (B) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Person with respect to any actual or potential breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment
or any definitive document related to the Financing or any provisions of
the Financing Commitments or any definitive document related to the
Financing; and (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good
faith it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the
terms or in the manner contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the
definitive documents related to the Financing; _provided_ , that in no event
will Parent or Merger Sub be under any obligation to disclose any information
that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent and Merger
Sub shall have used their reasonable best efforts to disclose such information
in a way that would not waive such privilege. As soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within three business days after the date the
Company delivers Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to
any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately
preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on substantially the terms and conditions (including the flex conditions)
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and conditions that are no less favorable to
Parent (taking into account any flex provisions) than those set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitment, in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event but no later than the last business day
of the Marketing Period.

 



53 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the
first period of 18 consecutive business days after the date of this Agreement
throughout which (A) Parent shall have the Essential Marketing Information,
during which period such information shall remain compliant in all material
respects at all times with the applicable provisions of Regulation S-X and
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, and (B) the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature can only by satisfied at Closing) and nothing has
occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.2 to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be
scheduled for any time during the 18 consecutive business days of such
period; _provided_ that such 18 consecutive day period shall be reduced to 15
consecutive business days if Parent shall have the Essential Marketing
Information at least three (3) business days prior to the commencement of
such 15 consecutive day period and such information shall remain compliant in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of Regulation S-X and
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, at all times during such consecutive
15 business day period; _provided, further_ , that if the Marketing Period has
not ended on or prior to November 22, 2011 and would otherwise include
November 23, 2011, November 24, 2011 or November 25, 2011, it shall not be
required to be consecutive solely to the extent it would include November 23,
2011, November 24, 2011 or November 25, 2011 and the Marketing Period will be
extended by the number of days in such period that would otherwise be
included in the Marketing Period; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to December 19, 2011, the Marketing
Period shall not be deemed to have commenced prior to January 4, 2012 for any
purpose hereunder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if not reduced to 15
consecutive business days as provided above, such 18 consecutive business day
period will be reduced to 16 consecutive business days if such 16 consecutive
business day period begins on or after November 28, 2011 and is completed on
or before December 19, 2011, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Marketing
Period shall not be deemed to have commenced if, (w) prior to the completion
of the Marketing Period, Deloitte and Touche LLP shall have withdrawn its audit
opinion with respect to any financial statements contained in the Company
Reports or the Essential Marketing Information, (x) the financial statements
included in the Essential Marketing Information that is available to Parent on
the first day of the Marketing Period would not be sufficiently current on any
day during such period to satisfy the requirements of Rule 3-12 of Regulation
S-X to permit a registration statement using such financial statements to be
declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such period, in which case
the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence until receipt by Parent
of updated Essential Marketing Information that would be required under Rule
3-12 of Regulation S-X to permit a registration statement using such financial
statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such new 18
consecutive business day period, (y) prior to completion of the Marketing
Period, the Company has issued a public statement indicating its intent to
restate the historical financial statements of the Company or that any such
restatement is under consideration or may be a possibility, in which case the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence until such restatement has
been completed and the relevant Company Report or Company Reports have been
amended or the Company has announced that it has concluded that no
restatement shall be required under GAAP or (z) the Company has been
delinquent in filing any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or any Annual Report on
Form 10-K, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence
unless or until such delinquencies have been cured; _provided_ that the
Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date

 



54  that is the date on which the Debt Financing otherwise is obtained. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Essential Marketing Information_ " shall mean,
as of any date, (i) such financial statements, financial data and other
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries of the type required in
Registration Statements on Form S-1 by SEC Regulation S-X and SEC Regulation
S-K under the Securities Act (including pro forma financial information,
_provided_ that it is understood that assumptions underlying the pro forma
adjustments to be made are the responsibility of the Parent) for registered
offerings of non-convertible debt securities, to the extent the same is of
the type and form customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A
under the Securities Act to consummate the offering of secured or unsecured
senior notes and/or senior subordinated notes (including, even if not
required by SEC Regulation S-X or SEC Regulation S-K under the Securities Act,
pro forma and other financial data for the pertinent last twelve month
periods), made on any date during the relevant period, and (ii) (A) such other
information required by Sections 5 and 10 of Exhibit D to the Debt Financing
Commitment, including such information and data as are otherwise necessary in
order to receive customary "comfort" letters with respect to the financial
statements and data referred to in clause (i) of this definition (including
"negative assurance" comfort) from the independent auditors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries on any date during the relevant period and (B) drafts of
such "comfort" letters which such auditors are prepared to issue upon
completion of customary procedures, each in form and substance customary for
high yield debt securities offerings; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Company shall in good faith reasonably believe it has delivered the Essential
Marketing Information, it may deliver to Parent a written notice to that
effect (stating when it believes it completed such delivery), in which case
the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced on the date specified
in that notice unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes the Company has
not completed delivery of the Essential Marketing Information and, within
three business days of the delivery of such notice by the Company, delivers a
written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with specificity which
Essential Marketing Information that Parent reasonably believes the Company
has not delivered). Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing.

Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Merger
Sub, at Parents sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent
that is necessary in connection with the Debt Financing, including (i)
furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing Sources the Essential
Marketing Information and such other financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (ii)

respect to presence or absence of material non-public information and the
accuracy of the information contained therein), rating agency presentations
and lender presentations relating to the Debt Financing, (iv) cooperating with
the marketing efforts of Parent and its Financing Sources for all or any
portion of the Debt Financing, (v) providing and executing documents as may
be reasonably requested by Parent, including (A) documents requested by the

indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries and the release of
related liens, including customary payoff letters and (to the extent
required) evidence that notice of such repayment has been timely delivered to

Financing Sources, (vi) executing and delivering any pledge and security
documents and otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral, (vii) using
reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent set forth in the

investigation, to the extent customary and reasonable and not unreasonably
interfering with the business of the Company and (ix) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters and legal opinions
reasonably requested by Parent and customary for financings similar to the
Financing, including issuing any customary representations letters to Deloitte
and Touche, LLP; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (a) irrespective of the above,
no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
certificate, document or instrument (other than the authorization and
representation letters referred to above) shall be effective until the
Effective Time and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any action under any certificate, document or instrument that
is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any agreement
that is effective before the Effective Time) or that would be effective prior
to the Effective Time, (b) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to
the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, and (c) none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to issue any offering or information
document. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to

with the Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
(including any action taken in accordance with this Section 6.14(b)) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries provided by the
Company in writing specifically for use in the Financing offering
documents). Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-

 



56  pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with
this Section 6.14(b). The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that
such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably
likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) Except with respect to a lead debt agent, in no event shall Parent or any
of its Affiliates prohibit any bank or investment bank or other potential
provider of debt or equity financing not affiliated with Parent or the
Guarantors, excluding the Companys financial advisors, from providing
financing or financial advisory services to any Person in connection with
a transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the
Confidentiality Agreements is hereby amended to (i) include in the definition
of "Representatives" contained therein (A) all affiliated funds of the
Guarantors and their respective limited partners, institutional investors with
whom the Guarantors have existing relationships (provided such investors are
not primarily engaged in the private equity business) and debt financing
sources and (B) effective from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, all
other prospective equity investors, co-investors and equity financing sources
of Parent and its members and its and their respective affiliates and their
respective agents, advisors and representatives; _provided_ that any such
Person is not engaged in a Competing Business and does not beneficially own in
excess of 10% of the outstanding voting stock or other voting equity
securities of any Person engaged in a Competing Business and (ii) permit
Parent and any lead debt agent to agree that such Financing Sources will not
provide any financing to any Person (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries)
in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The execution of this Agreement shall constitute written consent
by the Company pursuant to each of the Confidentiality Agreements to all
actions by Parent, Merger Sub, the members of Parent and their respective
affiliates permitted or contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Carlyle
Investment Management, L.L.C. and Hellman and Friedman Advisors LLC is an
express, intended third party beneficiary of each waiver to, or amendment of,
the Confidentiality Agreements contained herein.

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing
or any alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII and the limitations on remedies set forth
in this Agreement, including Section 8.5 and Section 9.5.

57 6.17. _Shareholder Litigation_. In the event that any shareholder litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated

against the Company and/or the members of the Board of Directors of the
Company prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent
and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof.
The Company shall reasonably consult with Parent with respect to the defense
or settlement of any such shareholder litigation. Neither the Company nor any

an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding any such shareholder litigation or consent to the same
unless Parent shall have consented in writing (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

6.18. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions
of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to

Company Exceptions Letter, such cooperation need not require the payment of
any dividend prior to the Effective Time and (y) except as set forth in
Section 6.20 of the Company Exceptions Letter, any such transfer of Offshore
Cash may be made and held in the currency of the transferring entity;
provided that such Offshore Cash is exchanged for an equivalent amount in U.S.
dollars and held in U.S-dollar denominated bank accounts of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the purposes of this Section
6.20, " _Offshore Cash_ " means cash and cash equivalents that (prior to the
Repatriation) are held outside the United States by one or more Subsidiaries
of the Company

 

(b) Without limiting Section 6.20(a), without the prior written approval of

delayed), the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
knowingly take any action, or knowingly permit any action to be taken, except
in each case in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices, that (i) increases or would reasonably be expected to increase in
any material respect the amount of any Taxes, or other costs or expenses,
incurred or to be incurred in connection with the Repatriation or (ii)
restrains, delays or hinders, or would reasonably be expected to restrain,

the Company will determine in good faith the fair market value of the
Applicable Securities as of September 30, 2011 to be used for the purpose of
preparing the Companys consolidated financial statements for the quarterly
period ended September 30, 2011, which determination shall be made in
accordance with GAAP and the past practices of the Company in determining such
valuation for the purpose of preparing the consolidated quarterly financial
statements of the Company for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 (the fair
market value of the Applicable Securities as of September 30, 2011, as so
determined, the _"Applicable Securities Deemed Fair Value"_ ), and provide
Parent written notice of such determination and (c) at the request of Parent,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, sell all or part of
the Applicable Securities held by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
date of this Agreement at a price equal to or greater than the price

to determine a price that is reasonably satisfactory to Parent on which the
Applicable Securities may be sold; _provided, further_ , that the Company
shall not be required to comply with a request from Parent to sell Applicable

have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 and (iii) the Company stood ready,
willing and able to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
on that date and the Company had given Parent written notice on or prior to

pursuant to Section 1.2, no party shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(a).

 



62 8.4. _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by written notice of

Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) fails to publicly reaffirm

would not be satisfied and such breach cannot be or is not cured prior to the
earlier of (i) 25 calendar days after written notice thereof is given by
Parent to the Company and (ii) the date that is three business days prior to
the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent is not then in

8.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the

no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto (or
of any Company Related Party or of any Parent Related Party); _provided_ ,

that (i) except as otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall (A)
relieve any party hereto of any liability to pay the Termination Fee or

Company of any liability for, subject to Section 8.5(d)(vi), damages incurred
by any Parent Related Party resulting from a Willful Breach of this Agreement
by the Company and (ii) the agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub

provisions of Section 6.14(b) (Financing), this Section 8.5 and Article IX,
and, subject to their terms, the Confidentiality Agreements and the
Guarantees, shall survive the termination of this Agreement. As used herein, "
_Willful Breach_ " shall mean a breach of any material representation,
warranty or covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement that is a
consequence of an act or failure to act by or on behalf of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with the actual knowledge (which shall be deemed to
include knowledge of facts that a Person acting reasonably should have) that
the taking of such act or failure to take such act would, or would reasonably
be expected to, represent or cause a breach of this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that:

(i) (x) before obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (the section relating to the Termination
Date) or Section 8.2(b) (the section relating to failure to receive
shareholder approval), (y) any Person shall have made, or publicly disclosed
or announced, an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement but
prior to such termination and (z) within 12 months after such termination the
Company shall

 



63  have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is consummated ( _provided_ that for
purposes of this clause (z) the references to "20%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%");

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to (x) Section 8.4(a)
(the section relating to a Change of Recommendation) or (y) Section 8.4(b)
(the section relating to a failure to reaffirm a Company Recommendation);

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a)
(the section relating to an Alternative Acquisition Agreement); or

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(c) as a
result of a knowing and willful material breach of this Agreement by the
Company;

then the Company shall (A) in the case of clause (i) above, within one
business day after the date on which the Company consummates the Acquisition
Proposal referred to in subclause (i)(z) above, (B) in the case of clause (ii)
or clause (iv), no later than four business days after the date of such
termination, (C) in the case of clause (iii) above, immediately prior to or
substantially concurrently with (and in any event on the same business day as)
such termination, pay to (i) Carlyle Investment Management, L.L.C. ("
_Carlyle_ ") or its designee 59.4% of the Termination Fee (as defined below)
and (ii) Hellman and Friedman, L.P. (together with Carlyle, the " _Sponsors_ ")
or its designee 40.6% of the Termination Fee, in each case, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds (it being understood that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion). "
_Termination Fee_ " shall mean (x) an amount equal to $58,101,463 if the
Termination Fee becomes payable (1) in connection with termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) and the other party to the Alternative
Acquisition Agreement referred to in Section 8.3(a) is an Excluded Party, (2)
in connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(a)
in a circumstance in which the event giving rise to the right of termination
is based on the submission of an Acquisition Proposal by an Excluded Party or
(3) if the party who consummates the Acquisition Proposal referred to in
Section 8.5(b)(i) in connection with a termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a)
or 8.2(b), is an Excluded Party, and (y) an amount equal to $116,202,925 in
all other circumstances.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to:

(i) Section 8.3(b) (the section relating to material breach by Parent or
Merger Sub); or

 

(ii) Section 8.3(c) (the section relating to failure to consummate on the
Closing Date specified by Section 1.2);

 

then Parent shall (A) promptly, but in no event later than four business days
after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company an
amount (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ ") equal to $251,773,004 minus any
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to Section
6.14(b) (and amounts previously paid in respect thereof), (B) reimburse the
Company for the aggregate amount of reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and

 



64  expenses, including Taxes, incurred by the Company in connection with its
compliance with Section 6.20 (the " _Repatriation Expense Reimbursement
Obligation_ ") and (C) if the Company has sold Applicable Securities in
accordance with the written request of Parent pursuant to Section 6.21 in
compliance with Section 6.21, pay or cause to be paid to the Company an amount
equal to the excess (if any) of (1) the Applicable Securities Deemed Fair
Value (or, if less than all of the Applicable Securities were sold in
compliance with Section 6.21 in accordance with the written request of Parent
pursuant to Section 6.21, the portion of the Applicable Securities Deemed
Fair Value attributable to the Applicable Securities so sold in compliance
with Section 6.21), over (2) the aggregate proceeds realized by the Company
and its Subsidiaries from the sale of Applicable Securities effected in
compliance with Section 6.21 in accordance the written request of Parent
pursuant to Section 6.21 (such amount, the " _ARS Reimbursement Obligation_
"), in each case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, within
three business days of the Companys written request to Parent therefor (it
being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Reverse
Termination Fee on more than one occasion).

 

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to Section 8.5(b), or Parent fails to promptly pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 8.5(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, either
or both Sponsors, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount
set forth in Section 8.5(b) or any portion thereof or a judgment against
Parent for the amount set forth in Section 8.5(c) or any portion thereof, the
Company shall pay to the Sponsors, on the one hand, or Parent shall pay to the
Company, on the other hand, its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount or
portion thereof at the prime rate of Barclays Bank PLC in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereto
expressly acknowledge and agree that:

8.5(c) (including its rights to enforce the Guarantees with respect thereto),
the Repatriation Expense Reimbursement Obligation and the ARS Reimbursement
Obligation, any reimbursement and expense obligations of Parent pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 8.5(d) and the Companys right to specific

former, current, or future general or limited partners, direct or indirect
shareholders or equityholders, managers, members, directors, officers,

Related Parties"_ ) for any loss, cost, damage or expense suffered with
respect to this Agreement, the Guarantees, the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (including any breach by Parent or Merger Sub), the
termination of this Agreement, the failure of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be consummated or any breach of this Agreement by Parent
or Merger Sub,

 



65  and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Parent Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation to the Company (other than pursuant
to the Confidentiality Agreements) relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or
actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or
failure;

 

(ii) In light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with
respect to the foregoing, upon any such termination of this Agreement, the

or Merger Sub, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any claims or actions
under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure);
_provided_ , _however_ , this Section 8.5(d)(ii) shall not limit the right of
the parties hereto to specific performance of this Agreement pursuant to, and
subject to the limitations in, Section 9.5(c) prior to the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms;

(iii) In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek or obtain any
recovery or judgment in excess of the Reverse Termination Fee (plus, in the
case the Reverse Termination Fee and Repatriation Expense Reimbursement
Obligation and ARS Reimbursement Obligation is not timely paid, the amounts
described in the first sentence of this Section 8.5(d)) plus the Repatriation

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF
THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER LAW, EXCEPT THAT, TO THE
EXTENT REQUIRED BY THE NCBCA, THE MERGER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF

to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or

inconvenient forum or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate, or that
this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such Chosen
Courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims relating to
such action, suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Chosen
Courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such Chosen Court

Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process
or other papers in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding in
the manner provided in Section 9.6 or in such other manner as may be

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY

PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING THOSE CONTEMPLATED BY SECTION 9.5(d)). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY

THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) SUCH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in
order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision hereof to the contrary, it is explicitly
agreed that the Company shall not be entitled to any specific performance,
injunction or other equitable relief requiring Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger under this Agreement or cause the Equity Financing to
be funded, except that the Company may seek specific performance of Parents
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger and
of Parent and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger if and only in
the event that (i) all conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing but which conditions, at the time that the Company seeks such
specific performance pursuant to this Section 9.5(c), are capable of being
satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time), (ii) the Debt Financing
(or, if alternative financing is being used in accordance with Section 6.14,

Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent and the providers of
the Debt Financing that if specific performance is granted and the Equity
Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing pursuant to Article

will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief permitted by this Agreement on the basis that (x) the other
party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
in accordance with this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond
or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort

severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction; _provided_ that, the
parties intend that the remedies and limitations thereon (including
limitations on the right to specifically enforce the terms hereof) shall be
construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such remedies
and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases the
liability of any party (or the liability of any Financing Source Party) or any
of its shareholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees or agents, or obligations hereunder or under the Guarantees.

9.13.  _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and headings

provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section,
Exhibit, Schedule or Annex, such reference shall be to a Section of or
Exhibit, Schedule or Annex to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." All pronouns and all variations thereof shall be deemed to refer
to the masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the identity of
the Person may require. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to any
agreement (including this Agreement), contract, statute or regulation, such
references are to, except as context may otherwise require, the agreement,
contract, statute or regulation as amended, modified, supplemented, restated
or replaced from time to time (in the case of an agreement or contract, to the
extent permitted by the terms thereof); and to any section of any statute or
regulation including any successor to the section and, in the case of any
statute, any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder. All references to

interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly

disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



73 (c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
exceptions letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in an exceptions letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation
of law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Closing,
Parent may assign its rights under this Agreement (and transfer and convey the
capital stock of Merger Sub) to one or more affiliates or designees of Parent
or designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct
or indirect Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub,
in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references
to such other Subsidiary;  _provided_ that any such assignment or designation
shall not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder or otherwise
materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this
Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

 



74 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement and Plan of Merger has been duly executed
and delivered by the duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the
date first written above.
