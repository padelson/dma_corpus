any of the Companies or may be prepared or compiled by the Seller or any of
the Companies without undue burden. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Seller shall not be required to disclose any information to
Buyer if such disclosure would, in Sellers sole discretion: (i) jeopardize
any attorney-client or other privilege; or (ii) contravene any applicable
Legal Requirement. Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of
Seller, which may be withheld for any reason, Buyer shall not contact any

in accordance with Prudent Industry Practice;

 



 

(b) use its Reasonable Best Efforts to preserve intact the current business
organization of such Acquired Entity, maintain its rights and ongoing

Seller will promptly notify Buyer in writing if Seller becomes aware of any
fact or condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of Sellers or
any Acquired Entitys representations and warranties as of the date of this
Agreement or if the Seller becomes aware of the occurrence after the date of
this Agreement and before the Closing Date of any fact or condition that would
(except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a
breach of any such representation or warranty had such representation or
warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or
condition. Should any such fact or condition require any change in the Seller
Disclosure Letter, if the Seller Disclosure Letter were dated the date of the
occurrence or discovery of any such fact or condition, Seller will promptly
deliver to Buyer a supplement to the Seller Disclosure Letter specifying such
change; provided, that no such notification or supplement shall be taken into

(a) in existence as of the date hereof, or (b) resulting from a breach of any
covenant of Seller or any Company pursuant to this Agreement. Between the date
of this Agreement and the Closing Date, each Acquired Entity and each Seller

pursuant to Article IX, neither any Acquired Entity nor any Seller shall, or
cause any Acquired Entity or any of their Representatives to, directly or
indirectly solicit, initiate, or encourage any inquiries or proposals from,
discuss or negotiate with, provide any non-public information to, or consider
the merits of any unsolicited inquiries or proposals from, any Person (other
than Buyer) relating to any transaction involving the sale of the business or
Assets (other than in the

 



      
 

 



 

Ordinary Course of Business) of Acquired Entity, or any of the membership
interest in any Acquired Entity, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination, or similar transaction involving any Acquired Entity.

 



 

5.7 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Seller and each Acquired Entity will use their Reasonable Best
Efforts to cause the conditions in Article VII to be satisfied.

 



 

5.8 _Protection of Relationships_. Except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, no Party will directly or indirectly at any time prior to, on, or
after the Closing Date take, and they and each of them will cause each
Acquired Entity not to take, any action that is designed or intended to have
the effect of discouraging any offtaker, lessor, licensor, customer, supplier
or other business associate of Acquired Entity from establishing or
maintaining business relationships with any Acquired Entity.

Best Efforts to implement the provisions of this Agreement, and for such
purpose Seller and each Acquired Entity, at the request of Buyer, at or after
the Closing, shall, without further consideration, promptly execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Buyer such documents and
other instruments in addition to those required by this Agreement, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and take all such other actions,
as Buyer may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to implement any provision
of this Agreement and/or to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and
obtain the benefit thereof for Buyer. Neither Seller nor any Acquired Entity
shall take any action to terminate or limit existing or prior insurance
coverages as applicable to the pre-closing activities of any Acquired Entity
or any Acquired Entitys ability to make claims under those insurance
coverages. On the Closing Date Buyer, through its acquisition of the

Acquired Persons have over such Assets, and Seller will cease to have any
control of such Assets.

Agreement, Seller agrees that:

 



 

(a) During the Non-Compete Term and with respect to the Non-Compete Regions
(each as defined below):

 



 

(i) No Seller will, either directly or indirectly, whether as shareholder,

participate in the ownership, management, operation, financing, or control of,
or be employed by any Person where such Person is engaged in the acquisition,
operation, ownership or control of solar power systems and solar power
projects or related projects for the production and sale of solar power
(collectively, the " _Competing Projects_ "; _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the manufacture and sale of materials used in the
manufacture of solar power systems or the trading of renewable energy credits
shall not be considered Competing Projects) _._ Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller may purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, up to (but
not more than) 20% of any class

 



       
 

 



 

of securities of any enterprise if Seller does not Control such enterprise.

Seller, or (D) induce or attempt to induce any offtaker, customer, supplier,
licensee, or other business relationship of any Acquired Entity to cease
doing, or decrease, business with any Acquired Entity, or in any way interfere
with the relationship between any Acquired Entity and any client or customer,
supplier, licensee, or business relation of any Acquired Entity, provided in
the event that any Acquired Entity or Buyer or Buyers parent is acquired
(whether by sale of stock, sale of all or substantially all of its assets or
by merger) by a third party, the obligations of Seller hereunder shall apply
only with respect to the Competing Projects and shall not be deemed by
operation of such acquisition to include other products and services of such
third party that are not Competing Projects. Nothing herein shall limit the
right of Seller or any other Person to publish notices for or advertisements
of available employment in newspapers, on the internet or in other
publications or media of general circulation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Section 5.10(a)(ii) shall not (x) apply to any activity conducted by
Borrego Solar Systems, LLC (including its Subsidiaries, successors and assigns
or (y) prevent Seller and its Related Persons from engaging in family
businesses with Key Employees, so long as such activities do not interrupt the
businesses of Buyer or any Acquired Entity or conflict with the fiduciary
duties such individuals may owe to Buyer or any Acquired Entity or their
Affiliates, their respective equity holders or others as members of the board
or as officers of Buyer or any Acquired Entity or their Affiliates).

the business of the Acquired Entities.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Non-Compete Term_ " shall mean,
with respect to Seller, the period commencing on the date of this Agreement
and ending five (5) years thereafter and the " _Non-Compete Region_ " shall
mean the United States, including State of California, the State of New
Jersey, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

 



      
 

 



 

5.11 _Confidentiality Agreement of Seller_. Seller acknowledges and agrees
that all Confidential Information regarding each Acquired Entity and the Buyer
known or obtained by Seller, whether before or after the date hereof, is the
property, as appropriate, of any Acquired Entity or Buyer. Therefore, Seller
agrees that it will not, at any time, disclose or cause to be disclosed to any
unauthorized Persons or use or cause to be used for his own account or for the
benefit of any third party (other than any Acquired Entity) any Confidential
Information regarding any Acquired Entity and the Buyer, whether Seller has
such information in Sellers memory or embodied in writing or other physical
form or any computer readable format, without Buyers written consent, unless
and to the extent that disclosure is required by law, regulation or the rules
of any stock exchange or similar entity (in which event Seller shall give
Buyer as much notice of such disclosure as is practicable and permitted by law
and shall cooperate with Buyer to obtain appropriate protective orders). Each
Seller agrees to deliver to Buyer at any other time Buyer may request, all
documents, memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, summaries and other
documentation, models, components, devices, or computer software, whether
embodied in a disk or in other form (and all copies of all of the foregoing),
relating to the businesses, operations, or affairs of each Acquired Entity and
any other Confidential Information regarding each Acquired Entity that Seller
may then possess or have under Sellers control.

provisions of Sections 5.10 and 5.11 shall cause immediate and irreparable
harm to Buyer. In the event any Seller breaches or threatens to breach any of
said provisions, Seller agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to the entry of
preliminary and permanent injunctive or other equitable relief by a court of
competent jurisdiction to restrain Seller from any violation or threatened
violation of such provisions and compelling Seller to comply with such
provisions, it being agreed that money damages alone would be inadequate to
compensate Buyer and would be an inadequate remedy for such breach. This
Section 5.12 shall not affect or limit, and the injunctive relief provided in
this Section 5.12 shall be in addition to, any other remedies available to
Buyer at law or in equity or in arbitration for any such violation by any
Seller, including the right to recover Damages as provided in Article X.

Seller shall assist Buyer in preparing consolidated Financial Statements as of

things as reasonably requested, in each case, solely for the purpose of
carrying out the intent of this Section 5.13.

herein as the " _Firstar Pre-Closing Indemnity Obligations_ ").

and their respective Affiliates for any Damages incurred by any such Person
arising out of or in connection with Borregos performance of its obligations

(c) Seller acknowledges that Buyer has had limited time to conduct its

reimbursement or any other remedy based upon Sellers representations,
warranties, covenants and other obligations of Seller shall not be affected by
such investigation conducted with respect to the Companies or the Assets or
any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether
before or after execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such

obligation of such Company in this Agreement required to be performed prior to

(Taxes), 3.11 (Employee Matters), 3.12 (Compliance with Legal Requirements),

total of all Damages under such Section 10.2(i) for which an indemnification
payment is required by Seller exceeds $250,000 (the " _Deductible_ "),
provided that, for purposes of calculating Damages, any qualification
regarding materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar phrase shall be
disregarded; and, provided further, that if the total of all Damages exceeds
$250,000, Seller shall pay to Buyer the full amount of such Damages that
exceeds the Deductible. Claims with respect to each of Sections 3.3
(Capitalization), 3.7 (Condition and Sufficiency of Assets), 3.23
(Subsidiaries), 4.1 (Organization and Good Standing), 4.2 (Authority; No
Conflict), 4.3 (Investment Intent), the Firstar Pre-Closing Indemnity

under this Article X shall not be limited by any cap.

 



 

(b) Payment of all Claims under Section 10.2 shall be paid first from the
proceeds of the Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement and thereafter jointly and severally by Seller.

 



 

(c) To the extent not paid to Buyer or Buyer Indemnified Persons in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the proceeds of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be paid to Seller upon the twelve (12)
month anniversary of the date hereof, provided that, in the event there exists
any outstanding Claim against such proceeds in excess of the Deductible (if
applicable), the amount of such Claim shall not be paid

 



       
 

 



 

to Seller until and to the extent that such Claim has been resolved in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and any balance of the Escrow Amount
remains for distribution to Seller. The proceeds of the Major Maintenance
Escrow Amount shall, to the extent not paid to Buyer or any Acquired Entity in
accordance with Section 12.15, remain in the Escrow Account until the twelve
(12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, at which time any portion of the
Major Maintenance Escrow Amount that remains in the Escrow Account shall be
paid to Seller.

 



 

10.6 _Procedure for Indemnification; Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified Party under Section 10.2, or 10.3
of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against it, such indemnified
Party will, if a Claim is to be made against an indemnifying Party under such
Section, give written notice to the indemnifying Party of the commencement of
such Claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying Party will not relieve
the indemnified Party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified
Party, except to the extent that the indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced
by the indemnified Partys failure to give such notice.

 



 

(b) If any Proceeding referred to in Section 10.6(a) is brought against an
indemnified Party and it gives notice to the indemnifying Party of the
commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying Party will be entitled to
assume (at its own cost and expense, regardless of the ultimate outcome of
such Proceeding) the defense of such Proceeding with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified Party and, after notice from the indemnifying
Party to the indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such
Proceeding, the indemnifying Party will not, as long as it diligently conducts
such defense, be liable to the indemnified Party under this Article X for any
fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of
such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the indemnified Party
in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other than reasonable costs
of investigation. If the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Proceeding, (i) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by
the indemnifying Party without the indemnified Partys consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless (A) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or any violation of the
rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the indemnified Party, and (B) the sole relief or agreement or
commitment made is payment of monetary damages, which are paid in full by the
indemnifying Party, and (ii) the indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
full amount of monetary Damages to the indemnified Party, without regard to
any limitation that otherwise might apply pursuant to Section 10.5(a). If
notice is given to an indemnifying Party of the commencement of any Proceeding
and the indemnifying Party does not, within 15 business days after the
indemnified Partys notice is given, give notice to the indemnified Party of
its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnified Party
shall be entitled to assume such defense; _provided_ that the indemnified
Party shall not effect any compromise or settlement of such Proceeding without
the prior written consent of the indemnifying Party (which may not be
unreasonably withheld). If the indemnified Party assumes the defense of any
Proceedings for any reason, the indemnified Party shall conduct such defense
with the same care that a reasonably prudent and sophisticated business person
would use if it were financially responsible for the outcome of such
Proceedings.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified Party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may adversely
affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for
which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the
indemnified Party may, by notice to the indemnifying Party, participate in the
defense of such proceeding and the reasonable costs and expenses of such
participation shall be paid by the indemnifying Party.

 



 

(d) Seller hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court in
which a Proceeding is brought against any indemnified Party for purposes of
any claim that an indemnified Party may have under this Agreement with respect
to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein by a third party, and agree
that process may be served on Seller with respect to such a claim anywhere in
the world.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall
not settle any Tax-related Proceeding without Sellers prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if
the resolution of such Proceeding reasonably could be expected to adversely
affect the Tax liability or Tax attributes of Seller, its Affiliates or any of
the Assets for any Pre-Closing Period, including the pre-Closing portion of
any Straddle Period.

 



 

10.7 _Procedure for Indemnification; Other Claims_. A Claim for any matter not
involving a third party claim may be asserted by notice to the Party from whom
indemnification is sought, subject to the jurisdiction provisions of this
Agreement.

 



 

10.8 _Subrogation_. Upon making an indemnity payment pursuant to this
Agreement, the indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the indemnified Party against any third party
(other than, in any case where a Seller is the indemnifying Party, any rights
Buyer might have against Company or a Subsidiary) in respect of the damages to
which the payment related.

 



 

10.9 _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Party shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any
provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such Party or any of
its Affiliates has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any
other provision of this Agreement, the Exhibits, the Seller Disclosure Letter
or the Schedules attached hereto.

 



 

10.10 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments Between the Parties_. Unless otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements, all indemnification payments shall
constitute adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, and no
Party shall take any position inconsistent with such characterization.

 



 

10.11 _Exclusive Remedies_. Following Closing, the remedies provided for in
this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties and
their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, Affiliates, agents,
representatives, successors and assigns for any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered at Closing; provided, however, that nothing herein

 



      
 

 



 

(including, without limitation, in Article X) is intended to waive or limit
any claims for fraud or willful breach or waive or limit any equitable
remedies to which a Party may be entitled.

 



 

10.12 _Use of Insurance, etc_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in the event any Damages related to a claim by Buyer under this
Agreement are covered by insurance, Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek recovery under such insurance and the amount of
Damages incurred by Buyer for purposes of this Agreement shall be reduced by
the amount Buyer recovers from any insurer (net of any costs of collecting
such insurance payment, including the amount of any co-payment or deductible)
and Buyer shall refund amounts received from Seller up to the amount of
indemnification actually received for any such Damages; provided that the
filing of a claim with any insurer for such Damages shall not delay (or prior
to receipt of an amount from an insurer, reduce) any payment due to Buyer
under this Article X.

 



 

10.13 _Mitigation_. Each Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any loss, liability or damage which forms the basis of any claim
hereunder.

 



 

10.14 _No Consequential Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE
CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR
CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (UNLESS PAYABLE TO A THIRD
PARTY), SUCH AS, BYWAY OF EXAMPLE AND NOT OF LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS
OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS LOSSES.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI TAX MATTERS**

 



 

11.1 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for the timely payment of Transfer
Taxes, if any, arising out of or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall prepare and file when due all
necessary documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes
and, if required by applicable Legal Requirements, Seller shall and shall
cause its Affiliates to join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for fifty percent (50%) of
such Transfer Taxes within ten (10) days after Buyer submits a written request

(a) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by any Acquired Entity
for taxable years or periods ending on or before the applicable Closing Date,
in a manner consistent with past practice except to the extent otherwise
required by law. Seller shall timely remit, or cause to be timely remitted,
all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns to the relevant Governmental
Body, to the extent not paid at or before the Closing or taken into account in
determining the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to this
Agreement).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by each Acquired Entity
for taxable years or periods beginning on or before, and ending after the
applicable Closing Date (the " _Straddle Period_ "). All such Tax Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice except to the
extent otherwise required by law. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the
due date for filing of each such Tax Return (or such shorter period as the
circumstances require, but only in the case of a non-income Tax Return), Buyer
shall provide Seller with a draft copy of such Tax Return for its review and
comment, and Buyer shall include, in the Tax Return filed, all reasonable
comments provided by Seller with respect to any such draft copy not later than
five (5) days prior to such due date. Buyer and Seller agree to consult and
promptly resolve to the extent possible in good faith any issue arising as a
result of Sellers review of such Tax Returns. Buyer shall timely remit, or
cause to be timely remitted, all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns (as
determined pursuant to this Section 11.2(b)) to the relevant Governmental
Body.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall not amend, file, refile or otherwise modify, or cause or
permit to be amended, filed, refiled or otherwise modified, any Tax Return or
Tax election of any Acquired Entity or the Assets with respect to a Pre-
Closing Period (including the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period)
without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

11.3 _Straddle Period Tax Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) Upon the written request of Buyer setting forth in detail the computation
of the amount owed, Seller shall pay to Buyer, no later than three (3) days
prior to the due date for the applicable Tax Return, the Taxes for which
Seller is liable pursuant to this Agreement but which are payable with any Tax
Return to be filed by Buyer pursuant to Section 11.2(b).

 



 

(b) Where it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to apportion between
Seller and Buyer the Taxes of or with respect to each Acquired Entity or the
Assets for a Straddle Period, such liability shall be apportioned between the
period deemed to end at the close of the applicable Closing Date and the
period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the applicable
Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books, except that non-
income and other similar Taxes (such as real or personal property Taxes)
imposed on a periodic basis shall be allocated on a daily basis.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Section 11.3, any exemption, deduction, credit or
other item that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the
portion of the Straddle Period on a daily basis.

 



 

11.4 _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the applicable Closing Date, (i)
Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) assist Seller in preparing any
Tax Returns that Seller is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance
with Sections 11.1 and 11.2, (ii) Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates
to) assist Buyer in preparing any Tax Returns that Buyer is responsible for
preparing and filing in accordance with Sections 11.1 and 11.2, and (iii)
Buyer and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to)
reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits of, or disputes or
Proceedings with any Governmental Body regarding, any Tax Returns by or with
respect to the Acquired Entities, including making available to each other all

 



      
 

 



 

records necessary in connect therewith. The Parties agree to timely sign and
deliver such Tax Returns, documents and forms as may be reasonably necessary
or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce) any Tax
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and timely
provide the other Party with powers of attorney or similar authorizations as
may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section 11.4.

 



 

11.5 _Audits_. Buyer shall notify the Seller regarding, and within ten (10)
days after, the receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of notice of any
inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes
of or with respect to Company or a Company Subsidiary to the extent relating
to any taxable year or period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
applicable Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Period_ "). Buyer shall control any
Pre-Closing Period Contest, provided that Buyer shall take no action to
settle, compromise, prejudice or otherwise dispose of such Pre-Closing Period
Contest without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Buyer shall keep the Seller reasonably apprised of
developments in the contest and shall provide the Seller the opportunity to
attend meetings and to review and comment on submissions to be provided in
connection with the contest in advance of their submission, provided that all
decisions regarding the Pre-Closing Period contest shall be made in the good
faith discretion of the Buyer.

 



 

11.6 _Tax Refunds_. Upon receipt, Buyer shall promptly forward to Seller any
refund, rebate, abatement, reduction or other recovery (whether direct or
indirect through a right of set-off or credit) of Taxes of or with respect to
each Acquired Entity or its Assets, and any interest received thereon, with
respect to any Pre-Closing Period, including the pre-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period.

 



 

11.7 _Consistency_. Seller and Purchaser intend that, for United States
federal income tax purposes, the sale of the Membership Interests to Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a sale by Seller of the
Membership Interests of the Project Company and as a purchase by Purchaser of
the assets of the Project Company pursuant to Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 CB
432, (1/15/1999). Unless otherwise required by any Governmental Rule, Seller
and Purchaser shall prepare and file, and cause its respective Affiliates to
prepare and file, its Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such treatment.

 



 

11.8 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) _Purchase Price Allocation Schedule_. As promptly as practicable, but in
no event later than ninety (90) days following the date of this Agreement,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a written statement setting forth a
proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (plus any additional amounts
required to be taken into account under the Code) among the assets of the
Company (the " _Proposed Purchase Price Allocation Schedule_ "). Buyer shall
be responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the preparation of
the Proposed Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, including without limitation
all expenses related to the use of third parties to assist in the preparation
of the Proposed Purchase Price Allocation Schedule.

 



 

(b) _Dispute Notice_. Seller shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of
the Proposed Purchase Price Allocation Schedule to review the Proposed
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and to notify Buyer in writing if Seller
disputes the allocation set forth in the Proposed

 



      
 

 



 

Purchase Price Allocation Schedule. In connection with Sellers review,
Seller shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents prepared by Buyer or its representatives in connection with its
preparation of the Proposed Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and to finance
personnel of Buyer and the Company and any other information which Seller
reasonably requests, and Buyer and the Company shall cooperate reasonably with
Seller in connection therewith. In the event that Seller shall deliver an
Allocation Dispute Notice to Buyer, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good
faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as practicable and, upon such
resolution, if any, any adjustments to the Proposed Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule shall be made in accordance with the agreement of Buyer and Seller
(the " _Agreed Allocation Schedule_ ").

 



 

(c) _Reporting_. The Seller and the Buyer (a) shall report the federal, state
and local income and other Tax consequences of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and in particular shall report the information required by Section
1060(b) of the Code on the Form 8594, in a manner consistent with the Agreed
Allocation Schedule or the Final Allocation Schedule (as applicable, the "
_Allocation Schedule_ " and as modified pursuant to Section 11.8(d) below, as
applicable) and shall contemporaneously provide the other Party hereto with a
copy of the Form 8594 being filed; and (b) shall not take any position
inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax return and any refund
claim, and any litigation, investigation or otherwise, unless required by
applicable Laws or with the consent of the other Party.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments to Allocation Schedule_. The allocation set forth on the
Allocation Schedule shall be modified to reflect any adjustments to the
Purchase Price made pursuant to this Agreement as mutually agreed upon by
Buyer and Seller in good faith (and, if applicable, consistent with the prior
allocation of similar items). If the parties have filed Forms 8594 prior to
determining adjustments to the Purchase Price, the parties shall file an
amendment to Form 8594 to reflect any adjustments made to the Allocation
Schedule as provided in this Section 11.8.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

12.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
each Party to this Agreement will bear its respective expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions, including all fees and expenses related to
such Partys agents, representatives, legal counsel, and accountants. At the
Closing, Seller will cause each Company and each Subsidiary to have no
liability for out-of-pocket expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions except as reflected in the Closing Financial
Statements. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the obligation of
each Party to pay its own expenses will be subject to any rights of such Party
arising from a breach of this Agreement by another Party.

 



 

12.2 _Public Announcements_. Any public announcement or similar publicity with
respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions will be issued, if
at all, only with the mutual consent of Buyer and Seller; provided that each
Party is expressly permitted to make such announcements or other disclosures
as are required by applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a Party is required by applicable Legal

 



      
 

 



 

Requirements to make a public announcement or similar publicity with respect
to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, such Party shall not
identify the other Parties party to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions.

 



 

12.3 _Confidentiality_. If the Contemplated Transactions are not consummated,
each Party will return or destroy as much of such written Confidential
Information as the other Party may reasonably request.

 



 

12.4 _Notices_. All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under
this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given
when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b) sent by
facsimile (with written confirmation of receipt), or (c) received by the
addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service
(receipt requested), in each case to the appropriate addresses and facsimile
numbers set forth in Schedule 12.4 attached hereto (or to such other addresses
and facsimile numbers as a Party may designate by notice to the other
Parties); provided, that if a Party refuses to accept delivery, such notice,
consent, waiver or other communication shall be deemed to have been given on
the date of such refusal of delivery.

 



 

12.5 _Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) Any action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any rights arising out of, this Agreement shall be brought solely and
exclusively against any of the Parties in the courts of the State of New York
and each of the Parties consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding and waives
any objection to venue laid therein. Process in any action or proceeding
referred to in the preceding sentence may be served on any Party anywhere in
the world.

 



 

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



 

12.6 _Further Assurances_. The Parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to
each other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other
such other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as any
other Party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent
of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.

 



 

12.7 _Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the Parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party
in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
(a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one Party,
in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless
in writing signed by the other Party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a
Party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is
given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one Party will be deemed to be a
waiver of any obligation of such Party or of the right of the Party giving
such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as
provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

 



 

12.8 _Entire Agreement and Modification_. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements between the Parties with respect to its subject matter (including
the Commitment Letter and accompanying Summary of Terms between ATN and Seller
dated December 1, 2014) and constitutes (along with the documents referred to
in this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the
agreement between the Parties with respect to its subject matter. This
Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by each
Party.

 



 

12.9 _Assignments, Successors, and No Third-Party Rights_. No Party may assign
any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior consent of the other
Parties except that Buyer may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to
any Related Person of Buyer. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of
the successors, heirs, legal representatives, and permitted assigns of the
Parties. If Buyer assigns its rights hereunder to any Related Person of Buyer,
then Buyer shall remain primarily liable to the other Parties for the
obligations of Buyer hereunder. Except as set forth in Section 5.14, nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person other than the Parties to this Agreement, the indemnified Persons any
legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and all of its
provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement and their successors, heirs, legal representatives
and permitted assigns, and the indemnified Persons.

 



 

12.10 _Offset Rights_. Any Party shall have the right to offset any obligation
owing to it against any obligation otherwise owing to another Party.

 



 

12.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

 



 

12.12 _Section Headings, Construction_. The headings of Articles or Sections
in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its
construction or interpretation. All references to "Article", "Articles",
"Section" or "Sections" refer to the corresponding Article, Articles, Section
or Sections of this Agreement. All words used in this Agreement will be
construed to be of such gender or number as the circumstances require. Unless
otherwise expressly provided, the word "including" does not limit the
preceding words or terms.

 



      
 

 



 

12.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the
State of New York without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

 



 

12.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement. This Agreement may be executed and delivered via
facsimile transmission, e-mail, or other similar electronic means.

 



 

12.15 _Major Maintenance_. From the Closing Date until the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Parties agree that Buyer may deliver to
the Escrow Agent such notices as may be required under the Escrow Agreement to
cause the release of funds from the Major Maintenance Escrow Amount to Buyer
or any Acquired Entity for use in making capital expenditures or procuring
services that, in either case, in the reasonable, good faith judgment of
Buyer, are (a) necessary for the continued operation (in the Ordinary Course
of Business) of the Solar Power Projects owned by the Acquired Entities and
(b) not subject to performance or payment obligations of Borrego Solar
Systems, LLC under the terms and conditions of the Operations and Maintenance
Agreement with Borrego Solar Systems, LLC. Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Entities to, diligently pursue all rights under warranties, insurance
policies, indemnification agreements or otherwise, to obtain reimbursement or
other recovery of amounts released to Buyer or any Acquired Entity pursuant to
this Section 12.15, and upon receipt of any such reimbursement or recovery,
shall remit the proceeds thereof to Seller. Without limiting the foregoing,
Seller shall be subrogated to the rights of Buyer or any Acquired Entity under
insurance policies with respect to recovery of such amounts. On the twelve
(12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Parties agree to deliver to
the Escrow Agent such joint notices as may be required to cause the release to
Seller of all amounts remaining in the Major Maintenance Escrow Amount.
