or more of its Purchaser Designated Subsidiaries to purchase) and, at the
Closing, accept from Sellers, the Acquired Companies Equity Interests, free
and clear of all Liens.

 

Article III 
CONSIDERATION

 

Section 3.1Consideration

 

. The aggregate consideration (the "Purchase Price") for the Acquired
Companies Equity Interests shall be an amount in cash equal to (a)
$185,000,000 (the "Base Purchase Price"), plus (b) the Closing Company Cash,
as finally determined in accordance with Section 3.4(c) or Section 3.4(d),
minus (c) the Closing Company Indebtedness, as finally determined in
accordance with Section 3.4(c) or Section 3.4(d), plus (d) the amount (if any)
by which the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance
with Section 3.4(c) or Section 3.4(d) exceeds the Reference Working Capital,
minus (e) the amount (if any) by which the Reference Working Capital exceeds
the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with
Section 3.4(c) or Section 3.4(d), minus (f) the amount (if any) of Profit
Compensation to which Buckeye Germany is entitled with respect to the DPLTA
Stub Period or otherwise, as determined and subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section 7.15, plus (g) the amount (if any) of Loss
Compensation to which the German Company is entitled with respect to the DPLTA
Stub Period or otherwise, as determined and subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section 7.15, subject to further adjustment as provided in
Section 9.6.

  Section 3.2Payment of Purchase Price

 

.

 

(a)At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay (or cause one or more Purchaser
Designated Subsidiaries to pay) to Sellers an amount (the "Initial Purchase
Price") equal to (i) the Base Purchase Price, plus (ii) the Initial Closing
Company Cash, minus (iii) the Initial Closing Company Indebtedness, plus (iv)
the amount (if any) by which the Initial Closing Net Working Capital exceeds
the Reference Working Capital, minus (v) the amount (if any) by which the
Reference Working Capital exceeds the Initial Closing Net Working Capital,
minus (vi) the Estimated Profit Transfer Amount (if any), plus (vii) the
Estimated Loss Transfer Amount (if any). The Initial Purchase Price shall be
paid to Sellers, by wire transfers of immediately available funds into the
Purchase Price Bank Accounts, in accordance with the respective percentages
set forth on Schedule 3.2(a). For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of the
Initial Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 3.2(a) shall not govern, and
Section 7.16(j) shall govern, the allocation of the Purchase Price and, in the
event of any difference between the Allocation as determined by Section
7.16(j) and this Section 3.2(a), Sellers shall make any necessary adjustments
between themselves.

 

(b)Subject to Section 10.7, but otherwise notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser (or its Purchaser Designated
Subsidiaries, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amount otherwise payable to Sellers under this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law, and, if any amount is so
deducted and withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Tax Authority,
such deducted, withheld and remitted amount shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to Sellers; provided, however, that
before making any such deduction and withholding, Purchaser (or its Purchaser
Designated Subsidiaries, if applicable) shall give Sellers reasonable advance
notice of any anticipated deduction and withholding (together with reasonable
detail as to the legal basis for, and a calculation of, such anticipated
withholding) and provide Sellers with sufficient opportunity to provide any
forms or other documentation or take such other steps in order to avoid such
deduction and withholding, and Purchaser (or its Purchaser Designated
Subsidiaries, if applicable) and Sellers will reasonably cooperate in good
faith to attempt to reduce any amounts that would otherwise be deducted and
withheld pursuant to this Section 3.2(b).

 

Section 3.3Closing Statement

 

. On a day at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing (the
"Closing Statement Delivery Date"), Sellers shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to Purchaser a written statement (the "Closing Statement") setting
forth Sellers' good faith estimates of (a) the Closing Net Working Capital
(the "Initial Closing Net Working Capital"), (b) the Closing Company Cash (the
"Initial Closing Company Cash"), (c) the Closing Company Indebtedness (the
"Initial Closing Company Indebtedness"), and (d) the Estimated Profit Transfer
Amount (if any) or the Estimated Loss Transfer Amount (if any), as
contemplated by Section 7.15(b)(i), in each case, in Euros and converted into
U.S. dollars in accordance with the currency exchange methodology set forth in
the Agreed Principles, and (e) the Initial Purchase Price, in U.S. dollars,
together with reasonable supporting documentation for the determination of the
foregoing amounts. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall consider in good
faith Purchaser's reasonable comments on the Closing Statement, and Sellers
may make any corresponding changes to the Closing Statement that the Parties
agree based on Purchaser's comments. The Closing Statement shall also
designate a bank account for each Seller (together,

  the "Purchase Price Bank Accounts") to which the Initial Purchase Price shall
be paid at the Closing as contemplated by Section 3.2(a) and set forth the
related wire transfer instructions. "Closing Net Working Capital" means the
current assets of the Acquired Companies (including for such purposes only the
line items set forth on Schedule 3.3) reduced by the current liabilities of
the Acquired Companies (including for such purposes only the line items set
forth on Schedule 3.3), in each case, as of the Effective Time (disregarding
any transactions involving the Acquired Companies effected by Purchaser on the
Closing Date at or after the Closing and prior to the Effective Time) and as
otherwise determined in accordance with the accounting principles set forth on
Schedule 3.3 (the "Agreed Principles"). Sellers shall use the latest
available information as of the Closing Statement Delivery Date to estimate
the Initial Closing Net Working Capital, Initial Closing Company Cash and
Initial Closing Company Indebtedness.

 

Section 3.4True-up of Net Working Capital, Cash and Indebtedness

 

.

 

(a)As promptly as practicable, but no later than 90 days, after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Sellers a
statement (the "Final Closing Statement") setting forth Purchaser's
calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Company Cash and
Closing Company Indebtedness, in each case, in Euros and converted into U.S.
dollars in accordance with the currency exchange methodology set forth in the
Agreed Principles, together with reasonable supporting documentation for such
calculations.

 

(b)During the 30-day period following Sellers' receipt of the Final Closing
Statement, Sellers and their accountants and other Representatives shall be
permitted reasonable access to review the books and records and other
information of the Acquired Companies relevant to the preparation of the Final
Closing Statement during regular business hours and such other good faith,
reasonable cooperation from Purchaser and its personnel, accountants and other
Representatives (including access to the personnel, accountants and other
Representatives of Purchaser and the Acquired Companies involved in the
preparation of the Final Closing Statement) as they may reasonably request to
enable them to review and evaluate Purchaser's determination of the Final
Closing Statement; provided that such review and evaluation shall only be upon
reasonable notice, and in compliance with all applicable Laws, shall not
unreasonably disrupt personnel and operations of the Business and shall be at
Sellers' sole cost and expense.

 

(c)If Sellers disagree with Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital, the Closing Company Cash or the Closing Company Indebtedness as set
forth in the Final Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(a),
Sellers may, within 30 days after receipt of the Final Closing Statement,
deliver a written notice to Purchaser disagreeing with Purchaser's
calculations and setting forth Sellers' calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital, the Closing Company Cash or the Closing Company Indebtedness, as
applicable. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify in reasonable
detail those items or amounts as to which Sellers disagree, and Sellers shall
be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Final Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(a) and all such
disputed items shall be based only on (i) mathematical or clerical errors or
(ii) the amounts included in the Final Closing Statement having not been
determined in accordance with the Agreed Principles. If no notice of
disagreement is received by Purchaser within the such 30 day

  period, then the Final Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted
by Sellers and will become final and binding upon the Parties.

 

(d)If a notice of disagreement shall have been duly and timely delivered
pursuant to Section 3.4(c), Sellers and Purchaser shall, during the 15 days
after such delivery, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may
be required, the amount of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Company Cash
or Closing Company Indebtedness. If Sellers and Purchaser reach agreement
with respect to any of the disputed items or amounts during such period (or at
any time thereafter), then such agreed items or amounts shall be agreed in
writing by Sellers and Purchaser, and such written agreement shall be final
and binding with respect to such items or amounts. If during such period,
Sellers and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement as to all of the
disputed items or amounts, they shall promptly thereafter cause the Accounting
Referee to review this Agreement and the remaining disputed items or amounts
for the purpose of calculating Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Company
Cash or Closing Company Indebtedness (it being understood that in making such
calculation, the Accounting Referee shall be functioning as an expert and not
as an arbitrator). In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall
consider only those items or amounts in the Final Closing Statement and
Purchaser's calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Company Cash
or Closing Company Indebtedness as to which Sellers have disagreed and Sellers
and Purchaser have not reached written agreement. Sellers and Purchaser shall
instruct the Accounting Referee to deliver to Sellers and Purchaser, as
promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than 30 days from the date
of engagement of the Accounting Referee), a report setting forth such
calculation; provided, however, that in no event shall any of the disputed
items or amounts determined by the Accounting Referee be (i) less than
Purchaser's calculation thereof in the Final Closing Statement where a lower
amount would benefit Purchaser, (ii) more than Sellers' calculation thereof in
their notice of disagreement delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(c) where a
higher amount would benefit Sellers, (iii) more than Purchaser's calculation
thereof in the Final Closing Statement where a higher amount would benefit
Purchaser, or (iv) less than Sellers' calculation thereof in their notice of
disagreement delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(c) where a lower amount would
benefit Sellers. Such report shall be final and binding upon Sellers and
Purchaser. The Parties shall provide the Accounting Referee with all
necessary documents as requested by it as soon as possible. The Accounting
Referee shall be instructed to grant the Parties the opportunity to state
their points of view and, upon request by a Party, the Accounting Referee
shall conduct a hearing on any disputed items or amounts as to which Sellers
and Purchaser have not reached written agreement. All submissions by Sellers
or Purchaser to the Accounting Referee shall be in writing and shall
simultaneously be delivered to the other, and there shall be no ex parte
communication with the Accounting Referee. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Referee shall be borne in the same proportion as the aggregate
dollar amount of the unresolved matters that are submitted to the Accounting
Referee pursuant to this Section 3.4(d) that are unsuccessfully disputed by
each Party (as finally determined by the Accounting Referee) bears to the
aggregate dollar amount of all of the unresolved matters that are submitted to
the Accounting Referee.

 

(e)Sellers and Purchaser shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause their respective Representatives to, cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Final Closing Statement and any notice of disagreement
contemplated by Section 3.4(c) and in the

  conduct of the review and dispute resolution process provided for in this
Section 3.4, including by making available books, records, work papers and
personnel to the extent necessary.

 

(f)If, based on the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Company Cash and
Closing Company Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to Section 3.4(c)
or Section 3.4(d), (i) the amount equal to (A) the Base Purchase Price, plus
(B) the Closing Company Cash, minus (C) the Closing Company Indebtedness, plus
(D) the amount (if any) by which the Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the
Reference Working Capital, minus (E) the amount (if any) by which the
Reference Working Capital exceeds Closing Net Working Capital, minus (F) the
Estimated Profit Transfer Amount (if any) set forth in the Closing Statement
as contemplated by Section 7.15(b)(i), plus (G) the Estimated Loss Transfer
Amount (if any) set forth in the Closing Statement as contemplated by Section
7.15(b)(i) exceeds (ii) the amount of the Initial Purchase Price, Purchaser
shall pay to Sellers such excess amount as provided in Section 3.4(g). If,
based on the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Company Cash and Closing
Company Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to Section 3.4(c) or
Section 3.4(d), (i) the amount of the Initial Purchase Price exceeds (ii) the
amount equal to (A) the Base Purchase Price, plus (B) the Closing Company
Cash, minus (C) the Closing Company Indebtedness, plus (D) the amount (if any)
by which the Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the Reference Working
Capital, minus (E) the amount (if any) by which the Reference Working Capital
exceeds Closing Net Working Capital, minus (F) the Estimated Profit Transfer
Amount (if any) set forth in the Closing Statement as contemplated by Section
7.15(b)(i), plus (G) the Estimated Loss Transfer Amount (if any) set forth in
the Closing Statement as contemplated by Section 7.15(b)(i), Sellers shall pay
to Purchaser such excess amount as provided in Section 3.4(g).

 

(g)Any payment pursuant to Section 3.4(f) shall be made within five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Company Cash and
Closing Company Indebtedness have been finally determined pursuant to Section
3.4(c) or Section 3.4(d), by wire transfer by Purchaser, on the one hand, or
Sellers, on the other hand, as the case may be, of immediately available funds
to such account or accounts as may be designated in writing by the other for
such purpose.

any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in

.

 

(a)In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section
4.3, except as provided in Section 4.4(b), this Agreement shall thereafter be
void and of no further force or effect and such termination shall be without
Liability to Purchaser or any Seller, except that the provisions of Article I,
this Section 4.4 and Article X shall survive any termination of this
Agreement; provided that no termination shall relieve any Party from Liability
for any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement prior
to such termination other than in the case of a breach by Purchaser of any
covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in Section 7.4 or Section 7.5 (in
the case of Section 7.5, to the extent related to Purchaser's efforts with
respect to obtaining any approval required under the German Competition Law or
any other Applicable Competition Law), which shall, except with respect to any
Unexcused Regulatory Efforts Breach, be subject to the provisions of Section
4.4(b).

 

(b)In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Sellers or Purchaser
in accordance with its terms pursuant to Section 4.3(c) based upon an Order
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby in connection with any approval required
under the German Competition Law or any other Applicable Competition Law, (ii)
this Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to Section 4.3(d) based upon
a breach by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in
Section 7.4, or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Sellers or Purchaser
pursuant to Section 4.3(a) and, at the time of such termination as
contemplated by this clause (iii), all conditions to the Closing set forth in
Section 8.1 have been satisfied or waived other than (A) conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, and but for such termination,
would be satisfied at the Closing and (B) conditions set forth in Section
8.1(c) (so long as such Section 8.1(c) remains unsatisfied solely due to an
Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby in connection with any approval required
under the German Competition Law or any other Applicable Competition Law) or
Section 8.1(d), then Purchaser will pay, or cause to be paid, to Sellers an
amount equal to $8,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"). The payment of the
Termination Fee shall be made

  within five (5) Business Days after such termination by wire transfer by
Purchaser of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be
designated in writing by Sellers for such purpose. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, if this Agreement is terminated in
circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable, then Sellers' receipt of
the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Sellers and their Affiliates against Purchaser and any of
its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives for any Losses
suffered as a result of any breach by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement
of Purchaser contained in Section 7.4 or Section 7.5 (in the case of Section
7.5, relating to Purchaser's efforts with respect to obtaining any approval
required under the German Competition Law or any other Applicable Competition
Law) that is not an Unexcused Regulatory Efforts Breach and, upon payment of
the Termination Fee, none of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective Representatives shall have any further Liability relating to
or arising out of any such breach. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Section 4.4(b) shall affect Sellers' rights to specifically enforce the
terms of Section 7.4 as contemplated by Section 10.8 prior to termination of
this Agreement.

real property and each other jurisdiction in which its conduct of business or

binding obligation of such Seller, enforceable against such Seller in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,

applicable requirements of the German Act against Restraints of

this Agreement is subject (collectively, with the German Competition Law, the
"Applicable Competition Laws") and (ii) such Orders, Permits, declarations,
filings and notifications as to which the failure to obtain, make or give the
same would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially interfere with

standalone Contract, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Contract
related to (I) items identified on Schedule 5.18(b) as not being available for

conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over the
Business.

  Section 7.3Consents

 

.

 

(a)During the Pre-Closing Period, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Acquired

conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), that may be required by any provision of any Real Property Lease,
Personal Property Lease, Material Contract or Permit of an Acquired Company in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, in each case, that neither Sellers nor any of
their Affiliates shall be required to (i) amend or modify any Real Property
Lease, Personal Property Lease or Material Contract (other than, at the
request of the other party to any such Contract in connection with its
delivery of such consent, to agree to a novation of the Contract to Purchaser
effective as of the Closing), (ii) relinquish or forbear any material rights,
(iii) pay any consideration to any Person, or (iv) otherwise incur any
Liabilities or provide any financial accommodation or become secondarily or
contingently liable for any Liability, for the purpose of obtaining any such
consent; provided further that in connection therewith, Sellers shall not, and

of Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (A)
amend any Real Property Lease, Personal Property Lease or Material Contract of
an Acquired Company, (B) commit to make any payments other than cash payments

endeavoring to obtain the consent of any Person required by any provision of

the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that such efforts shall not require Sellers to incur any Liabilities
or provide any financial accommodation or to be secondarily or contingently
liable for any Liability.

 

Section 7.4Regulatory Approvals

 

.

 

(a)Each of the Parties shall (i) make or cause to be made all filings required
of each of them or any of their respective Affiliates under the German
Competition Law or any other Applicable Competition Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date of this Agreement, or as otherwise agreed among the Parties, (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to comply at the earliest reasonably practicable date
with any request under the German Competition Law or any other Applicable
Competition Law for additional information, documents or other materials
received by each of them or any of their respective Affiliates from any
Governmental Body in respect of such filings or such transactions, and (iii)
cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing (including, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, by responding to any reasonable
requests of any other Party for copies of documents or other materials prior
to filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested by any other Party in connection therewith) and in connection with
resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Body under
the German Competition Law or any other Applicable Competition Law with
respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each of the Parties shall
use its reasonable best efforts to furnish

  to each other all information required for any application or other filing to
be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that such materials may be
redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Business;
and (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or applicable
Law. Any Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, may, as it
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any information and
documents provided to the other Party under this Section 7.4 in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality and Joint Defense Agreement between
Purchaser and Seller Parent (the "Joint Defense Agreement"), the terms of
which shall be binding on Sellers as if each reference to Seller Parent
therein was a reference to Sellers, so as to limit access to such materials to
a subset of specified individuals. Either Seller, on the one hand, or
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall promptly inform the other Party of any
material oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications
with, any Governmental Body regarding any such filings or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Seller, on the one hand, nor
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall independently participate in any formal or
otherwise substantive meeting, whether in person or via telephone, with any
Governmental Body in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry
contemplated by this Section 7.4(a) without giving the other Party prior
notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body,
the opportunity to attend and/or participate in such meeting. Subject to
applicable Law, each Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, will consult and cooperate with the other Party in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals to be made or submitted by or on behalf of either Party relating
to proceedings under the German Competition Law or any other Applicable
Competition Law. Purchaser shall be entitled to direct, in consultation with
Sellers, the defense of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
antitrust investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any
Governmental Body or other Person relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including regulatory filings under the German Competition Law
or any other Applicable Competition Law. For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Purchaser, after prior consultation with Sellers, shall have the principal
responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any
necessary antitrust or competition review clearances and shall take the lead
in all meetings and communications with any Governmental Body in connection
with obtaining any such clearances. Purchaser and Sellers shall each bear 50%
of all filing fees in connection with all filings under the German Competition
Law and any other Applicable Competition Laws.

 

(b)Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Body with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the German
Competition Law or any other Applicable Competition Law.

 

(c)In no event shall Purchaser or Sellers be required to commit or agree to:
(i) the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets, businesses, services,
products or product lines of Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries or Purchaser
Parent or its Subsidiaries, (ii) the creation or termination of relationships,
ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Seller Parent or its
Subsidiaries or Purchaser Parent or its Subsidiaries or (iii) any other
actions that after the Closing would limit the freedom of Purchaser Parent's
or any of its Subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to, or ability to
retain their assets, businesses, services, products or product lines in order

  to obtain required approvals, consents, or clearances under antitrust Laws, or
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order in any
Action, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements.

 

(d)Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit Purchaser Parent or any of its
controlled Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire (including by merger,
consolidation or similar transaction) any assets, business, securities, Person
or subdivision engaged in the spunlaced or airlaid nonwoven business if such
acquisition or agreement to acquire would, or would reasonably be expected to,
prevent, delay beyond the Outside Date or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining the required approval or clearance under the German Competition Law
or any other Applicable Competition Law required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 7.5Efforts and Cooperation; Further Assurances

 

.

 

(a)From the date hereof until the Closing, each Party shall (i) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (A) take all actions necessary or
appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) each Party shall reasonably cooperate
with the other Parties in connection with such efforts of the other Parties.

 

(b)From the date hereof until the Closing, Sellers will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each employee of an Acquired Company and each
developer or creator of material Intellectual Property that is the subject
matter of the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement and the Buckeye
Germany MSA to execute a written agreement assigning all of their right, title
and interest in and to such Intellectual Property developed for or on behalf
of an Acquired Company to the applicable Acquired Company, Buckeye Germany, or
an Affiliate of Buckeye Germany, as applicable and as appropriate, to the
extent that such individual has not already executed such an agreement. 

 

(c)After the Closing, each Party will execute and deliver such documents and
take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by any other Party in
order to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d)If at any time after the Closing, either of Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates receives a payment intended for an Acquired Company, or
otherwise possesses any asset of an Acquired Company, Sellers shall promptly
deliver, or cause to be delivered, such payment or asset to the applicable
Acquired Company. If at any time after the Closing, any Acquired Company or
any of its Affiliates receives a payment intended for either of Sellers or any
of their respective Affiliates, or otherwise possesses any asset of either of
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, Purchaser shall promptly
deliver, or cause to be delivered, such payment or asset to Sellers.

Agreement to be terminated effective upon, and only upon, the Closing.

 

(b)For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, each Seller shall
hold and shall cause its Affiliates to hold, and shall use commercially

Acquired Companies or the Business (other than to the extent such information
is related to the Sellers and their respective Affiliates and their respective
businesses), (i) except to the extent that such information (A) is generally
available to or known by the public through no fault of it, its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives or (B) is lawfully acquired by it, its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the Closing from
sources which are not known by Sellers to be prohibited from disclosing such
information by nondisclosure obligations or duties, or (ii) unless and to the
extent it determines that disclosure of such information is required by
applicable Law or in the event the recipient thereof is subject to appropriate
nondisclosure obligations or duties. If a Seller determines that disclosure
of such information is required by applicable Law, such Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with applicable Law to consult with
Purchaser with respect thereto and to obtain appropriate confidential
treatment, if available, of such information as Purchaser may reasonably
request.

 

(c)For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
hold and shall cause its Affiliates to hold, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to hold,
in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, related to
each Seller and its Affiliates and their respective businesses (other than to

Business), (i) except to the extent that such information (A) is generally
available to or known by the public through no fault of Purchaser, its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives or (B) is lawfully acquired by
Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after
the Closing from sources which are not known by Purchaser to be prohibited
from disclosing such information by nondisclosure obligations or duties, or
(ii) unless and to the extent Purchaser determines that disclosure of such
information is required by applicable Law or in the event the recipient
thereof is subject to appropriate nondisclosure obligations or duties. If
Purchaser determines that disclosure of such information is required by
applicable Law, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
consistent with applicable Law to consult with Sellers with respect thereto
and to obtain appropriate confidential treatment, if available, of such
information as Sellers may reasonably request.

 

Section 7.7Indemnification and Exculpation

 

.

 

(a)From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired
Companies to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the individuals who on or in the five years
prior to the Closing Date were

  directors or officers of the Acquired Companies (collectively, the
"Indemnitees") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such or taken at the request of an Acquired Company at any time
prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser further agrees that all rights of the
Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, as provided for in, or
implied by, the Organizational Documents of the Acquired Companies as now in
effect (if applicable), any employment or service agreements of the
Indemnitees, and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of the
Acquired Companies, in each case, in effect as of the date hereof, shall
survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.
Such rights shall not be amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitees, unless such modification
is required by Law.

 

(b)The provisions of this Section 7.7: (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her legal representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in

such Indemnitee may have by Contract or otherwise.

consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Purchaser shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this Section 7.7.

 

(d)The obligations of Purchaser under this Section 7.7 shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom
this Section 7.7 applies without the consent of the affected Indemnitee (it
being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 7.7 applies
are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.7).

 

Section 7.8Preservation of Records

(a)After the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to
preserve and keep the records relating to the Acquired Companies for a period
of seven (7) years from the Closing Date, or, if shorter, in accordance with
the standard record retention policies of Purchaser, or, if longer, as
required by applicable Law. Purchaser, upon any reasonable request from
Sellers or their Representatives, shall cause the Acquired Companies to make
available to each Seller and its Representatives such records, and personnel
of the Acquired Companies familiar therewith, as may be reasonably requested
by any Seller in connection with claims by or against such Seller or any of
its Affiliates related to the Acquired Companies or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or compliance by such Seller with its
obligations under this Agreement or any Seller Document; provided that
Purchaser shall not be obligated to make available (i) information that, if
provided to Sellers or their Representatives, would violate applicable Law or
(ii) any information, the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to
result in the loss of any legal privilege available to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) relating to such information or
would cause Purchaser or any of its

  Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) to breach a confidentiality
obligation by which it is bound; provided further that Purchaser shall notify
Sellers of the nature of the information being withheld and, at Sellers'
request, take reasonable actions or implement arrangements (which could
include, depending on the reasonableness thereof in the circumstances,
entering into confidentiality agreements or joint defense agreements,
obtaining the consent of third parties, redacting parts of documents,
preparing "clean" summaries of information or limiting the availability of
information to a "clean team" or to outside legal counsel) in order to make
information available to Sellers or its Representatives to the extent
reasonably possible. In the event that Purchaser wishes to destroy such
records prior to such time, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies first
to give 90 days prior written notice to Sellers, and Sellers shall have the
right at their option and expense, upon prior written notice given to
Purchaser within that 90 day period, to take possession of the records within
180 days after the date of such notice.

 

(b)After the Closing Date, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates, to
preserve and keep the records relating to the Acquired Companies for a period
of seven (7) years from the Closing Date, or, if shorter, in accordance with
the standard record retention policies of Sellers, or, if longer, as required
by applicable Law. Sellers, upon any reasonable request from Purchaser or its
Representatives, shall, and shall cause their Affiliates, to make available to
Purchaser and its Representatives such records, as may be reasonably requested
by Purchaser in connection with claims by or against Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates related to the Acquired Companies or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or compliance by Purchaser with its obligations under this
Agreement or any Purchaser Document; provided that Sellers shall not be
obligated to make available (i) information that, if provided to Purchaser or
its Representatives, would violate applicable Law or (ii) any information, the
disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of any
legal privilege available to Sellers or any of their Affiliates relating to
such information or would cause Sellers or any of their Affiliates to breach a
confidentiality obligation by which any of them is bound; provided further
that Sellers shall notify Purchaser of the nature of the information being
withheld and, at Purchaser's request, take reasonable actions or implement
arrangements (which could include, depending on the reasonableness thereof in
the circumstances, entering into confidentiality agreements or joint defense
agreements, obtaining the consent of third parties, redacting parts of
documents, preparing "clean" summaries of information or limiting the
availability of information to a "clean team" or to outside legal counsel) in
order to make information available to Purchaser or its Representatives to the
extent reasonably possible. In the event that Sellers wish to destroy such
records prior to such time, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, first give 90 days prior written notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
have the right at its option and expense, upon prior written notice given to
Sellers within that 90 day period, to take possession of the records within
180 days after the date of such notice.

 

Section 7.9Publicity

following the execution of this Agreement, which press releases shall be
mutually agreed. Thereafter, no Party shall, and each Party shall cause its
Affiliates not to, issue any press release or public announcement concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the
prior written approval of the other Parties (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless such Party determines,
after consulting with counsel, that disclosure is required by applicable Law.
If a Party so determines that disclosure of such information is required by
applicable Law, such Party

  shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with applicable Law
to consult with the other Parties with respect thereto.

 

Section 7.10Use of Name

 

. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except as set forth in this Section
7.10, from and after the Closing Date (a) the Acquired Companies shall have no
right, title or interest in or to the name "Georgia-Pacific", "GP", "MBM
Materials", "Market Based Management", "MBM", "Buckeye" or any service marks,
trademarks, trade names, domain names, identifying symbols, logos, emblems,
signs or insignia related thereto or containing or comprising the foregoing,
including any derivations, modifications or alterations thereof, or any word,
name or mark confusingly similar thereto (collectively, the "GP Marks"), and
(b) the Acquired Companies shall have no right to use the GP Marks.
Immediately after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause each of the Acquired
Companies to cease to hold itself out as having any affiliation with any
Seller or Affiliate thereof. In furtherance thereof, Purchaser shall cause
each of the Acquired Companies to (i) pass appropriate resolutions to
eliminate any GP Marks from its corporate name within five (5) Business Days
following the Closing Date, and have such name change filed with and
registered in the applicable commercial register as promptly as practicable
but in no event later than 45 days after the Closing Date and thereupon
promptly deliver to Sellers a copy of such filing and registration, and (ii)
as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 180 days after the
Closing Date, remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all GP Marks from
all properties and assets of such Acquired Company, including all vehicles,
business cards, schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs,
promotional materials, manuals, forms, and computer software, technical
guidelines, standards and procedures and other materials. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Acquired Companies shall have the right to use the GP Marks in
connection with the foregoing uses during such 45 or 180 day period, as
applicable. The Acquired Companies shall not be required to remove any GP
Marks from (A) any of their inventories of finished goods and products or
goods and process whose manufacturing is in process as of the Closing Date,
(B) any physical copies of schematics, plans, manuals, drawings, datasheets,
and similar documentation in existence as of the Closing Date to the extent
that such copies are used only in the ordinary conduct of the internal
operations of the Business, or (C) any machinery or tooling, including hand
tools, of the Business in existence as of the Closing Date, to the extent that
such instrumentalities are used only in the ordinary conduct of the internal
operations of the Business. The Acquired Companies shall have the right to
sell their inventories of products existing as of the Closing Date and
products whose manufacturing is in process as of the Closing Date, in each
case using existing packaging, labeling, containers, supplies, advertising
materials, technical data sheets and any similar materials bearing the GP
Marks until the earlier of (I) 180 after the Closing Date or (II) the
depletion of such existing inventory and any products whose manufacturing is
in process as of the Closing Date. Sellers hereby grant to Purchaser and the
Acquired Companies a limited right and license to use the GP Marks as
specified in, and during the periods, if any, set forth in this Section
subject to Purchaser and the Acquired Companies using the GP Marks in
compliance with Sellers' reasonable usage guidelines as communicated by Seller
to Purchaser from time to time in writing.

 

Section 7.11Employment and Employee Benefits

 

.

 

(a)Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the employment relationships of all
Continuing Employees with the Acquired Companies pursuant to applicable Law
will remain

  in place with all rights and obligations accruing to them immediately prior to

contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b)For a period of one year after the Closing Date, or such longer period of
time required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one or more
of its Affiliates to, provide Continuing Employees, who will remain employed
with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, with compensation (including
salary, wages and opportunities for commissions, bonuses, incentive pay,
overtime and premium pay), employee benefits, location of employment and a
position of employment that are, in each case, substantially equivalent to
those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(c)If, within one year after the Closing Date, the employment of any
Continuing Employee is terminated by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser
for a reason other than cause, then Purchaser shall provide such Continuing
Employee such severance benefits as Purchaser and its Affiliates make
available to their similarly situated employees.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent
that (i) any applicable Law or (ii) any applicable Contract or other
arrangement with a labor union, trade association, works council or economic
committee, or any similar employee representative body or any individual
employee, would require Purchaser or its Affiliates (including any Acquired
Company) to provide any more favorable terms of employment (including
compensation and benefits) to any Continuing Employee than those otherwise
provided for by this Section 7.11 (or extend the period of time for which the
standards set forth in this Section 7.11 are required to be met), then
Purchaser agrees to comply, or to cause its Affiliates to comply, with its
obligations under each such applicable Law or Contract.

 

Section 7.12Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition

 

.

 

(a)For a period of 18 months after the Closing Date, each Seller shall not,
and shall cause Seller Parent and its controlled Affiliates (other than
Sellers) not to, directly or indirectly, hire or employ, or cause, solicit,
induce or encourage any Continuing Employees to leave their employment with
Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not prohibit (i) general solicitations of employment not specifically
directed toward Continuing Employees or the hiring of such employees in
response thereto, (ii) the solicitation, hiring, employment or engagement of
any Continuing Employee (other than a Continuing Employee who is identified on
Schedule 7.12(a)(iii)) who has not been employed by Purchaser or any Affiliate
thereof for a period of three months, or (iii) the solicitation, hiring,
employment or engagement of any Continuing Employee identified on Schedule
7.12(a)(iii) at any time following the termination of such Continuing Employee
by Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof.

 

(b)For a period of three years after the Closing Date, each Seller shall not,
and shall cause Seller Parent and its controlled Affiliates (other than
Sellers) not to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate or control any
enterprise, regardless of form, engaged in developing, manufacturing,
marketing, selling or distributing, within Europe, substrate roll goods using
standard airlaid web forming processes, including spooled and festooned
products, that are manufactured by the Business as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Seller Restricted

  Business"); provided that the foregoing restrictions shall not: (i) apply to
any business acquired by any Seller, Seller Parent or any controlled Affiliate
of Seller Parent other than Sellers, so long as revenue from the sale of
products manufactured by any Seller Restricted Business comprising a portion
of the acquired business does not comprise more than 20% of such acquired
business' total revenue; provided further nothing herein shall prevent any
Seller, Seller Parent or any controlled Affiliate of Seller Parent other than
Sellers from acquiring a business in which more than 20% of such acquired
business' total revenue is comprised of revenue from the sale of products
manufactured by any Seller Restricted Business, so long as such Seller, Seller
Parent or controlled Affiliate of Seller Parent other than Sellers, as
applicable, within one year following the date of such acquisition, divests
the portion of such acquired business that constitutes a Seller Restricted
Business; or (ii) restrict any Seller, Seller Parent or any controlled
Affiliate of Seller Parent other than Sellers from acquiring or owning
securities of any Person engaged in a Seller Restricted Business, so long as
such securities do not constitute more than 10% of all equity securities of
such Person and, except for exercising minority voting rights with respect to
such securities, such Seller, Seller Parent or controlled Affiliate of Seller
Parent other than Sellers, as applicable, does not otherwise actively manage,
operate or control the business activities of such Person.

 

(c)Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the remedies at law available for
breach of its obligations under this Section 7.12 would be inadequate;
therefore, in addition to any other rights or remedies that Purchaser may have
at law or in equity, Purchaser shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief in any proceeding that may be brought to enforce any
provision contained in this Section 7.12, without the necessity of proof of
actual damage.

 

(d)Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the covenants of each Seller
contained in this Section 7.12 are being provided as an inducement to
Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and such covenants include reasonable
limitations with respect to time, geographical area and scope of activity that
do not impose a greater restraint on each Seller than is necessary to protect
the legitimate business interests of Purchaser.

 

(e)In the event that any covenant contained in this Section 7.12 is determined
by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever, then such covenant will not be deemed void, and the Parties agree
that (i) the limitations with respect to time, geographical area and scope of
activity included in such covenant, as applicable, may be modified by such
court to instead reflect the maximum limitations with respect thereto that are
enforceable and (ii) solely for purposes of the operation of such covenant in
the context of the controversy in which such determination is made, such
covenant will be deemed amended in accordance with such modification. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that (A) it
is their continuing desire for each covenant contained in this Section 7.12 to
be enforced to the full extent of its terms, but (B) if a court of competent
jurisdiction finds the limitations included in any such covenant
unenforceable, the court should redefine the limitations included in such
covenant so as to comply with applicable Law.

 

(f)If a Seller has violated Section 7.12(a) or Section 7.12(b), then the time
period set forth in such Section shall automatically be extended by a period
of time equal in length to the period during which such violation or
violations occurred.

  Section 7.13Company Guarantees

 

.

 

(a)Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the
respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Sellers, on or before the Closing, valid and binding written releases of
Sellers and their respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies),
as applicable, from any Liability, whether arising before, on or after the
Closing Date, under any Company Guarantees provided to any Person (other than
Sellers and their Affiliates) in effect as of the Closing to the extent such
Liability is related to obligations of any Acquired Company, including by
providing substitute guarantees with terms that are at least as favorable to
the counterparty as the terms of the applicable Company Guarantees and by
furnishing letters of credit, instituting escrow arrangements, posting surety
or performance bonds or making other arrangements as the counterparty may
reasonably request. If any such Company Guarantee has not been so released as
of the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall continue to use its commercially
reasonable efforts after the Closing to cause each such unreleased Company
Guarantee to be released as promptly as reasonably practicable. Sellers
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser and its Affiliates in order to obtain such releases or
substitutions.

 

(b)Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and any Affiliate
thereof from and after the Closing for any Losses based upon or arising from
any Company Guarantees provided to any Person (other than a Seller or one of
its Affiliates) to the extent such Losses are related to obligations of any
Acquired Company.

 

Section 7.14Affiliate Contracts; Intercompany Balances

 

. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.14 and in Section 7.15, Sellers shall
cause all Contracts (including any Tax Sharing Agreements) between and among
any Acquired Company, on the one hand, and Seller Parent or a Retained
Company, on the other hand, to be terminated and fully settled effective prior
to the Closing without any Liability to or by any Retained Company, by the
parties thereto, whereupon such Contracts shall be deemed voided, cancelled
and discharged in their entirety. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.14 and in
Section 7.15, Sellers shall cause all intercompany balances between and among
any Acquired Company, on the one hand, and a Seller or any Affiliate thereof
(other than any Acquired Company), on the other hand, to be eliminated by
capital contribution, discharge or otherwise in their entirety upon the
Closing, in each case, in compliance with applicable Law and effective prior
to the Closing without any Liability to or by any Acquired Company.

 

Section 7.15DPLTA Matters

 

.

 

(a)At the Closing, Buckeye Germany shall deliver a termination notice to the
German Company with respect to the DPLTA as set forth in Section 4.2(a)(vii).

 

(b)With respect to the settlement of the DPLTA for the period beginning on the
first day of the financial year during which the Closing Date occurs and
ending on, and including, the Closing Date (such period, the "DPLTA Stub
Period"), the Parties agree as follows:

  (i)In the Closing Statement to be delivered to Purchaser pursuant to Section
3.3, Sellers shall set forth their good faith estimate of either (A) the
amount of the Profit Compensation (if any) owed by the German Company to
Buckeye Germany for the DPLTA Stub Period plus applicable interest until the
time of the expected settlement (the "Estimated Profit Transfer Amount") or
(B) the amount of the Loss Compensation (if any) owed by Buckeye Germany for
the DPLTA Stub Period plus applicable interest until the time of the expected
settlement (the "Estimated Loss Transfer Amount"), in Euros and converted to
U.S. dollars in accordance with the currency exchange methodology set forth in
the Agreed Principles.

 

(ii)Purchaser shall cause the German Company to prepare and complete, within
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, financial accounts of the German
Company for the DPLTA Stub Period (the "DPLTA Settlement Accounts"), which
accounts shall be prepared in accordance with Applicable Local GAAP and
consistent with the past practices of the German Company, including by
applying the policies, procedures, practices and elections applied in
connection with the preparation of the annual financial accounts of the German
Company prior to the date of the preparation of the DPLTA Settlement Accounts
on a consistent basis, in each case, subject to Applicable Local GAAP.
Buckeye Germany shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide such support
to the German Company as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser in the
preparation of the DPLTA Settlement Accounts at no cost to the German Company
or Purchaser; provided that any such support shall only be upon reasonable
notice and in compliance with all applicable Laws and shall not unreasonably
disrupt personnel and operations of the business of Buckeye Germany or its
Affiliates. Purchaser shall cause the DPLTA Settlement Accounts to be
delivered to Buckeye Germany within ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date. Buckeye Germany shall have the right to review the DPLTA Settlement
Accounts and Section 3.4(c) and Section 3.4(d) shall apply mutatis mutandis
with respect to the finalization of the DPLTA Settlement Accounts.

 

(iii)Within five (5) Business Days following the finalization of the DPLTA
Settlement Accounts in accordance with Section 7.15(b)(ii), Buckeye Germany
and Purchaser shall take the following actions:

 

(A)If, as finally determined pursuant to the DPLTA Settlement Accounts,
Buckeye Germany is entitled to a Profit Compensation for the DPLTA Stub
Period, then (x) Purchaser shall cause the German Company to pay to Buckeye
Germany, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as
may be designated by Buckeye Germany, an amount equal to the amount of the
Profit Compensation (plus applicable interest) to which Buckeye Germany is
entitled for the DPLTA Stub Period, as determined pursuant to the final DPLTA
Settlement Accounts (net of any applicable withholding Taxes) and (y) the
following payment shall be made by Buckeye Germany to Purchaser or by
Purchaser to Buckeye Germany, as applicable:

 

(I)if the Profit Compensation (plus applicable interest) to which Buckeye
Germany is entitled for the DPLTA Stub Period (without reduction for any Taxes
withheld by the German Company on the

  payment made to Buckeye Germany) exceeds the Estimated Profit Transfer Amount,
then Buckeye Germany shall pay to Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account as may be designated in writing by Purchaser,
such excess amount and such payment by Buckeye Germany shall be treated as a
decrease of the Purchase Price; or

 

(II)if the Estimated Profit Transfer Amount exceeds the Profit Compensation
(plus applicable interest) to which Buckeye Germany is entitled for the DPLTA
Stub Period (without reduction for any Taxes withheld by the German Company on
the payment made to Buckeye Germany), then Purchaser shall pay to Buckeye
Germany, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as
may be designated in writing by Buckeye Germany, such excess amount and such
payment by Purchaser shall be treated as an increase of the Purchase Price; or

 

(III)if Sellers notified Purchaser of an Estimated Loss Transfer Amount, then
Buckeye Germany shall pay to Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account as may be designated in writing by Purchase,
an amount equal to the Profit Compensation (plus applicable interest) to which
Buckeye Germany is entitled for the DPLTA Stub Period (without reduction for
any Taxes withheld by the German Company on the payment made to Buckeye
Germany) plus the Estimated Loss Transfer Amount and such payment by Buckeye
Germany shall be treated as a decrease of the Purchase Price.

 

(B)If, as finally determined pursuant to the DPLTA Settlement Accounts, the
German Company is entitled to a Loss Compensation for the DPLTA Stub Period,
then (x) Buckeye Germany shall pay to the German Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account as may be designated by Purchaser,
an amount equal to the amount of the Loss Compensation (plus applicable
interest) to which the German Company is entitled for the DPLTA Stub Period,
as determined pursuant to the final DPLTA Settlement Accounts and (y) the
following payment shall be made by Purchaser to Buckeye Germany or by Buckeye
Germany to Purchaser, as applicable:

 

(I)if the amount of the Loss Compensation (plus applicable interest) to which
the German Company is entitled for the DPLTA Stub Period exceeds the Estimated
Loss Transfer Amount, then Purchaser shall pay to Buckeye Germany, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account as may be designated
in writing by Buckeye Germany, such excess amount and such payment by
Purchaser shall be treated as an increase of the Purchase Price; or

 

(II)if the Estimated Loss Transfer Amount exceeds the amount of the Loss
Compensation (plus applicable interest) to which the German Company is
entitled for the DPLTA Stub Period, then Buckeye

  Germany shall pay to Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account as may be designated in writing by Purchaser, such
excess amount and such payment by Buckeye Germany shall be treated as a
decrease of the Purchase Price; or

 

(III)if Sellers notified Purchaser of an Estimated Profit Transfer Amount,
then Purchaser shall pay to Buckeye Germany, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account as may be designated in writing by Buckeye
Germany, an amount equal to the Loss Compensation (plus applicable interest)
to which the German Company is entitled for the DPLTA Stub Period plus the
Estimated Profit Transfer Amount and such payment by Purchaser shall be
treated as an increase of the Purchase Price.

 

(iv)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the German Company's
right to receive any Loss Compensation or its obligation to pay any Profit
Compensation shall not be included in the determination of Company Closing
Cash, Company Closing Indebtedness or Closing Net Working Capital.

 

(v)If at the Effective Time, the statutory financial statements of the German
Company for a financial year ending prior to the Effective Time shall not have
already been prepared, audited and adopted and the Profit Compensation or Loss
Compensation, as the case may be, for such financial year (plus applicable
interest) shall not have already been settled for such financial year, then
this Section 7.15(b) shall apply mutatis mutandis with respect to such
settlement. For the avoidance of doubt, in such event, the good faith
estimate of the Estimated Profit Transfer Amount or the Estimated Loss
Transfer Amount, as the case may be, to be set forth in the Closing Statement
pursuant to Section 7.15(b)(i) shall also reflect the estimated Profit
Compensation (plus applicable interest) or Loss Compensation (plus applicable
interest) for such prior financial year.

 

(c)If, following the Closing, the financial statements of the German Company
have to be amended pursuant to Section 14 para. 1 no. 3 sentence 4 of the
German Corporate Income Tax Act (Korperschaftsteuergesetz), then, in order to
ensure the recognition of the fiscal unity, Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the German Company to amend as
promptly as reasonably practicable such financial statements in accordance
with Buckeye Germany's reasonable instruction, including any consequential
amendments to be made in any other financial statements resulting from such
amendments. Buckeye Germany shall reimburse Purchaser for all out-of-pocket
costs reasonably incurred in connection with such amendments. If and to the
extent any amendments of past financial statements of the German Company
result in a deviation between the amounts of the Profit Compensation
previously received by Buckeye Germany or the Loss Compensation previously
received by the German Company, and the amounts that should have been paid or
settled under the DPLTA for any financial year prior to the Closing Date, then
the following shall apply:

 

(i)For each financial year that requires an amendment of the financial
statements of the German Company which amendment results in a decrease of the
Profit

  Compensation which should have been paid by the German Company to Buckeye
Germany under the DPLTA (as compared to the Profit Compensation actually
paid), (A) Buckeye Germany shall make a payment to the German Company, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account as may be designated
in writing by Purchaser, in an amount (plus applicable interest) equal to (I)
the Profit Compensation that was actually paid by the German Company minus
(II) the Profit Compensation that should have initially been paid by the
German Company and (B) within two (2) Business Days after the payment
contemplated in clause (A) has been made, Purchaser shall pay an equal amount
to Buckeye Germany, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account as may be designated in writing by Buckeye Germany. The payment in
clause (B) of this subsection (i) shall be treated as an increase of the
Purchase Price.

 

(ii)For each financial year that requires an amendment of the financial
statements of the German Company which amendment results in an increase of the
Loss Compensation which should have been received by the German Company from
Buckeye Germany under the DPLTA (as compared to the Loss Compensation actually
received), (A) Buckeye Germany shall make a payment to the German Company, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as may be
designated in writing by Purchaser, in an amount (plus applicable interest)
equal to (I) the Loss Compensation that should have been received by the
German Company minus (II) the Loss Compensation that was actually received by
the German Company and (B) within two (2) Business Days after the payment
contemplated in clause (A) has been made, Purchaser shall pay an equal amount
to Buckeye Germany, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account as may be designated in writing by Buckeye Germany. The payment in
clause (B) of this subsection (ii) shall be treated as an increase of the
Purchase Price.

 

(iii)For each financial year that requires an amendment of the financial
statements of the German Company which amendment results in an increase of the
Profit Compensation which should have been paid by the German Company to
Buckeye Germany under the DPLTA (as compared to the Profit Compensation
actually paid), (A) Purchaser shall cause the German Company to make a payment
to Buckeye Germany, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account as may be designated in writing by Buckeye Germany, in an amount (plus
applicable interest) equal to (I) the Profit Compensation that should have
been paid by the German Company minus (II) the Profit Compensation that was
actually paid by the German Company and (B) within two (2) Business Days after
the payment contemplated in clause (A) has been made, Buckeye Germany shall
pay an equal amount to Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account as may be designated in writing by Purchaser. The
payment in clause (B) of this subsection (iii) shall be treated as a decrease
of the Purchase Price.

 

(iv)For each financial year that requires an amendment of the financial
statements of the German Company which amendment results in a decrease in the
Loss Compensation which should have been received by the German Company from
Buckeye Germany under the DPLTA (as compared to the Loss Compensation
initially received), (A) Purchaser shall cause the German Company to make a
payment to Buckeye Germany, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such account as may be

  designated in writing by Buckeye Germany, in an amount (plus applicable
interest) equal to (I) the Loss Compensation that was actually received by the
German Company minus (II) the Loss Compensation that should have been received
by the German Company and (B) within two (2) Business Days after the payment
contemplated in clause (A) has been made, Buckeye Germany shall pay an equal
amount to Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account as may be designated in writing by Purchaser. The payment in clause
(B) of this subsection (iv) shall be treated as a decrease of the Purchase
Price.

 

(v)For each financial year that requires an amendment of the financial
statements of the German Company which amendment results in a Profit
Compensation (instead of a Loss Compensation) which should have been paid by
the German Company to Buckeye Germany under the DPLTA (instead of the Loss
Compensation actually paid by Buckeye Germany to the German Company), (A)
Purchaser shall cause the German Company to make a payment to Buckeye Germany,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as may be
designated in writing by Buckeye Germany, in an amount (plus applicable
interest) equal to (I) the Loss Compensation that was actually received by the
German Company plus (II) the Profit Compensation that should have been paid by
the German Company and (B) within two (2) Business Days after the payment
contemplated in clause (A) has been made, Buckeye Germany shall pay an equal
amount to Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account as may be designated in writing by Purchaser. The payment in clause
(B) of this subsection (v) shall be treated as a decrease of the Purchase
Price.

 

(vi)For each financial year that requires an amendment of the financial
statements of the German Company which amendment results in a Loss
Compensation (instead of a Profit Compensation) which should have been paid by
Buckeye Germany to the German Company under the DPLTA (instead of the Profit
Compensation actually paid by the German Company to Buckeye Germany), (A)
Buckeye Germany shall make a payment to the German Company, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to such account as may be designated in writing
by Purchaser, in an amount (plus applicable interest) equal to (I) the Profit
Compensation that was actually paid by the German Company plus (II) the Loss
Compensation that should have been received by the German Company and (B)
within two (2) Business Days after the payment contemplated in clause (A) has
been made, Purchaser shall pay an equal amount to Buckeye Germany, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account as may be designated
in writing by Buckeye Germany. The payment in clause (B) of this subsection
(vi) shall be treated as a decrease of the Purchase Price.

 

(d)From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Buckeye Germany from and against, and shall pay and reimburse Buckeye
Germany for, any payment made by Buckeye Germany to the German Company for
settling any Liability resulting from the DPLTA raised after the Closing Date
but relating to the period prior to, and including, the date of the effective
termination of the DPLTA which Liability is not subject to the adjustment
contemplated by Section 7.15(b) or Section 7.15(c).

  (e)From and after the Closing, Buckeye Germany shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Purchaser from and against, and shall pay and reimburse
Purchaser for, any payment made by the German Company to Buckeye Germany for
settling any Liability resulting from the DPLTA raised after the Closing Date
but relating to the period prior to, and including, the date of the effective
termination of the DPLTA which Liability is not subject to the adjustment
contemplated by Section 7.15(b) or Section 7.15(c).

 

(f)From and after the Closing, in the event that creditors of the German
Company request that Buckeye Germany provide collateral in accordance with
Section 303 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), Purchaser
shall, upon reasonable request by Buckeye Germany, provide such collateral on
behalf of Buckeye Germany and fully satisfy any such creditor's claims for the
provision of security unless such creditor's claims are with respect to
Liabilities that would be the obligation of Sellers under Article IX of this
Agreement.

 

Section 7.16Taxes

 

.

 

(a)Tax Returns.

 

(i)Each Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies with respect to Tax
periods ending on or before the Closing Date (each, a "Pre-Closing Tax
Return"). Each Pre-Closing Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with relevant past practices unless a different treatment of any item is
required by applicable Law. For Pre-Closing Tax Returns filed after the
Closing, Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser drafts
of any such Pre-Closing Tax Return not less than 20 days before the due date
thereof (taking into account any applicable extensions) and Sellers shall
consider in good faith any reasonable comments received by Purchaser not less
than 10 days after Purchaser's receipt of such Pre-Closing Tax Return.

 

(ii)Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns for each Acquired Company for any Tax period
beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date
(each, a "Straddle Period"). Purchaser will make available to Sellers drafts
of any such Tax Return for their review and comment not less than 20 days
before the due date thereof (taking into account any applicable extensions)
and Purchaser shall consider any reasonable comments received by Sellers no
later than 10 days after Sellers' receipt of such Tax Return. All such Tax
Returns for Straddle Periods will be prepared in a manner consistent with
relevant past practices unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

(iii)Without the prior written consent of Sellers (such approval not to be
unreasonably, withheld, conditioned, or delayed), Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, (A) amend any Tax Return filed with respect
to any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date or
(B) make any Tax election that has retroactive effect to any such Tax period
(or portion thereof). In addition, without the prior written consent of
Sellers, Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of its
Affiliates (including any Acquired Company) to take any action with respect to
the

  Acquired Companies at or after the Closing on the Closing Date that is outside
the Ordinary Course of Business (other than explicitly contemplated by this
Agreement).

 

(b)Promptly upon written demand from Purchaser (but not earlier than five days
prior to the due date of the applicable Tax, taking into account any available
extensions or postponements of the due date for payment of the applicable Tax
available under applicable Law), Sellers will pay or cause to be paid (or
reimburse or cause to be reimbursed, as the case may be) to Purchaser the full
amount of all Taxes, with respect to any Acquired Company, paid or required to
be paid and attributable (under the principles of Section 7.16(c)) to any Tax
period (or the portion of any Straddle Period) ending on or before the Closing
Date (a "Pre-Closing Tax Period") including for Tax Returns described in
Section 7.16(a). Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.16 or Article
IX, Purchaser will be responsible for all Taxes of the Acquired Companies for
any Tax period, or the portion of any Straddle Period (as determined in
accordance with Section 7.16(c)), that begins after the Closing Date. Upon
the written request of Sellers, Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with
Sellers to obtain any extensions of due dates for Tax Returns or payments of
Taxes obtained in the Ordinary Course of Business and consistent with past
practice.

 

(c)In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period that extends from before the Closing Date
through and including the Closing Date (a "Pre Closing Straddle Period"),
which will be the responsibility of Sellers under Section 7.16(b), will be
deemed to be: (i) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as
real or personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis,
the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period, and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of
Taxes not described in clause (i) above (such as Taxes that are based upon or
related to income or receipts, specific transactions, or imposed in connection
with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal,
tangible or intangible)), the amount of any such Taxes will be deemed equal to
the amount which would be payable if such Tax period ended on the Closing
Date. Exemptions, allowances, deductions or credits that are calculated on an
annual basis will be allocated between the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the
remaining portion of the Straddle Period after the Closing Date in proportion
to the number of days in each such portion. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, any deductions or expenses incurred by a Seller or Acquired
Company as a result of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be reflected in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period.

 

(d)Purchaser shall pay to Sellers or their designated Affiliate or Affiliates
any refunds of Taxes with respect to any Acquired Company that relate to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, net of any Taxes payable by Purchaser or any Affiliate
thereof which result from the receipt of such refund other than any refunds
that relate to the carryback of any net operating loss or other tax attribute
that is attributable to a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date, which shall be property of Purchaser. Upon a Seller's
reasonable request and at such Seller's expense, Purchaser shall file (or
cause to be filed) all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns) or other
documents claiming any refunds. Purchaser shall make payment of any such
refund described in this Section 7.16(d) within 10 Business Days of the actual
receipt of

  such refund, provided that if such refund is subsequently denied by a Tax
Authority, Sellers shall repay the amount of the denied refund (plus any
penalties or interest) to Purchaser within 10 Business Days of notification by
Purchaser.

 

(e)The Parties will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by any other Party, in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax
Return or claim for refund and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to any Tax Return described in this Section 7.16. Purchaser, on the
one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, will provide the other with the
information that the other is required to report pursuant to Section 6043 of
the Code and will provide the other with any available records or information
that may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other
proceedings. Such assistance will include making employees available on a
reasonable and mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, (i) none of Purchaser, any Affiliate of
Purchaser or any Representative of Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof will be
entitled to review the Tax Returns of any Seller or Affiliate (other than the
Acquired Companies and other than existing pro forma portions that solely
relate to the Acquired Companies) thereof for any purpose, including in
connection with any Tax Claim or other dispute (whether among the Parties or
involving third Persons) or otherwise and (ii) none of Sellers, any Affiliate
of Sellers or any Representative of Sellers or any Affiliate thereof will be
entitled to review the Tax Returns of any Purchaser or Affiliate (other than
Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for Straddle Periods) thereof for any
purpose, including in connection with any Tax Claim or other dispute (whether
among the Parties or involving third Persons).

 

(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all applicable
Transfer Taxes payable in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser and fifty
percent (50%) by Sellers, regardless of on whom the Transfer Taxes are levied.
Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed when due by
the Party primarily or customarily responsible under the applicable Law for
filing such Tax Returns, and such Party will use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide such Tax Returns; provided that the Parties shall cooperate
with each other in any mutually agreeable manner and in compliance with the
applicable Law to minimize such Transfer Taxes. The non-filing Party shall
pay the filing Party its fifty percent (50%) portion of the relevant Transfer
Taxes shown as due at least two days prior to the due date for such Tax
Return. No later than five (5) days following receipt of a request from the
other Party, Sellers shall provide Purchaser, and Purchaser shall provide
Sellers, with any documentation or information requested by Purchaser or
Sellers, as applicable, to enable Purchaser and Sellers to notify the
appropriate Governmental Body regarding German real estate transfer taxes.

 

(g)Purchaser shall make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with
respect to the Italian Equity Interest and the French Equity Interests.

 

(h)Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall, to the extent legally able to do
so, make a timely and valid election pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
301.7701-3 to treat the German Company as an entity disregarded as separate
from its sole shareholder with an effective date no later than one day prior
to the Closing Date. To the extent Sellers are unable to legally make a
timely and valid election pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3

  with respect to the German Company, Purchaser shall be entitled to make an
election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the German Equity
Interests.

 

(i)With respect to any inquiries, audits, or similar proceedings by any Tax
Authority with respect to any Acquired Company (a "Tax Claim") relating to a
Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date (other than an IP Tax Claim
(as defined below)), Sellers shall be entitled to control all proceedings and
may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including
selection of counsel) at its own expense, although Purchaser shall have the
right to participate in such proceedings (at its own expense) provided that
Sellers shall not settle or compromise any such Tax Claim without the prior
written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such settlement or compromise could have
an adverse effect on Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) for a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date. With respect to any inquiries, audits, or similar proceedings by any
Tax Authority for which Purchaser may have an indemnification obligation under
Section 9.3(a)(iii)(B) (an "IP Tax Claim"), Purchaser shall be entitled to
control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with
such IP Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) at its own expense,
although Sellers shall have the right to participate in such proceedings (at
their own expense) provided that Purchaser shall not settle or compromise any
such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Sellers (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such settlement
or compromise could have an adverse effect on Sellers and their Affiliates for
a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. With
respect to Tax Claims relating to a Straddle Tax Period (other than an IP Tax
Claim), to the extent possible, Tax Liabilities will be distinguished and
Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall control the
defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is or they are so liable,
although the other shall have the right to participate in such proceedings (at
its or their own expense); provided that the Party controlling the defense and
settlement shall not settle or compromise such Tax Claim without the prior
written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). To the extent a Tax Liability cannot be so
attributed, Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand,
whichever has the greater potential Liability (taking into account the impact
on subsequent Tax periods), shall control the defense and settlement, although
the other shall have the right to participate in such proceedings (at its or
their own expense). Purchaser shall control at its own expense all
proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Tax period beginning
after the Closing Date. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other
hand, shall promptly notify the other if it decides or they decide not to
control the defense or settlement of any Tax Claim or IP Tax Claim which it is
or they are entitled to control pursuant to this Agreement, and the other
shall thereupon be permitted to defend and settle such Tax Claim or IP Tax
Claim at its or their own expense.

 

(j)As promptly as practicable but no later than 60 days after the date on
which the amounts of Net Working Capital, Closing Company Cash and Closing
Company Indebtedness are finally determined pursuant to Section 3.4, Purchaser
will deliver to Sellers (A) an allocation of the Purchase Price among the
French Equity Interests, the Italian Equity Interest and the German Equity
Interest, (B) a further allocation of the Purchase Price (I) allocated to the
German Equity Interest pursuant to clause (A) among the assets of the German
Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt, each IP Agreement, on the
basis of the Third-Party IP Valuation) and (II) allocated to the French Equity
Interests or the Italian Equity

  Interest pursuant to clause (A), to the extent an election under Section
338(g) of the Code is made with respect to such Acquired Company, among the
assets of the relevant Acquired Company (together, the "Allocation"), and (C)
a third-party valuation of the IP Agreements prepared by an independent expert
mutually acceptable to the Parties (the "Third-Party IP Valuation"). Prior to
the delivery of the Third-Party IP Valuation by Purchaser to Sellers, each of
Purchaser and Sellers shall have the opportunity to review a draft of the
Third-Party IP Valuation and promptly provide any reasonable comments to the
mutually agreeable independent expert for consideration by such expert.
Following the delivery of the Third-Party IP Valuation, Sellers and Purchaser
acknowledge and agree that the Third-Party IP Valuation shall be final and
binding (the "Final GP Nonwovens IP Value" and the "Final Buckeye Germany IP
Value," respectively), except as required pursuant to a final determination by
a Tax Authority. If Sellers disagree with the proposed Allocation, Sellers
may, within 60 days of receipt of the proposed Allocation, notify Purchaser of
their disagreement (provided, that if no notification of disagreement is made
within such period, the Allocation as proposed by Purchaser will be final and
binding on Purchaser and Sellers); provided, however, that, for the avoidance
of doubt, Sellers may not disagree with the Third-Party IP Valuation.
Purchaser and Sellers shall, during the 15 days following any such
notification of disagreement, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the Allocation. If Purchaser and Sellers are unable to agree to
the Allocation within such period, the dispute shall be resolved by the
Accounting Referee. The determination of the Accounting Referee with respect
to the Allocation will be final and binding on Purchaser and Sellers, and
Purchaser and Sellers shall equally bear the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Referee provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Accounting
Referee will not change the Third-Party IP Valuation. The Allocation shall be
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law).
Purchaser and Sellers will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates not
to, take a position in any forum that is inconsistent with the Allocation,
including taking an inconsistent position on any Tax Return, before any Tax
Authority, or in any action relating to any Tax, except as required pursuant
to a final determination by a Tax Authority.

 

(k)As described in Section 7.2(c), (a) Buckeye Germany will enter into the
Copyright Assignment Agreement with the German Company in exchange for a
payment by the German Company of cash or a cash receivable in an amount equal
to the Estimated Buckeye Germany IP Value prior to Closing and (b) GP
Nonwovens will enter into the GP Nonwovens IP Agreements with the German
Company prior to Closing in exchange for a payment by the German Company of
cash or a cash receivable in an amount equal to the Estimated GP Nonwovens IP
Value, in each case, which amount shall be subject to the IP Value Adjustment
post-Closing. 

 

(i)No later than 60 days after the date of this Agreement, GP Nonwovens shall
deliver to Purchaser a good faith estimate of the estimated fair market value
of the GP Nonwovens IP Agreements (the "Estimated GP Nonwovens IP Value") and
Buckeye Germany shall deliver to Purchaser a good faith estimate of the
estimated fair market value of the Copyright Assignment Agreement (the
"Estimated Buckeye Germany IP Value"). The Estimated GP Nonwovens IP Value
and the Estimated Buckeye Germany IP Value shall be subject to reasonable
review by Purchaser, and Sellers shall provide Purchaser with any reasonably
requested information that supports the calculation of the Estimated GP
Nonwovens IP Value and the Estimated Buckeye

  Germany IP Value. For the avoidance of doubt, the Estimated GP Nonwovens IP
Value and the Estimated Buckeye Germany IP Value as determined pursuant to
this Section 7.16(k) shall not govern, and Section 7.16(j) shall govern, the
allocation of the Purchase Price to the IP Agreements.

 

(ii)No later than 10 days following the final determination of the Final GP
Nonwovens IP Value, the IP Value Adjustment will be made by Sellers. Pursuant
to the IP Value Adjustment, it being understood that the German Company will
be deemed to have assigned its rights and obligations under the IP Value
Adjustment to Buckeye Germany at the Closing, (A) to the extent the Final GP
Nonwovens IP Value exceeds the Estimated GP Nonwovens IP Value, Buckeye
Germany shall pay GP Nonwovens cash or a cash receivable in an amount equal to
the excess and (B) to the extent the Estimated GP Nonwovens IP Value exceeds
the Final GP Nonwovens IP Value, GP Nonwovens shall pay Buckeye Germany cash
or a cash receivable in an amount equal to the excess.

 

(l)Prior to the Closing, upon written request from Purchaser received
reasonably in advance of the Closing, Sellers shall cause the Acquired
Companies to terminate any outstanding powers of attorney listed on Schedule
5.8 or other general authorities of representation (Prokura) granted by the
Acquired Companies.

 

Section 7.17Insurance

 

. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each
Acquired Company not to, assert any right, title or interest in, to or under
any insurance policies (other than those under which only Acquired Companies
are the insureds) or rights to proceeds thereof in effect on or prior to the
Closing Date relating to any Acquired Company.

 

Section 7.18Mutual Releases

 

.

 

(a)From and after the Closing, except as otherwise required by Law and to the
extent within Purchaser's reasonable power, Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause the Acquired Companies and its and their respective Affiliates not to,
assert any claims, or take or bring any Action, against any Seller or
Affiliate thereof or any (managing) director or officer of any Acquired
Company, in relation to any Liability, in law, equity or otherwise, based
upon, arising out of or related to any breach by any Seller or any (managing)
director or officer of any Acquired Company of any fiduciary duty in their
capacity as an equityholder, (managing) director or officer of any Acquired
Company that existed or occurred at any time from the beginning of time
through the Closing Date; provided that nothing in this Section 7.18(a) shall
affect any rights or obligations of any Person under this Agreement.

 

(b)Effective as of the Closing, except as otherwise required by Law, each
Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably releases the Acquired Companies and each of their respective
(managing) directors and officers from any and all Liabilities, and hereby
agrees not to, and to cause its Affiliates not to, assert any claims, or take
or bring any Action, against any such Person, based upon, arising out of or
relating to any Seller's capacity as an equityholder of any Acquired Company
or otherwise; provided that nothing in this Section 7.18(b) shall affect any
rights or obligations of any Person under this Agreement.

  Section 7.19Pre-Closing Cash Management

 

. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall effect actions by the German Company
with respect to the management of its cash such that the Closing Company Cash
would not reasonably be expected to be less than €5,000,000 or more than
€7,000,000; provided that any such cash management actions shall be subject to
Purchaser's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
For the avoidance of doubt, all such cash management actions shall be in
compliance with applicable Law.

 

Section 7.20Cooperation relating to Financial Statements

 

.

 

(a)With respect to the audited financial statements of the German Company, as
of and for the year ending December 31, 2018, which will be prepared and

5.6(b) (the "2018 German Audited Financial Statements"):

 

(i)if the Closing occurs after March 31, 2019, Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver the 2018 German Audited Financial Statements to
Purchaser as promptly as practical and in any event at or prior to the

(ii)if the Closing occurs after January 1, 2019 and on or prior to March 31,
2019 and the 2018 German Audited Financial Statements have not yet been
finalized, audited and adopted or if the Closing occurs after March 31, 2019
and Sellers have not yet delivered the 2018 German Audited Financial
Statements pursuant to Section 7.20(a)(i), Sellers shall promptly provide
Purchaser with such cooperation as Purchaser may reasonably request in
connection with Purchaser's effort with respect to the timely preparation and
audit of the 2018 German Audited Financial Statements such that they will be
completed in fully compliant form in time for filing with the relevant
Governmental Body as required by applicable German Law.

 

(b)Both before and after the Closing, Sellers shall promptly provide Purchaser
with such cooperation as Purchaser may reasonably request in connection with
Purchaser's effort with respect to the timely preparation and audit or review

statements of the Acquired Companies and related footnotes and (ii) pro forma
financial statements and related footnotes of Purchaser Parent giving effect
to the acquisition of the German Company, in each case, prepared in accordance
with GAAP, audited (in the case of the audited annual financial statements
only) in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States, and in form and substance compliant with the applicable requirements
of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and as Purchaser shall
otherwise reasonably consider necessary or advisable in connection with
Purchaser Parent's public reporting obligations, including any Current Report

(c)Sellers' compliance with Section 7.20(a)(i) and any cooperation to be
provided by Sellers pursuant to Section 7.20(a)(ii) or Section 7.20(b) shall

Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Sellers for all fees and expenses of
external accountants incurred by any Seller or Affiliate thereof in

  connection with the preparation and audit of the 2018 German Audited Financial
Statements that are in excess of the amount of such fees and expenses paid by
Sellers and their respective Affiliates for the preparation and audit of the
audited financial statements of the German Company for the year ending
December 31, 2017 (as adjusted for inflation or ordinary fee increases of the
auditors). Cooperation to be provided by Sellers pursuant to Section
7.20(a)(ii) or Section 7.20(b) shall include such access to relevant corporate
books, records, accounts and audit work papers, assistance from management and
other personnel and furnishing of management representation letters and

shall only be required to provide such cooperation, access and assistance (i)
during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to Sellers and

none of Sellers and their respective Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies prior to the Closing) shall have any responsibility for, or incur
any Liability to any Person with respect to the cooperation provided by
Sellers pursuant to Section 7.20(a)(ii) or Section 7.20(b) or the financial
statements contemplated thereby and (ii) shall indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers and each of the other Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any
and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of them relating to, resulting from
or arising out of such cooperation or financial statements (it being expressly

event, within sixty (60) days following the date hereof. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the services to be provided pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement will be provided on a "cost basis" and for a

by the Indemnified Party and, if known, the estimated amount of such Losses
incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party (ii) a

Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice relating to such Third Party Claim as
promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within 20 days upon
gaining knowledge of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that a failure
to timely give such notice in accordance with the foregoing provision shall
not affect the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification under this
Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially and
adversely prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented by counsel of its
choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and to
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party
Claim; provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to

if the Indemnified Party is Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries, the Third
Party Claim involves a material customer of the Acquired Companies, (iii) the
Third Party Claim is a criminal proceeding, or (iv) if the Indemnified Party
is a Purchaser Indemnified Party, the Third Party Claim has resulted in or
would reasonably be expected to result in Losses that are more than double the
amount of indemnification then available for such Third Party Claim under
Section 9.5(c). If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim, it shall
within 90 days notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party if (A) requested by the Indemnifying Party
to so participate or (B) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in connection with such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with each other
in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 9.4(b) to the
contrary, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall,
without the written consent of the other, settle or compromise any Third Party
Claim, permit a default judgment to be entered or consent to entry of a
judgment unless the settlement or compromise reached by the third Person and
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, provides
for an unqualified release of the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party,
whichever has not consented to such

  settlement or compromise, from all Liability in respect of the Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for money
damages is made by the third Person (which settlement offer provides for a
full release of the Indemnified Parties with respect to the subject matter of
the Third Party Claim), and the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party in writing of the Indemnifying Party's willingness to accept the
settlement offer and, subject to the applicable limitations of Section 9.5,
pay the amount called for by such settlement offer, and the Indemnified Party
declines to accept such settlement offer, the Indemnified Party may continue
to contest such Third Party Claim, free of any participation by the
Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any ultimate Liability with respect to
such Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party has an obligation to pay
hereunder, subject to the applicable limitations of Section 9.5, shall be
limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement offer that the
Indemnified Party declined to accept or (B) the aggregate Losses of the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of
the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

 

Section 9.5Limitations on Indemnification

 

.

 

(a)A Purchaser Indemnified Party may assert a claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.2(a) only if the Purchaser Indemnified Party delivers to
Sellers a Claim Notice with respect thereto prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period set forth in Section 9.1. Any claim for
indemnification not timely made by a Purchaser Indemnified Party in accordance
with this Section 9.5(a), and Sellers' indemnification obligations with
respect thereto, will be irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived
by such Purchaser Indemnified Party.

 

(b)A Seller Indemnified Party may assert a claim for indemnification pursuant
to Section 9.3(a) only if the Seller Indemnified Party delivers to Purchaser a
Claim Notice with respect thereto prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period set forth in Section 9.1. Any claim for indemnification not
timely made by a Seller Indemnified Party in accordance with this Section
9.5(b), and Purchaser's indemnification obligations with respect thereto, will
be irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived by such Seller
Indemnified Party.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article IX to the contrary:

 

(i)except for claims based on Fraud, Sellers shall not have any
indemnification obligations under Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than with respect
to breaches of Seller Fundamental Representations or representations and
warranties contained in Section 5.8 (Taxes)), (A) for any individual claim
(with all claims arising out of substantially the same facts being aggregated
for such purpose) where the Loss relating thereto is less than $45,000 (the
"De Minimis Amount") or (B) in respect of claims where the Loss relating
thereto is equal to or greater than the De Minimis Amount, unless the
aggregate amount of the Losses relating to all such claims exceeds $1,850,000,
and then only to the extent of such excess;

  (ii)in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses to be paid by Sellers
under Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to breaches of Seller
Fundamental Representations or representations and warranties contained in
Section 5.8 (Taxes)) exceed $18,500,000;

 

(iii)Sellers shall not have any indemnification obligations under Section
9.2(a)(iii) for any individual claim (with all claims arising out of
substantially the same facts being aggregated for such purpose) where the Loss
relating thereto is less than the De Minimis Amount; and

 

(iv)in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses to be paid by Sellers
pursuant to this Agreement (other than pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(vi) or
Section 7.15) exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price.

 

(d)Sellers shall be deemed to have not breached any representation or warranty
contained in Article V as a consequence of the existence of any fact,
circumstance or event that is disclosed on any Schedule to this Agreement,
whether or not such Schedule includes a cross-reference to the specific
Section containing such representation or warranty or the specific Section
containing such representation or warranty includes a reference to such
Schedule, so long as the applicability of such disclosure to such
representation or warranty is readily apparent on its face.

 

(e)No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under
this Article IX for any amount to the extent such amount is reflected in an
adjustment to the Purchase Price as provided in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. No
Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under Section
9.2(a)(i) with respect to any breach of a representation or warranty of
Sellers contained in Article V that results from (i) an action taken after the
date of this Agreement with the written consent, or at the written request, of
Purchaser or (ii) an action not taken with the written consent, or at the
written request, of Purchaser.

 

(f)The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article IX shall be (i) net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party, using its commercially reasonable efforts, under insurance
policies or otherwise and (ii) net of any Tax benefits to the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Losses that are actually realized by the
Indemnified Party (it being understood that such Tax benefits are to be
calculated net of any Tax costs of the Indemnified Party with respect to the
accrual or receipt of the indemnity payment that are actually incurred by the
Indemnified Party).

 

(g)All Materiality Qualifications included in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement will be disregarded for purposes of
calculating the amount of Losses for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement and for purposes of determining whether a
breach of a representation or warranty has occurred.

 

(h)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in Article V, neither

  Sellers nor any other Person is making any express or implied representation
or warranty with respect to Sellers, the Acquired Companies, the Business or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Sellers disclaim any such
representations or warranties, whether made by any Seller, any Acquired
Company, any Affiliate of any Seller or Acquired Company or any Representative
of any of them. Purchaser specifically disclaims that it is relying upon or
has relied upon any such representations or warranties that may have been made
by any Person, and acknowledges and agrees that Sellers have specifically
disclaimed and do hereby specifically disclaim any other representation or
warranty made by any Person. Any claims a Purchaser Indemnified Party may
have for breach of representation or warranty shall be based solely on the
representations and warranties of Sellers contained in Article V. In
furtherance of the foregoing, except for the representations and warranties
contained in Article V, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, acknowledges and agrees that no Seller,
Acquired Company, Affiliate of any Seller or Acquired Company, or
Representative of any of them, nor any other Person, will have or be subject
to any Liability to a Purchaser Indemnified Party, or any other Person, for,
and Sellers hereby disclaim any Liability for, any representation, warranty,
projection, forecast, statement or information made, communicated or furnished
(orally or in writing) to Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser or any
Representative of any of them, including any confidential memoranda
distributed on behalf of Sellers relating to the Acquired Companies and the
Business or other publications or data room information provided to Purchaser,
any Affiliate of Purchaser or any Representative of any of them, or any other
document or information in any form provided to Purchaser, any Affiliate of
Purchaser or any Representative of any of them in connection with the sale of
the Acquired Companies Equity Interests and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including any opinion, information, projection or advice that may have
been or may be provided to Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser or any
Representative by any Representative of any Seller, Acquired Company or
Affiliate of any Seller or Acquired Company) or for Purchaser's use of any
such information.

 

(i)Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction, its own
independent investigation of each Acquired Company and its properties and
assets and the Business and, in making its determination to proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties has relied on the results of Purchaser's independent investigation.

 

Section 9.6Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments

 

. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Sellers and Purchaser agree to
treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article IX as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and non-U.S. income Tax
purposes.

 

Section 9.7Limitation on Damages

 

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Seller nor Purchaser shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person,
either in contract or in tort, for (a) any consequential, incidental or
indirect damages, including any damages based on loss of future revenue,
income or profits, diminution of value or loss of business reputation or
opportunity (except to the extent such damages are the natural, probable and
reasonably foreseeable result of the event that gave rise thereto or the
matter for which indemnification is sought hereunder and except in the case of
Fraud), or (b) special or punitive damages of such other Person, in each case,
relating to any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement; provided, however,
that the foregoing limitations shall not

  affect the right of an Indemnified Party to be indemnified pursuant to this
Article IX for Losses comprised of such damages that are awarded to a third
Person in connection with a Third Party Claim.

 

Section 9.8Exclusive Remedy

 

. Each Seller, on behalf of itself and each of the other Seller Indemnified
Parties, and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing,
the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or inaccuracy, or alleged breach
or inaccuracy, of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or any
covenant or agreement under this Agreement, shall be indemnification in
accordance with this Article IX, except (a) with respect to disputes under
Section 3.4 and Section 7.15, which will be resolved in accordance therewith,
(b) with respect to claims for specific performance in accordance with Section
10.8, and (c) in the case of Fraud. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
Seller, on behalf of itself and each of the other Seller Indemnified Parties,
and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of
contributions, if any) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any tort or breach of contract claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of or related to any representation or warranty contained in or
made in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise
in the future, that it may have against any Person based upon or arising under
any foreign, federal, state or local Law, except in the case of Fraud.

 

Article X 
MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 10.1Expenses

 

. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall
bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and each other agreement and document contemplated
by this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. All notarization, filing and registration fees and costs
incurred in connection with the transfer of the Acquired Companies Equity
Interests shall be borne by Purchaser.

 

Section 10.2Forum; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial

 

.

 

(a)The Parties agree that the appropriate, exclusive and convenient forum (the
"Forum") for any disputes based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in the Court of
Chancery in the City of Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware, except where
such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. In such event, the Forum shall
be in the federal district court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware or, in the
event such federal district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then in
the Superior Court in the City of Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware.
Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts
solely in respect of any disputes based upon, arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parties further
agree that the Parties shall not bring an Action with respect to any disputes
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in any court or

  jurisdiction other than the above specified courts; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not limit the rights of the Parties to obtain execution of
a judgment in any other jurisdiction. The Parties further agree, to the
extent permitted by Law, that a final non-appealable Order against a Party in
any Action contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any
other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the
judgment, with a certified or exemplified copy of such Order being conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

 

(b)To the extent that a Party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from
jurisdiction of any court described in Section 10.2(a) with respect to itself
or its property, such Party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in
respect of its obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to
the personal jurisdiction of each court described in Section 10.2(a).

 

(c)Each of the Parties hereby consents to process being served on such Party
in any Action contemplated by this Section 10.2 by delivery of a copy thereof

DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 10.3Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers

 

. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto), the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Joint Defense Agreement represent the entire
understanding and agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof. This Agreement can be supplemented or amended, and any
provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific
reference to this Agreement signed by the Party against whom enforcement of
any such supplement, amendment, or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant
to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of a Party,
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of
compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver
of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure
on the part of a Party to exercise, and no delay by a Party in exercising, any
right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof by such
Party, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy
by a Party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power or remedy by such Party.

 

Section 10.4Governing Law

 

. The provisions of this Agreement, the execution, performance or
nonperformance, interpretation and construction of this Agreement and all
matters based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement shall be governed by
the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws
provisions that if applied might require the application of the Laws of
another jurisdiction, except that the transfer in rem of the Acquired
Companies Equity Interests shall be governed by the respective mandatory local
law which will

  be the governing law of the transfer agreements contemplated in Section
4.2(a)(i) through Section 4.2(a)(iii). This Agreement is entered into in
express reliance by the Parties on Section 2708 of Title 6 of the Delaware
Code.

 

Section 10.5Notices

 

. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered personally by hand, (b)

delivery acknowledged by the tracking system of the applicable courier
system), or (c) when sent by electronic mail transmission (with the receipt of

Section 10.6Severability

 

. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms or
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
supplement or amend this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 10.7Binding Effect; Assignment

 

. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in
this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person other than the Parties, except as contemplated by Section
7.1, Section 7.7, Section 7.20, Section 10.12 and Article IX. No assignment
of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any
Party, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the other
Parties and any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be
void; provided, however, that Purchaser may assign its rights or obligations
hereunder to one or more of Purchaser Parent's Subsidiaries (each, a
"Purchaser Designated Subsidiary") without the prior written consent of
Sellers and any Seller may assign its rights or obligations hereunder to one
or more of its Affiliates that is wholly owned by Seller Parent without the
prior written consent of Purchaser; provided further that, if Purchaser
assigns its rights or obligations hereunder to a Purchaser Designated
Subsidiary (a) not organized in Germany to acquire the German Equity Interest,
(b) if applicable, not organized in Germany or the United States with respect
to the IP Agreements, (c) not organized in Germany, Luxembourg, or France to
acquire the French Equity Interest, or (d) not organized in Germany,
Luxembourg, or Italy to acquire the Italian Equity Interest, then if any
applicable Law requires Purchaser or a Purchaser Designated Subsidiary to
deduct and withhold Taxes from any amount otherwise payable to Sellers under
this Agreement, then, to the extent such deduction or withholding of Taxes
would not have been applicable if such assignment of rights and obligations
had not occurred, the amount payable by the Purchaser Designated Subsidiary
shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding
has been made Sellers receive an amount equal to the sum they would have
received had no such deduction or withholding been made. Unless otherwise
agreed in writing by the other Parties, no assignment of this Agreement or of
any rights or any obligations hereunder by a Party shall relieve such Party of
any of its obligations hereunder.

  Section 10.8Specific Performance

 

. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the subject matter of this
Agreement is unique, that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in
the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached, and that the
remedies at law would not be adequate to compensate any Party. Accordingly,
each Party agrees that the other Parties will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including to enforce the obligations of the Parties to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to this Agreement) in
addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled (without any
requirement that any Party provide any bond or other security). Each Party
waives any defense that a remedy at law is adequate and any requirement to
post bond or provide similar security in connection with Actions instituted
for injunctive relief or specific performance of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.9Joint and Several Liability of Sellers

 

. Sellers shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of each
Seller under this Agreement.

 

Section 10.10Non-Recourse

 

. Except for Seller Parent's and Purchaser Parent's respective obligations
under the Seller Parent Guarantee or the Purchaser Parent Guarantee, as
applicable, (a) this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or
causes of action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be made
against, the Parties and (b) no past, present or future incorporator, member,
stockholder, partner, Affiliate or Representative of any Party shall have any
responsibility for any Liabilities of any Party under this Agreement.

 

Section 10.11Counterparts

 

. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
will be deemed an original, but all of which together constitute one and the
same instrument. Signatures transmitted by facsimile or electronic mail will
be deemed originals for purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.12Waiver of Conflicts; Transaction Privilege

 

.

 

(a)Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that Jones Day (the "Seller Law
Firm") has represented Sellers and Affiliates thereof (including the Acquired
Companies) in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement, and that Sellers and Affiliates thereof (other
than the Acquired Companies) (each a "Seller Group Member" and collectively,
the "Seller Group Members") have a reasonable expectation that, after the
Closing, the Seller Law Firm will represent them in connection with any claim
or Action involving any Seller Group Member, on the one hand, and Purchaser or
any Affiliate thereof (each a "Purchaser Group Member" and collectively the
"Purchaser Group Members"), on the other hand, arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b)Subject to the letter agreement, dated as of April 26, 2018, by and among
the Seller Law Firm, Seller Parent and Purchaser Parent, Purchaser, on its own
behalf and on behalf of the other Purchaser Group Members, hereby expressly
waives and agrees not to assert any conflict of interest that may arise or be
deemed to arise under applicable Law or standard of

  professional responsibility if, after the Closing, the Seller Law Firm
represents the Seller Group Members or any of them in connection with any
claim or Action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c)In addition, each of the Parties irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that,
from and after the Closing, any attorney-client privilege arising from
communications prior to the Closing between any one or more Representatives of
the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and the Seller Law Firm, on the other
hand, to the extent related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be excluded from the property, rights, privileges, powers,
franchises and other interests held by the Acquired Companies under applicable
Law, that such attorney-client privilege shall be deemed held solely by
Sellers, and that no Purchaser Group Member shall have any right to assert,
waive or otherwise alter any such attorney-client privilege at any time after
the Closing. All communications involving attorney-client confidences between
the Seller Group Members and the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and the
Seller Law Firm, on the other hand, relating to the negotiation, documentation
and consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
Sellers for the benefit and on behalf of the Seller Group Members (and not the
Acquired Companies or Purchaser Group Members). Accordingly, the Acquired
Companies and the Purchaser Group Members shall not have access to any such
communications or to the files of the Seller Law Firm relating to such
engagement. Further, to the extent that files of the Seller Law Firm in
respect of any dispute between Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other hand, arising out of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, such files shall constitute
client property, only Sellers for the benefit and on behalf of the Seller
Group Members (and not the Purchaser Group Members) shall hold such property
rights and the Seller Law Firm shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to the Purchaser
Group Members by reason of any attorney-client relationship between the Seller
Law Firm and the Acquired Companies.

 

(d)This Section 10.12 is for the benefit of the Seller Group Members and such
Persons are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 10.12. This
Section 10.12 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this Section 10.12 may be
amended or waived without the prior written consent of Sellers (which may be
withheld for any reason).
