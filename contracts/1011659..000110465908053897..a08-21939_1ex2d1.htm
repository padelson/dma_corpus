 **RECITALS**

  

 ** **

  

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Parent and its affiliates beneficially and of
record own 90,255,980 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
the Company (the " _Common Stock_ "), constituting approximately 64.9% of the
issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock;

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc., a Japanese joint
stock corporation and the parent company of Parent (" _MUFG_ "),
have proposed to the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_
") that Parent or one of its wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries
acquire all of the shares of Common Stock not held in a proprietary (rather
than a fiduciary or bailee) capacity by MUFG or one of its Subsidiaries other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Public Shares_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company Board has established a special committee (the "
_Special Committee_ ") consisting of independent directors to consider, among
other things, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transactions_ ") and to make a
recommendation to the Company Board with respect thereto;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Special Committee has unanimously (with one member absent) (i)
determined that the terms of this Agreement and the Transactions are fair to
and in the best interests of the Company and the holders of the Public
Shares, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions, and (iii) recommended to the Company Board that the Company
Board adopt resolutions approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and
the Transactions and recommending that the holders of Public Shares accept
the Offer, tender their Public Shares to Parent pursuant to the Offer and, to
the extent any such holders do not tender their Public Shares, adopt this
Agreement (such recommendation by the Special Committee, the "
_Special Committee Recommendation_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company Board, based on the Special Committee Recommendation,
has (i) determined that the terms of this Agreement and the Transactions are
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the holders of Public

  

   

     
   

  



  

Shares, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions, and (iii) resolved to recommend to the holders of Public Shares
that they accept the Offer, tender their Public Shares to Parent pursuant to
the Offer and adopt, to the extent any such holders do not tender their
Public Shares, this Agreement (such recommendation, the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub
have (i) determined that the Transactions are fair to and in the best
interests of Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, and (ii) approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, in each case to the
extent they are a party to such Transactions;

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent is willing and intends, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, to commence a tender offer (the "
_Offer_ ") to purchase all of the outstanding Public Shares, in cash at a
price per Public Share of $73.50 (such price or any higher price per Public
Share that may be offered to be paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the seller but subject to any
required withholding of Taxes;

  



  

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including the Company Requisite
Vote), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company with the Company
as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

  



  

 **ARTICLE I**

  



  

 ** _THE OFFER AND THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME_**

  

 ** **

  

1.1 _The Offer_. (a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Parent
shall, as promptly as practicable and in no event later than ten business
days after the date hereof, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "))
the Offer at the Offer Price, net to the seller but subject to any required
withholding of Taxes.

  



  

(b) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be midnight (New York City
time) on the date that is 20 business days from the date on which the Offer
was commenced (determined as provided in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act) (the initial " _Expiration Date_ " and any expiration time and date
established pursuant to an extension of the Offer as so extended, also an "
_Expiration Date_ ").

  



  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

(c) The obligations of Parent to commence the Offer and accept for payment,
and pay for, any Public Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject
only to (i) the conditions set forth in _Exhibit 1_ and (ii) the non-
waivable condition that pursuant to the Offer, prior to the Expiration Date,
there shall have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn a number of
Public Shares which constitutes at least a majority of the outstanding Public
Shares (assuming the exercise of all options, warrants and other rights to
purchase shares of Common Stock and excluding from the numerator of such
calculation any shares held by stockholders that are affiliated with the
Company, including directors and officers of the Company, as of the
Acceptance Time) (the " _Majority-of-the-Minority Condition_ ").

  



  

(d) Parent expressly reserves the right (x) to increase the Offer Price and
(y) to waive any condition to the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer,
except that, without the consent of the Company, Parent shall not (i) reduce
the number of Public Shares subject to the Offer, (ii) except as provided in
Section 4.4, reduce the Offer Price, (iii) add to the conditions set forth in
_Exhibit 1_ or modify any condition set forth in _Exhibit 1_ in any
manner adverse to the holders of Public Shares, (iv) except as otherwise
provided in this Section 1.1(d), extend the Offer, (v) waive or modify
the Majority-of-the-Minority Condition, or (vi) change the form
of consideration payable in the Offer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent may, in its discretion, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend
the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of not more than ten
business days each, if at any otherwise scheduled Expiration Date of the
Offer any of the conditions to Parents obligation to purchase Public Shares
are not satisfied or waived, (ii) extend the Offer for the minimum period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer or (iii) make available a "subsequent offering
period" in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 14d-11. In addition, if at any
otherwise scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer any condition to the Offer
is not satisfied or waived, Parent shall extend the Offer at the request of
the Company for one or more consecutive increments of not more than ten
business days each until the earlier of the date that is 40 business days
after commencement of the Offer (the " _Outside Date_ ") and the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. In addition, Parent shall,
if requested by the Company, make available a subsequent offering period in
accordance with Exchange Act Rule 14d-11 of not less than ten business days;
_provided_ that Parent shall not be required to make available such a
subsequent offering period in the event that, prior to the commencement of
such subsequent offering period, MUFG and its Subsidiaries collectively hold
at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the requirement that
MUFG and its Subsidiaries collectively hold at least 90% of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock being the " _90% Requirement_ ").

  



  

(e) On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, Parent shall accept and pay for all Public Shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Parent becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of
the Offer.

  



  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _business day_ " shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act.

  



  

1.2 _The Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent
and, to the extent required by Law, its affiliates shall file with the SEC,
pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 14d-3 and Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_"), a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and
the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
") and shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of
Public Shares as and to the extent required by the applicable federal
securities laws, including for the avoidance of doubt the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, as amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder (collectively, the " _Securities Laws_
"). Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents with the SEC, Parent shall
deliver copies of the proposed form of the Offer Documents to the Company and
the Special Committee, and their respective counsel, within a reasonable time
for review and comment by the Company and the Special Committee, and their
respective counsel. Each of Parent and the Company agrees to use reasonable
best efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer and to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to
the extent that such information shall become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by the Securities Laws. Parent
shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and
to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of Public Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by the Securities Laws. The Company and
the Special Committee, and their respective counsel, shall be given
reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to review and comment on the
Offer Documents (including any amendments or supplements thereto) before they
are filed with the SEC or disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.
Parent shall provide the Company and the Special Committee, and their
respective counsel, with copies of any written comments, and shall inform
them of any oral comments, that Parent or its counsel receives from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt
of such comments and shall give the Company and the Special Committee, and
their respective counsel, a reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to
review and comment on any written or oral responses to such comments. The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the
Special Committee Recommendation and the Company Board Recommendation, as
such recommendations may be amended and until such recommendations may be
withdrawn, in each case as permitted by this Agreement.

  



  

1.3 _Company Actions_. (a) On the date the Offer Documents are first filed
with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer containing the Special Committee Recommendation and the Company Board

  



  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

Recommendation (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") and shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
disseminated to the holders of Public Shares with the Offer Documents, in
each case in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act
and the Securities Laws. The Company shall deliver copies of the proposed
form of the Schedule 14D-9 to Parent within a reasonable time prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC for review and comment by Parent and its counsel.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by the Securities
Laws. The Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the
Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders
of Public Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Securities Laws.  The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with
copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments,
that the Company or the Special Committee, or their respective counsel,
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after the receipt of such comments and shall give Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to review and comment on any
written or oral responses to such comments. The Company agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9.

  



  

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Parent (i) a list of the names and addresses of the
record holders of Public Shares as of the most recent practicable date, as
well as mailing labels containing such names and addresses and (ii)
security position lists, computer files and any other information identifying
the beneficial owners of Public Shares as of the most recent practicable date
that the Company or the transfer agent have in their possession or control or
can obtain without unreasonable effort or expense.  The Company will furnish
or cause to be furnished to Parent such additional information (including
updates of the items provided pursuant to the preceding sentence) and such
other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer

5   

     
   

  



  

as otherwise required by the Securities Laws. Each party shall take all steps

respect to the Schedule 13E-3 promptly after the receipt of such comments and

1.5 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease.  The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_
"), and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue
unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II.  The Merger
shall have the effects specified in the DGCL.

  



  

1.6 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective at such time that a
Certificate of Merger with respect to the Merger (the "
_Delaware Certificate of Merger_ ") has been executed, acknowledged and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, as provided in
Section 251 of the DGCL, or at such later time as may be agreed by the
parties in writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ "). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Company and Parent will cause the Merger to be effective on the third
business day (the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to
be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII shall be
satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied on the Closing Date, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions).

  



  

1.7 _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take

New York, at 9:00 A.M. on the Closing Date.

  



  

1.8 _Company Directors Prior to the Effective Time_.  If the 90% Requirement
is not satisfied immediately after such time that Parent accepts for payment
the Public

  



  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), then, from
and after the Acceptance Time until the earlier of (a) the Effective Time and
(b) such time that the 90% Requirement is satisfied, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the directors of the Company who are
"independent" within the meaning of the corporate governance rules of the New
York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (the " _Existing Independent Directors_
") to remain as directors on the Company Board. If any Existing Independent
Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or resignation, Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that such other Person (or
Persons) as may be designated by the remaining Existing Independent Directors
shall be elected or designated to fill such vacancy in accordance with the
Companys by-laws and each such Person shall be deemed to be an Existing
Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
designees on the Company Board not to approve any amendment or termination by
the Company of, or any waiver by the Company of any of its rights under, this
Agreement that would adversely affect the holders of Public Shares or extend
the time for performance of Parents or Merger Subs obligations under this
Agreement, unless such action is approved by the Existing Independent
Directors. Parent agrees that, from and after the date of this Agreement,
subject to applicable Law, at all times prior to the earlier of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement, it shall not
authorize its designees on the Company Board to terminate the existence of
the Special Committee or materially change its duties or authority or its
current membership (so long as its existing members are willing to serve and
have not been removed for cause).

 ** _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; 
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

  

 ** **

  

4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

  



  

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Public Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Public Shares owned by
the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company,
and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Public Shares
that are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have
properly perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL (each, an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to the Offer Price (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ ").
At the Effective Time, all such Public Shares shall cease to be outstanding,
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ") formerly representing such Public Shares shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares; Parent-Owned Common Stock to Remain
Outstanding_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall
be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under Section
4.2(f). Each share of Common Stock owned by MUFG or any of its Subsidiaries,
other than shares of Common Stock held by MUFG or any of its Subsidiaries in
a fiduciary or bailee capacity (which shall be deemed to be Public Shares in
accordance with the definition thereof), shall remain outstanding as shares
of the Surviving Corporation without change resulting from the Merger.

  



  



        
   

  



  

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist.

  



  

4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available or cause to be made available to a paying agent selected by Parent
with the Companys prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld
(the " _Paying Agent_ "), amounts sufficient in the aggregate to provide all
funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments of the Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (such cash hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Public Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the
Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange
for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal
to (x) the number of Public Shares represented by such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied
by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled.  No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Public Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon
due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Public Shares is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.

  



  

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Public Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for

  



  



        
   

  



  

transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this Article IV.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Public Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article
IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required
tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of
its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 4.2(e)), without any interest thereon.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Public Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization,
Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature.

  



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings)
equal to the number of Public Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  



  

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Public Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with
respect to the Public Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholders, but
instead shall be automatically cancelled and cease to exist, and each such
Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided
by Section 262 of the DGCL for such shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
any Person shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such Persons
right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the Public Shares held
by such Person shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time
into the Per Share Merger Consideration set forth in Section 4.1(a),
without interest. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable law that are received by the
Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent

  



  



        
   

  



  

of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

  



  

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Public Shares such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), as amended, or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity,
and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Public Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, (i) the term " _Tax_ " (including, with
correlative meaning, the term " _Taxes_ ") includes all federal, state, local
and foreign income, profits, franchise, gross receipts, environmental,
customs duty, capital stock, severances, stamp, payroll, sales, employment,
unemployment, disability, use, property, withholding, excise, production,
value added, occupancy and other taxes, duties or assessments of any nature
whatsoever, together with all interest, penalties and additions imposed with
respect to such amounts and any interest in respect of such penalties and
additions, and (ii) the term " _Tax Return_ " includes all returns and reports
(including elections, declarations, disclosures, schedules, estimates and
information returns) required to be supplied to a Tax authority relating to
Taxes.

  



  

4.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

  



  

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time each outstanding option to
purchase Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") under the Stock
Plans, vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the
holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Company Option times (y) the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per share of Common Stock under such Company Option less applicable Taxes
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payment.

  



  

(b) _Company Awards_.  At the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive shares of Common Stock or
benefits measured by the value of shares of Common Stock, and each award of
any kind consisting of shares of Common Stock that may be held, awarded,
outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Stock Plans and any
other Compensation Agreements and Benefit Plans, other than Company Options
and any warrants (the " _Company Awards_ "), shall be cancelled and shall only
entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (x) the

  



  



        
   

  



  

number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time times (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or,
if the Company Award provides for payments to the extent the value of the
shares of Common Stock exceed a specified reference price, the amount, if
any, which is the excess of the Per Share Merger Consideration over such
reference price), less applicable Taxes required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to such payment. " _Compensation Agreements and Benefit Plans_
" shall mean all benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or
arrangements covering current or former directors, officers or employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board (the "
_Compensation Committee_ "), as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions
of Sections 4.3(a) and 4.3(b).  The Company shall take all actions necessary
to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Common Stock or
other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement
of Company Options or Company Awards.

  



  

4.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of shares of Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Stock issued and outstanding
prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, the Offer Price and the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

5.2 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_.  Except as set forth in
the corresponding sections of the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by
the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ "), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub that:

  



  

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_.  Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as currently conducted and is qualified to do

(b) _Capital Structure_.

  



  

(i) As of August 14, 2008, the authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 300,000,000 shares of Common Stock, of which 139,009,259 shares
are outstanding, and 5,000,000 shares of $1.00 par value preferred stock,
none of which are outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. As of August 14, 2008, based on the assumptions set forth
in Section 5.1(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, other than (i)
9,616,270 shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Year 2000
UnionBanCal Corporation Management Stock Plan, as amended, and the
UnionBanCal Corporation Management Stock Plan, restated effective June 1,
1997 (the " _Stock Plans_ ") and (ii) any dividend equivalents for the
September 5, 2008 record date dividend, the Company has no shares of Common
Stock reserved for issuance. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock
or other securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of
any lien, charge, pledge, restriction, security interest, claim or other
encumbrance of any nature (each, a " _Lien_ "). Except as set forth above,
there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants,
conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or other rights of any
kind that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell
any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or
acquire, any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding.  Upon any issuance of any shares of Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of the Stock Plans, such shares will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens.
The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into
or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders
of the Company on any matter.

  



  



        
   

  



  

(ii) Union Bank of California, N.A., is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company.

  



  

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

  



  

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, subject
only, with respect to the Merger, to adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of 90% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "
_Company Requisite Vote_ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception_ ").

  



  

(ii) The Special Committee has unanimously (with one member absent) adopted
resolutions (A) determining that the terms of this Agreement and the
Transactions are fair to and in the best interest of the Company and the
holders of the Public Shares, (B) approving and declaring advisable this
Agreement and the Transactions, and (C) making the Special Committee
Recommendation.

adopted resolutions (A) determining that the terms of this Agreement and the
Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the
holders of the shares of Public Shares, (B) approving and declaring advisable
this Agreement and the Transactions, and (C) making the Company Board
Recommendation.

  



  

(iv) The Special Committee has received the written opinion of its financial
advisor, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (" _Credit Suisse_ "), to the
effect that, subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and
other matters stated therein, the $73.50 per share of Common Stock to be
received by the holders of the Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger, is
fair from a financial point of view to such holders, other than Parent and
its affiliates, a copy of which opinion will promptly be delivered to Parent,
it being agreed that Parent and its affiliates (not including the Special
Committee) have no right to rely on such opinion.

  



  

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts_.

  



  

(i) Other than the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to Section
1.6, no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by the
Company with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or

  



  



        
   

  



  

authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any Governmental
Entity, in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the Transactions, or in
connection with the continuing operation of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time.

  



  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not, constitute or
result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the comparable governing
instruments of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of
termination) or a default under, the creation or acceleration of any
obligations under, or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any agreement, lease,
license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other

therein, in each case in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistently applied during the periods involved,

supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a)

standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and
has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing
or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or
in such good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Transactions. Parent has made available to the Company a complete and
correct copy of the organizational documents of Merger Sub as in effect on
the date of this Agreement.

Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and to consummate the
Transactions that this Agreement requires it to consummate.  This Agreement

Sub from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions that this Agreement requires it to consummate, except those that
the failure to make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.

  



  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions that this Agreement requires it
to consummate will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of,
or a default under, the articles of incorporation or by-laws of MUFG, Parent
or Merger Sub or the comparable governing instruments of any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the

of the assets of MUFG, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any
Contracts binding upon MUFG, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Laws or
governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which MUFG, Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is subject; or (C) any change in the rights or
obligations of any party under any of such Contracts, except, in the case of
clause (B) or (C) above, for any breach, violation, termination, default,

Transactions that this Agreement requires it to consummate.

supplied in writing by Parent or Merger Sub or any affiliate of Parent for

13E-3 or the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time such document is filed with the
SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is first
published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or (b) the Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys stockholders
and at the time

  



  



        
   

  



  

of the Company Stockholders Meeting, or, if the Company disseminates an
Information Statement in lieu of a Proxy Statement in accordance with Section
6.5, the Information Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
Companys stockholders and on the date the Written Consent is effective,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

with the Securities Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation is
made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated
by reference in any of the foregoing documents based on information supplied
by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of

Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change, fact or condition
that is reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or of any
failure of any condition in _Exhibit 1_ or Article VII. The Company
shall not permit any of its officers or any other representatives or agents
to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the Offer, the Merger
and the other Transactions unless it consults with Parent in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives Parent the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

  



  

(e) _Rule 14d-10(c) Matters_. Prior to the Expiration Date, the Compensation
Committee will, to the extent it has not previously taken such action, (i)
approve and/or ratify all Compensation Agreements and Benefit Plans as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, and (ii) take
all other actions necessary or advisable to satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor with respect to such Compensation Agreements and
Benefit Plans in accordance with Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

  



  

6.7 _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
officers and other authorized representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to
its employees, properties, books, contracts and records and, during such
period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to Parent all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested, provided that no investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and provided, further,
that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets
of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or
(ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.7
shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the
Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

6.8 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules
and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation
of the Common Stock from the NYSE and the

  



  



        
   

  



  

deregistration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) such time as
the Company qualifies for an issuer-initiated delisting under applicable Law
and the rules and policies of the NYSE, and in any event no more than ten
(10) days after the Closing Date.

  



  

6.9 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Transactions shall
be a joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall
consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise
making public announcements with respect to the Transactions and prior to
making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity (including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation
service) with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of
any Governmental Entity; _provided_  that in no event shall Parent be
required to consult with the Company in connection with any filing with any
Japanese Governmental Entity or the Tokyo Stock Exchange or in connection
with providing any confidential information concerning Parent or any of its
affiliates to any third party or Governmental Entity.

  



  

6.10 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Public Shares are purchased pursuant to
the Offer, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except that
expenses incurred in connection with the filing fee for the Schedule TO and
the publishing, printing and/or mailing of the Offer Documents shall be borne
by Purchaser, and expenses incurred in connection with the Schedule 13E-3 and
the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as the case may be (but not
the attorneys fees related thereto, which shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense), shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company.

  



  

6.11 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a)  From and
after the Acceptance Time, and for a period of six years after the later of
the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, it will
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in
such capacity), determined as of the Acceptance Time (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, _provided_  that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.11(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation,

  



  



        
   

  



  

shall promptly notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of
any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party.  In the event of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before
or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues that raise
conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation, on the
other hand, and the Indemnified Parties, on the other, the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel
for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest; _provided_ that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid
conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
their prior written consent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final,
that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. If such indemnity is not available
with respect to any Indemnified Party, then the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Party shall contribute to the amount payable in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect relative faults and benefits.

  



  

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the individuals
serving as officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time to be covered for a period of six
(6) years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability
insurance policy maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that Parent may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than such
policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as
such; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to
expend on an annual basis more than 300% of the current amount expended by
the Company (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance
coverage, and further _provided_ that if Parent is unable to maintain or
obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.11(c) Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for
the Insurance Amount.

  



  



        
   

  



  

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
6.11.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

  



  

(f) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws or similar organizational
documents shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect to the fullest extent permitted by Law. For a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect any and all
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Companys and any of its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation and by-
laws or similar organizational documents in effect as of the date hereof or
in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any
of their respective current or former directors or officers in effect as of
the date hereof, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individuals who at the Acceptance Time were current or former directors
or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_
, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any action, litigation,
investigation, suit, arbitration or proceeding pending or asserted or any
claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such
action, litigation, investigation, suit, arbitration or proceeding or
resolution of such claim.

  



  

6.12 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, the Company
and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
Transactions.

  



  

6.13 _Tail Period_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company acknowledges and agrees that, during the six months
from and after the Acceptance Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") if and for so long
as the 90% Requirement is not satisfied, Parent is not required to take any
action to acquire Public Shares. Without limiting the foregoing, during the
Tail Period, Parent and its affiliates may (but are not required to) purchase
Public Shares on the open market and in privately negotiated

  



  



        
   

  



  

transactions in accordance with applicable Law; _provided_ that neither
Parent nor any of its affiliates may commence a "tender offer" (within the
meaning of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder) during the Tail Period without the Companys consent.  During
the Tail Period, Parent shall notify the Company in writing promptly after
the 90% Requirement is satisfied. For the avoidance of doubt, if and when
the 90% Requirement is satisfied at any time during the Tail Period, (i)
consistent with Section 6.6(b) of this Agreement but without limiting Section
8.1(f) of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this
Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions as soon as practicable and (ii) consistent with Section 4.1(a)
of this Agreement, the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in connection
with the Merger shall be equal to the Offer Price.

  



  

6.14 _Tax Certificate_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide to Parent immediately prior to the Closing a statement pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) certifying that the Company is not
a U.S. real property interest (as defined by the Code).

  



  

6.15 _Formation of Merger Sub; Accession_. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, and in any event within ten business days
after the date hereof, Parent shall form a Delaware corporation as a direct
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "). As promptly as
reasonably practicable after incorporating Merger Sub, (x) Parent, in its
capacity as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, shall approve and adopt this
Agreement and (y) Parent shall cause Merger Sub to accede to this Agreement
by executing a signature page to this Agreement, after which time Merger Sub
shall be a party hereto for all purposes set forth herein. Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, (i) the obligations of Merger Sub to
perform its covenants hereunder shall commence only at the time of its
incorporation and (ii) the representations and warranties of Merger Sub set
forth in Section 5.3 shall be deemed to have been made as though Merger Sub
had been a party to this Agreement as of the date hereof. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to
cause the Board of Directors of Merger Sub to unanimously approve this
Agreement and declare it advisable for Merger Sub to enter into
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Parent and its Affiliates may amend, or cause to be amended, the by-laws of
Merger Sub at any time prior to the Effective Time so long as such amendment
would not impair, delay or prevent the Closing.

(e) by the Company (only with the approval of the Special Committee), if
there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or

representation or warranty shall have become untrue or incorrect on any date

if curable, has not been cured before 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the
30th day after written notice thereof has been given by the Company to
Parent, or

  



  

(ii) if such breach or failure to be true occurs after the Acceptance Time

9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated July 2,
2008, between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ")
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among
the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

9.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section
6.11 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) only, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does

  



  



        
   

  



  

not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, including, without limitation, the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. Except for Section 6.11(f)
with respect to which rights of third party beneficiaries arise as of the
date of this Agreement, the parties hereto further agree that the rights of
third party beneficiaries under Section 6.11 shall not arise unless and until
the Acceptance Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are
for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with Section 9.3 without notice or liability to any other Person.
In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  



  

9.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

  



  

9.10 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term, and such definitions
shall apply regardless of where the terms appear in this Agreement. As used
in this Agreement, the terms " _beneficial ownership_ " (and its correlative
terms) and " _affiliate_ " shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in
Rule 13d-3 and Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, respectively.

  



  

9.11 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and, so long as the effect of substituting such
provision in accordance with the foregoing is no more adverse to any party
than this Agreement in the form executed as of the date hereof, (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction.

  



  



        
   

  



  

9.12 _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section
or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation."

  



  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

  



  

9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable other than by
operation of law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent may designate, by
written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which
event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such
other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; _provided_  that any such designation shall
not materially impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions or
otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement
shall be null and void.

correct as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Acceptance Time, and

purposes of this Section (1)(ii) of Exhibit 1, any qualifications as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect included in such representation and
warranty (including, for avoidance of doubt, the qualifications as to
Material Adverse Effect in Section 5.1 of this Agreement) shall be
disregarded for purposes of determining whether this condition has been
satisfied;

a specified increase or decrease in a market index), (b) a declaration of a
banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the
