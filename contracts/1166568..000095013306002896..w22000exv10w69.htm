During the period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Seller will give prompt written notice to the Buyer if Seller becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of the Sellers representations and warranties as of the date of this Agreement, or if Seller becomes aware of the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact or condition that would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty as of the Closing Date. Should any such fact or condition require any change in the Disclosure Schedules if the Disclosure Schedules were dated the date of the occurrence or discovery of any such fact or condition, the Seller may deliver to the Buyer a proposed supplement to the Disclosure Schedules (the " _Supplement_ ") specifying such change. The rights and obligations of the Buyer and the Seller with respect to any Supplement will be as follows:

 (b) if the matters disclosed in the Supplement, individually or in the aggregate with all matters disclosed in prior Supplements, would result in the failure of the condition set forth in  _Section 9.1(a)_ to be satisfied, the Buyer will have five (5) Business days following its receipt of such Supplement to (i) accept and be bound by the matters set forth in such Supplement, as though the matters disclosed therein had been included in the Disclosure Schedules as originally delivered by the Sellers, or (ii) at the Buyers option, terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Seller given during such five (5) Business day period, provided that if Buyer does not so terminate this Agreement during such five (5) Business day period, Buyer and Parent will be deemed to have accepted and shall be bound by the matters set forth in such Supplement as set forth in (i) herein; and 

  

 (c) for purposes of determining whether the Seller has breached its representations and warranties, matters set forth in any Supplement will have the same status as other matters set forth in the Disclosure Schedules, and if the Buyer and Parent consummate the transactions contemplated hereby after receiving such Supplement neither the Buyer, nor Parent nor any other 

   ##### 

  

    

Buyer Indemnified Parties will be entitled to indemnification for any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty that was the subject of such

 _Section 7.2 Post-Closing Consents; Assignability. _Other than with respect to Government Contracts which shall be governed solely by _Section 7.3_: 

  

 (a) The Seller and the Buyer each will use commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing Date to obtain all consents, approvals or authorizations of any third parties that are not required to be obtained or were waived by the Buyer prior to the Closing Date and that are required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that neither the Seller nor the Buyer will be required to make any expenditures or incur any liability in connection with such activities. 

  

 (b) Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 7.2_, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Article II_, to the extent that any Purchased Contract or Permit (collectively, the " _Assigned Instruments_ ") is not capable of being transferred by the Seller to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement without the consent of a third party, and such consent is not obtained prior to Closing, or if such transfer or attempted transfer would constitute a breach or a violation of the Assigned Instrument or any Law (each a " _Specified Consent_ "), nothing in this Agreement will constitute a transfer or an attempted transfer thereof. 

  

 (c) In the event that any such Specified Consent is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, or if any attempted assignment would be ineffective, the Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts, and the Buyer will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the 

   ##### 

  

    

Seller, (i) to obtain all consents, novations and waivers and to resolve all
impracticalities of assignment, novation or transfer necessary to convey the

the Buyer and for the account of the Buyer, any rights of the Seller arising
from any such Assigned Instrument. 

  

 (d) To the extent that the Buyer is provided the benefits of any Assigned Instrument referred to in _Section 7.2(c)_, the Buyer will perform or discharge the obligations arising under such Assigned Instrument for the benefit of the Seller and the other party or parties thereto, except for any obligation under such Assigned Instrument that constitutes an Excluded Liability. 

  

 (e) Once a Specified Consent is obtained, (i) the applicable Assigned Instrument will be deemed to have been automatically transferred to the Buyer on the terms set forth in this Agreement, (ii) the obligations arising out of the use, performance, ownership or operation of the applicable Assigned Instrument after the Closing will be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities, and (iii) the rights pursuant to the applicable Assigned Instrument will be deemed to be a Purchased Asset.

The Parent, the Seller and the Buyer will each use commercially reasonable efforts to provide all reasonable information and take all other actions reasonably necessary to execute and consummate such Novation Agreement. 

  

 (b) In the event that the U.S. Government declines to enter into a Novation Agreement in accordance with, and to the extent required by, Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 42, Subpart 42.12 recognizing the transfer of the Government Prime Contracts to the Parent, or until such time as the U.S. Government recognizes such transfer by entering into a Novation Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will constitute a transfer, assignment, attempted transfer or an attempted assignment thereof. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Effective upon the Closing and until such time as the U.S. Government recognizes the transfer of the rights and obligations under a Government Prime Contract to the Buyer, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 42, Subpart 42.12, and until such time as the effective date of the assignment of any Government Subcontract requiring assignment, the Seller and the Parent shall enter into the Subcontract Agreement with respect to such Government Contracts in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Subcontract_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, the economic and other benefits of the Government Contracts shall be vested in the Parent prior to novation or assignment thereof. Each of the Parent and the Buyer further agrees that in connection with its activities pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and the Subcontract, it will comply with any existing agreements or arrangements with the U.S. Government with respect to the avoidance, resolution, or mitigation of "Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest," as that term is used in Subpart 9.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 C.F.R. Sec. 9.500 _et seq_.), and that each will enter into and comply with such future agreements or arrangements as the U.S. Government may reasonably determine are necessary or appropriate under that subpart. In the event that the U.S. Government affirmatively declines to novate any Government Prime Contract, the Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide to the Parent, at the Parents expense, the benefits of the applicable Government Prime Contract through the Subcontract; (ii) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to the Parent, and (iii) enforce at the request and expense of the Parent and for the account of the Parent, any rights of the Seller arising from any such Government Contract; provided that the Seller will not be required to make any expenditures or incur any liability or take any actions or refrain from taking any actions that would conflict with any existing agreements or arrangements with the U.S. Government with respect to the avoidance, resolution, or mitigation of "Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interests," as that term is used in Subpart 9.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 C.F.R. Sec. 9.500 _et seq_.), in connection with any such activities described in clauses (i) through (iv) above. 

  

 _Section 7.4 Litigation Support. _In the event and for so long as either Party is actively contesting or defending against any third party or Governmental Entity charge, audit, complaint, action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, claim or demand in connection with any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act or transaction involving the Purchased Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or the Excluded Liabilities, the other Party will cooperate with the contesting or defending Party and its counsel in the contest or defense, make available its personnel at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice and provide such testimony and access to its books and records as may be reasonably requested in connection with the contest or defense, at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless such contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Article X_ in which case, the costs and expense will be borne by the Parties as set forth in _Article X_). 

  

 _Section 7.5 Pro-rations. _The Parties agree that any Apportioned Obligations, and any refund, rebate or similar payment received by the Seller or by the Buyer for any Taxes that are Apportioned Obligations, will be apportioned between the Seller and the Buyer as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) For Apportioned Obligations based upon or related to income or receipts, the Seller agrees to indemnify the Buyer for the amount of such Apportioned Obligations that would be payable if the relevant year or period ended on the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) For Apportioned Obligations measured by the amount or level of any item (including, but not limited to, such Apportioned Obligations as are measured by the amount of capital or the value of intangibles) the Seller agrees to indemnify the Buyer for the amount of such Apportioned Obligations that are determined by multiplying (A) the amount or level of such items immediately prior to the Closing, by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. 

  

 (c) For Apportioned Obligations consisting of unapplied cash security deposits, Buyer shall pay to Seller at Closing the amount of such unapplied cash security deposits and Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any amounts applied by any lessor under the Real Property Leases with respect to any event occurring prior to the Closing. 

  

 (d) For all Apportioned Obligations not described in (a) or (b), the Seller agrees to indemnify the Buyer for the amount of such Apportioned Obligations that are determined by multiplying (A) the amount of such Apportioned Obligations for the entire Straddle Period, by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. 

 

The Seller will pay Apportioned Obligations that are due and payable on or
prior to the Closing Date, and bill the Buyer for any part of that amount
apportioned to the Buyer. The Buyer will pay Apportioned Obligations that are
due and payable after the Closing Date and bill the Seller for any part of
that amount apportioned to the Seller. Notwithstanding any other
provision contained in this Agreement (including the limitations set forth in
_Sections 10.2_ or  _10.3_ ), any obligation arising out of this _Section
7.5_ will not be considered a Loss, subject to any limits of minimum or
maximum amounts, measurement of aggregate amount of Losses or any limit of
time.

 (b) The Parties will provide each other with such assistance and information relating to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as may reasonably be requested in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or the performance of any audit, examination or any other proceeding by any Taxing Authority, whether conducted in a judicial or administrative forum, and will each retain and provide to the other Party all records and other information which may be relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, examination or any other proceeding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Parties will retain, for 

   ##### 

  

    

six years after the Closing, copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work
schedules and other records relating to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities for taxable periods, or ratable portions of any taxable periods,
ending prior to or including the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) The Seller will exercise exclusive control over the handling, disposition and settlement of any inquiry, examination, or proceeding by a Governmental Entity that could result in a determination with respect to Taxes due or payable by the Buyer or the Parent for which the Seller or its Affiliates may be liable or against which the Seller may be required to indemnify the Buyer or the Parent. The Buyer and the Parent will notify the Seller in writing promptly upon learning of any such inquiry, examination or proceeding. The Buyer and the Parent will cooperate with the Seller, as the Seller may reasonably request, in any such inquiry, examination or proceeding. Neither the Buyer nor the Parent will extend the statute of limitations for any Tax for which the Seller may be required to indemnify the Buyer or the Parent without the Sellers prior written consent. 

  

 (d) If the Buyer or Parent receives a refund with respect to Taxes for which the Seller is wholly or partially responsible under _Section 2.3(b)(iii)_ hereof, the Buyer will pay, within 30 days following the receipt of such Tax refund, the amount of such Tax refund attributable to the Seller. If the Seller receives a refund with respect to Taxes for which the Buyer or Parent is wholly or partially responsible under _Section 2.3(a)(iv)_ hereof, Seller will pay, within 30 days following the receipt of such Tax refund, the amount of such Tax refund attributable to the Buyer or Parent. 

  

 (e) Neither Party will agree to settle any Tax liability or compromise any claim with respect to Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, which settlement or compromise may affect the liability for Taxes hereunder (or right to Tax benefit) of the other Party, without the other Partys consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (f) The Buyer will pay all Taxes that are required to be paid with respect to any transfer, sales, use, gross receipts, recording, value-added or similar Taxes that may be imposed by reason of the sale, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Purchased Assets. The Buyer will timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed in connection with the payment of such Taxes and will be responsible for any penalties and interest related to any late or erroneous filing. 

  

 _Section 7.7 Records and Documents. _Without limiting the effect of _Section 7.6(a)_, the Parties will preserve and keep all books and records relating to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities for a period of six years following the Closing Date. After such six-year period, a Party will provide at least 60 days prior written notice to the other Party of its intent to dispose of any such books and records, and such other Party will be given the opportunity, at its cost and expense, to remove and retain all or any part of such books and records as it may select. During such six-year period, duly authorized representatives of a Party will, upon reasonable notice, have reasonable access during normal business hours to examine, inspect and copy such books and records held by the other Party. 

  

 _Section 7.8 Use of Excluded Names. _Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section 7.8_ and the Subcontract Agreement, no interest in or right to use the Excluded Names is 

   ##### 

  

    

being assigned, transferred or otherwise conveyed to the Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement. Except as expressly permitted pursuant to the Subcontract
Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the Closing, but in no event
later than 30 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer and Parent will
stop using the Excluded Names in any form including by removing, permanently
obliterating or covering all Excluded Names that appear on any Purchased
Asset or Assumed Liability, including all signs, promotional or advertising
literature, labels, stationery, business cards, office forms and packaging
materials. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event will the Buyer nor
Parent use or display any Excluded Name in any way (i) other than in the same
manner used by the Seller in connection with the Purchased Assets immediately
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) in connection with services not conforming to
the same standard of quality that existed prior to the Closing Date, or (iii)
that could detract from or impair the goodwill associated with such Excluded
Names. Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will use any Excluded
Name, trademark, service mark, brand name, certification mark, trade name,
corporate name, domain name or other indication of source or origin that is
likely to cause confusion with any of the Excluded Names or be associated with
the Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date, except as
expressly permitted pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ and the Subcontract
Agreement. 

  

 _Section 7.9 Non-Solicitation. _For a period commencing on the Closing Date and terminating one year after the Closing Date, neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, solicit (or assist or encourage any other Person to solicit) or otherwise interfere with the Buyers employment relationship with any Acquired Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section 7.9_ will not prohibit the solicitation nor hiring of an individual solely pursuant to a general public advertisement or other such general solicitation of employment. 

  

 _Section 7.10 Certain Payments._ 

   

 (a) Seller will invoice and bill all third parties (i) prior to or as soon as reasonably practical following the Closing Date for any and all accounts, claims, liabilities or obligations referenced in _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_, provided that any such amounts which remain unbilled pursuant to a Government Contract pending the U.S. Government Approval of final indirect rates, and/or any incurred cost audits by Governmental Entities for the years ended 2004, 2005 or 2006, need not be billed or credited until a reasonable period of time following the final resolution of such matters, and (ii) within a reasonable time after being advised in writing by Buyer that the At-Risk Amounts may be billed. Any amounts collected and/or payments received in connection with the foregoing will be an Excluded Asset pursuant to _Section 2.3_ of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Buyer and Parent will cooperate with Sellers efforts to bill and collect the amounts as set forth in this section, including by (i) promptly advising Seller in writing of any developments concerning the matters set forth above or otherwise contemplated by this Agreement that are reasonably related to the billing and collection of the foregoing, and (ii) providing Seller and its representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours and under reasonable circumstances to all personnel, premises and properties, assets, books, records and documents related to the foregoing, including furnishing Seller and its representatives with related financial and other information in Buyers or Parents possession as the Seller may from time to time reasonable request. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 7.11 Post-Closing Receipts_. If after the Closing Date any Party receives any funds properly belonging to another Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the receiving Party will promptly advise the other Party, will segregate and hold such funds in trust for the benefit of such other Party and will promptly deliver such funds, together with any interest earned thereon, to an account or accounts designated in writing by such other Party. 

  

 _Section 7.12 Certain Novations and Consents_. Except as set forth in _Section 7.3_ and  _7.13_ , the Buyer agrees that the Seller will not have any liability whatsoever to the Buyer as a result of the failure to obtain any Novation Agreement consents that may have been or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default, acceleration or termination of any Assigned Instrument or Government Contract as a result thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, other than _Section 7.3_ and _7.13_ , the Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Seller contained herein will be breached or deemed breached, and no condition of the Buyer, except as set forth in _Section 9.1(h)_, will be deemed not to be satisfied, directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure to obtain any such consent. 

  

 _Section 7.13 Identified Programs_. Parent, Buyer and Seller agree that the matters referenced on _Schedule 7.13 _with respect to the Option Programs and Consent Programs (as such terms are defined in _Schedule 7.13_), will be treated in the manner referenced on such schedule. 

  

 _Section 7.14 Lien Release_. Promptly following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Payoff Letter and have released the Liens (other than Permitted Encumbrances) on the Purchased Assets that are referenced in sections 1 and 2 of _Schedule 4.8(a)_. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 EMPLOYEE MATTERS 

   

 _Section 8.1 Employment. _The Buyer will offer to employ, commencing as of the Closing Date, each individual employed by the Seller in connection with the Purchased Assets immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Employees_ "), in a comparable position with the Buyer as provided by the Seller as of the Closing Date and assigned to the same Purchased Contract as such Employee was assigned immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Buyers offer of employment will be made at a time reasonably prior to the Closing Date and in a format reasonably acceptable to Seller. Neither Buyer nor Parent will communicate any terms of employment to Employees without Sellers prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Employees who accept the Buyers offer of employment and commence employment as of the Closing Date will be collectively referred to as the " _Acquired Employees_." For purposes of this _Section 8.1_, any Employee on short-term disability, vacation or leave of absence with a definite date of return will be offered employment as set forth in this _Section 8.1_, but the Buyer is not required to offer to employ any Employee on long-term disability, layoff or on leave of absence with no prior agreement or understanding to return to employment with the Seller at the end of such disability, layoff or leave. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Employee to whom the Buyer does not offer employment pursuant to the preceding sentence returns to active work status within one year immediately following the Closing Date, the Buyer will offer such person employment as set forth in this _Section 8.1_. For a 

   ##### 

  

    

period ending no earlier than December 31, 2006, the Acquired Employees will
(a) receive the same or higher base salary or wage rate in effect as of the
Closing Date and the Buyer will provide, for the 2006 calendar year, the same
or higher incentive compensation and bonus opportunities to the Acquired
Employees as those in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (b) be
assigned to the same Purchased Contract as such Employees were
assigned immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will, after the Closing Date, impose on
the Buyer or Parent any obligation to retain any Acquired Employee in its
employment. Acquired Employees will be at-will employees who are
terminable at-will in the discretion of the Buyer. Nothing express or implied
in this Agreement will confer upon any of the employees of the Seller, the
Buyer, or any of their Affiliates, any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment, or continued employment for any specified period, of any
nature or kind whatsoever under or by any reason of this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 8.2 Employee Benefit Matters_. 

  

 (a) As of the Closing Date, the Acquired Employees will cease participation in all Seller Employee Benefit Plans. Effective as of the Closing Date and continuing for a period ending no earlier than December 31, 2006, the Buyer will provide to each of the Acquired Employees through Employee Benefit Plans provided by the Buyer to its employees (collectively, " _Buyer Employee Benefit Plans_ ") and fringe benefit programs (including, as applicable, sick pay, incentive compensation or bonus programs, vacation pay and tuition reimbursement programs), employee benefits which are substantially comparable to the employee benefits provided to each of such Acquired Employees under corresponding Seller Employee Benefit Plans and Seller fringe benefit programs as of the Closing Date, provided further that the Acquired Employees rights and entitlements under such Buyer Employee Benefit Plans and fringe benefit programs shall be effective as of the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, any SAFTAS Employees who become Acquired Employees will also be entitled to certain additional benefits as set forth on _Schedule 8.2(a)_. As of the Closing Date, each of the Acquired Employees will be entitled to all time accrued for accrued general leave and grandfathered sick leave or other leave accrued under leave policies of Seller as of the Closing Date, provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, no individual Acquired Employee will be entitled to more than two hundred hours of such accrued leave. 

  

 (b) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9 QandA-7, as of the Closing Date, the Buyer will assume all liability for providing and administering all required notices and benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (" _COBRA_ ") to all Acquired Employees for "qualifying events," as defined in Code Section 4980B, (" _Qualifying Events_ ") occurring after the Closing Date. The Seller will have no COBRA liability or obligations to such Acquired Employees for Qualifying Events occurring after the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) Effective as of the Closing Date and continuing for a period ending no earlier than December 31, 2006, the Buyer will provide each Acquired Employee with severance benefits that are substantially comparable to the severance benefits provided to each such Acquired Employee by the Seller as of the last day preceding the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, the Buyer will provide the Acquired Employees with incentive compensation payments as set forth on _Schedule 8.2(d)_, such amounts to be paid in accordance with regular payroll practices but no later than the first pay period in January, 2007. 

  

 (e) Solely for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the Buyer Employee Benefit Plans and Buyers fringe benefit programs in which Acquired Employees will participate as of the Closing Date and for purposes of calculating severance (but not for purposes of pension accruals), the Buyer will cause each Acquired Employee to be credited with his or her years of service with the Seller (and any of its Affiliates or any predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing Date, to the same extent as such Acquired Employee was entitled, as of the Closing Date, to credit for such service under any corresponding Seller Employee Benefit Plan or severance plan or policy of the Seller. 

  

 (f) To the extent the respective insurance carriers will permit on a commercially reasonable basis, the Buyer will (i) waive any pre-existing condition limitation under any Buyer Employee Benefit Plan that is an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan in which Acquired Employees and their eligible dependents participate as of and following the Closing Date (to the extent such waivers are consistent with Employee Welfare Benefit Plans of the Seller in which the Acquired Employee participated as of the date of this Agreement) and (ii) provide each Acquired Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the relevant portion of the plan year prior to the Closing Date in order to satisfy any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any corresponding Buyer Employee Benefit Plan that is an Employee Welfare Benefit Plans of the Buyer in which any of the Acquired Employees will participate as of and after the Closing Date. 

  

 (g) As of the Closing Date and subject to Revenue Ruling 2002-32, the Seller will cause the portion of its flexible reimbursement plan applicable to the Acquired Employees to be segregated into a separate component and all account balances and salary reduction elections of such Acquired Employees in the Sellers flexible reimbursement plan will be transferred to a flexible reimbursement plan that the Buyer will cause to be maintained for the duration of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs. 

  

 _Section 8.3 Defined Contribution Plans. _As of the Closing Date, with respect to any Seller Employee Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and is maintained by or for the benefit of any of the Acquired Employees, the Acquired Employees will cease to participate in such defined contribution plan. As of the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, each Employee will be one hundred percent (100%) vested in, and permitted to elect a distribution of his or her account balance in the Sellers defined contribution plans and will be permitted to roll over his or her account balance in the Sellers defined contribution plans (or any portion thereof) to a defined contribution plan of the Buyer. 

  

 _Section 8.4 Compliance with WARN. _With respect to the Employees, the Buyer will have full responsibility under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended (WARN) and any other similar statutes or regulations of any jurisdiction relating to any plant closing or mass layoff. For these purposes, a plant closing or a mass layoff will be 

   ##### 

  

    

deemed to have been caused by the Buyer if such plant closing or mass layoff
would not have occurred but for the Buyers failure to offer employment to
the Employees in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or the
Buyers failure to employ the Acquired Employees thereafter.

If any third party notifies the Indemnified Party with respect to any matter which may give rise to a Claim for indemnification (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against the Indemnifying Party under this _Article X_, then the Indemnified Party will notify the Indemnifying Party promptly thereof in writing and in any event within 15 days after receiving notice from a third party; provided that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless, and then solely to the extent that, the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. All notices given pursuant to this _Section 10.4_ will describe with reasonable specificity the Third Party Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Partys Claim for indemnification. Once the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent it chooses to do so, to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its choice; provided, however, the Indemnified Party may participate in (but not control) such defense, and after notice of its election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless the Indemnifying Party does not 

   ##### 

  

    

actually assume the defense thereof following notice of such election. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party will have the right to undertake the defense of such Third
Party Claim, by counsel or other representatives of its own choosing, on
behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party (subject to
the limitations on the Indemnifying Partys obligations to indemnify
otherwise set forth in this  _Article X_ and to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of or opposition to such Third Party
Claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final
determination thereof). 

  

 (b) Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim that might give rise to liability of the other Party under this _Article X_ without such Partys consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party elects to settle any such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party refuses to consent to such compromise or settlement, then the liability of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party will be limited to the amount offered by the Indemnifying Party in compromise or settlement. 

  

 _Section 10.5 Certain Limitations. _Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: 

  

 (a) AN INDEMNIFYING PARTY WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR ANY LOSSES OR CLAIMS (A) OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO A THIRD PARTY CLAIM, ARISING OUT OF ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR OTHER SPECIAL DAMAGES OR (B) ARISING OUT OF ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, GOODWILL, USE, INCOME, PROFITS OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS, BUSINESS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, SAVINGS, DATA, OR BUSINESS REPUTATION), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER THEORY, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF, KNEW OF, OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR (ii) CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY TO COMPLY WITH _SECTION 10.10_. 

  

 (b) The obligations of the Indemnifying Party to provide indemnification under this  _Article X_ will be terminated, modified or abated as appropriate to the extent that the underlying Claim (i) would not have arisen but for a voluntary act that is carried out at the express written request of, or with the express written approval, concurrence of or with the knowing assistance of the Indemnified Party, (ii) is based substantially on the negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Party, or (iii) relates to the inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement of which the Indemnified Party had actual knowledge prior to the Closing. 

  

 _Section 10.6 Certain Benefits. _The amount of any indemnification payable under this  _Article X_ will be net of (a) any tax benefits that the Indemnified Party receives or is entitled to receive by reason of the Claim giving rise to the indemnification payment, and (b) the receipt of any insurance proceeds paid or payable to the Indemnified Party under any policies of insurance 

   ##### 

  

    

covering the Loss giving rise to the Claim. The Indemnified Party will use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect any such insurance and will
account to the Indemnifying Party therefor. If, at any time subsequent to the
Indemnified Party receiving an indemnity payment for a Claim under this
_Article X_, the Indemnified Party receives payment in respect of the
Loss underlying such Claim through recovery, settlement or otherwise under or
pursuant to any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery,
settlement or payment by or against another Person (other than a payment with
respect to a tax benefit contemplated in clause (a) above), the amount of
such payment, less any costs, expenses or premiums incurred directly in
connection therewith, will promptly be repaid by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party. 

  

 _Section 10.7 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. _All indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement will be treated by the Parties as adjustments to the Purchase Price. 

  

 _Section 10.8 Exclusive Remedy. _Following the Closing, the remedies provided in this  _Article X_ and pursuant to _Section 7.13_ will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties for all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Document after the Closing, and no Party will be entitled to pursue, and each hereby expressly waives, any and all rights that may otherwise be available either at law or in equity against the other Party with respect to this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, including any claims for rescission. Notwithstanding the foregoing the Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. The Parties agree that, in the event of any breach by the other Party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the other Party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary damages) to seek (a) a decree or other specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach.

References to any document in the Disclosure Schedules do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the document itself. Inclusion of information in the Disclosure Schedules will not be construed as an admission that such information is material to the business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Purchased Assets. The specific disclosures set forth in the Disclosure Schedules have been organized to correspond to section references in this Agreement to which the disclosure may be most likely to relate, together with appropriate cross references when disclosure is applicable to other sections of this Agreement; provided, however, that any disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules will apply to and will be deemed to be disclosed for the purposes of this Agreement generally.

Subject to the preceding sentence and except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 _Section 12.6 Amendment; Waiver. _This Agreement may be amended by a written instrument executed and delivered by the Seller and the Buyer. At any time prior to the Closing, the Parties may extend the time for performance of or waive compliance with any of the covenants or agreements of the other Party to this Agreement, and may waive any breach of the representations or warranties of such other Party.

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 12.7 Severability. _Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 12.8 Counterparts. _This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same Agreement. 

  

 _Section 12.9 Descriptive Headings. _The descriptive headings of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and will not constitute a part of this Agreement.

 _Section 12.13 Governing Law. _THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY LAW OR RULE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO BE APPLIED. 

  

 _Section 12.14 Public Announcement_. Neither Party will issue any press release or public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of the other Party, provided that either Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by Law or any listing agreement concerning its publicly-traded securities, in which case the disclosing party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to advise the other Party prior to making such disclosure,

 _Section 5.2 Confidential Licensed IP._ 

  

       | (a)  |   | The Licensee shall: (i) hold the Confidential

used to protect its own confidential or proprietary information from
disclosure, and in no event less than a reasonable degree of care; (ii)
restrict disclosure of the Confidential Licensed IP solely to Persons with a
need to know and who agree not to disclose it to any other Person
except Persons with a need to know who are also bound to confidentiality
obligations; (iii) advise all Persons that receive Confidential Licensed IP

this License Agreement by the Licensee); (ii) was known by the Licensee prior
to being obtained from the Licensors, as evidenced by written records or
tangible embodiments thereof; (iii) has been disclosed to the Licensee by
another Person on a non-confidential basis where such other Person is
not bound by any confidentiality obligations or not otherwise legally
prohibited from disclosing such information; or (iv) was independently
developed by the Licensee without any Confidential Licensed IP.  
   

  

 _Section 5.3 Legally Required Disclosure. _Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may disclose the terms of this Agreement and the Licensee may disclose any Confidential 

   ##### 

  

    

Licensed IP as required by any court or other Governmental Entity or as
otherwise required by Law. In the event that a Party receives a request (oral
or written) to disclose all or any part of the foregoing in any legal
proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar
process, such Party shall (a) immediately notify the other Party of the
existence, terms, and circumstances surrounding such request; (b) cooperate
with the other Party, at the other Partys expense, with respect to taking
legally available steps to seek an appropriate protective order or other
remedy; and (c) in the event such protective order or other remedy is not
obtained, furnish only that portion of the License Agreement or Confidential
Licensed IP that, in the written opinion of the disclosing Partys counsel,
is legally required to be disclosed and to exercise best efforts to obtain an
order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to the License Agreement or Confidential Licensed IP. 

  

 _Section 5.4 Irreparable Harm. _The Licensee agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of _Section 5.1_ or _5.2_. Accordingly, in addition to the rights and remedies otherwise available to the Licensors, the Licensors will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief in the event of any actual or threatened breach of _Section 5.1_ or _5.2_ by the Licensee.

 _Section 6.2 Reservation of Rights. _Notwithstanding the fact that the license granted to Licensee hereunder is irrevocable, the Licensors hereby reserve all available rights and remedies it may have in law or in equity in the event of a breach of this License Agreement, including specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief (other than termination, revocation or cancellation of this License Agreement). The Licensee agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or other indemnity in connection with such a remedy. 

  

 _Section 6.3 Bankruptcy Code. _It is the express intent of the Parties that the licenses granted under this License Agreement are, and will otherwise be deemed to be, licenses of rights to intellectual property as set forth in Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code, and that all of the Licensed IP constitutes "intellectual property" under Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code.

EXHIBIT C 

   

SUBCONTRACT AGREEMENT  

  

 THIS SUBCONTRACT AGREEMENT (hereinafter referred to as the " _Agreement_ " or the " _Subcontract_ ") is made as of this ___th day of _ _, 2006, and constitutes the entire agreement between Anteon Corporation (hereafter " _Prime Contractor_ ") and Alion Science and Technology Corporation (hereafter " _Subcontractor_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS, Prime Contractor, Subcontractor, and Alion Technical Services Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Subcontractor have entered into an agreement dated _ _, 2006 (the " _Asset Purchase Agreement_ "), whereby Subcontractor has purchased the Government Contracts (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) and the assets used by Prime Contractor to perform the Government Contracts; 

  

 WHEREAS, Prime Contractor has entered into certain contracts with the United States Government (the " _Government_ ") as well as certain contracts with Non-Governmental Entities (" _NGEs_ "), including subcontracts in which Prime Contractor is the subcontractor, and teaming agreements, and currently has pending certain contract proposals that it has submitted to the Government, which contracts, subcontracts and proposals are identified and described in Schedules 1.1(b) and 1.1(c) to the Asset Purchase Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, Prime Contractor and Subcontractor will be submitting requests to: (a) the Government to novate the Government Prime Contracts (the " _Novation Requests_ "), and/or (b) to the appropriate non-governmental entity (an " _NGE_ "), as may be required pursuant to the terms of given Government Subcontracts, to seek the acceptance of the assignment to the Subcontractor of the applicable Government Subcontracts (the " _Consent Requests_ ") (each such Government Prime Contract or Government Subcontract requiring a Novation Request or Consent Request is referred to herein as a " _Consent Contract_ ", and collectively, the " _Consent Contracts_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Government or NGE, as applicable, may wish to modify or extend any of the Consent Contracts, or issue new task orders or deliver orders under any such Consent Contract, in order to add additional work to such Consent Contract (" _Additional Work_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to arrange for the continued performance of the Consent Contracts in accordance with all of their respective requirements and terms until such time as the Government consents to the Novation Request or an NGE consents to the Consent Request. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I  SCOPE OF WORK 

   

 1\. _Incorporation of Government Contracts: Definitions_. The Consent Contracts are incorporated by reference herein. To give effect to the provisions contained 

   ##### 

  

 

therein, with respect to the Government Prime Contracts once made a part of
this Agreement, any reference to the " _Government_ " or the " _Contracting
Officer_ " shall mean Prime Contractor, unless such reference by its terms is
applicable only to the Government, and any reference to the " _Contractor_ "
shall mean Subcontractor and with respect to the Government Subcontracts with
an NGE, once made a part of this Agreement, any references to the NGE shall
mean Prime Contractor, unless such reference by its terms is applicable only
to the NGE, and any reference to Prime Contractor or the " _Contractor_ "
shall mean Subcontractor. All terms not otherwise defined herein shall have
the same meaning as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. 

   

 2. _Prime Contractor Responsibility_. Prime Contractor shall retain its legal obligations as a prime contractor in accordance with the Consent Contracts and shall not take any action that interferes with Subcontractors performance under the Consent Contracts. Prime Contractor shall provide assistance as reasonably necessary for Subcontractor to perform under the Consent Contracts. Prime Contractor agrees to pass on any and all orders or requests for work issued by the Government or an NGE under the Consent Contracts to Subcontractor after the Closing Date. 

  

 3. _Subcontractor Responsibility_. Subcontractor shall diligently perform all requirements, and furnish to the Government or NGE all services and materials necessary to complete performance of the obligations, of each Consent Contract in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, unless Prime Contractor indicates otherwise by notice to Subcontractor or applicable law requires otherwise, Subcontractor shall be considered Prime Contractors agent for purposes of (a) collecting all amounts that may be due from the other party or parties to each Consent Contract and that relate to the period of subcontract performance hereunder with respect to such Consent Contract; and (b) negotiating or otherwise handling all disputes and issues that may arise in connection with each Consent Contract and that relate to the period of subcontract performance hereunder with respect to such Consent Contract. 

  

ARTICLE II  RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES 

   

 1. _Cooperation_. Both parties shall fully cooperate with each other to ensure that all requirements of the Consent Contracts and Additional Work, if applicable, are satisfied and that the transition of performance occurs without disruption or inconvenience to the Government or NGE. 

  

 2. _Communications with Government or NGE_. Subcontractor shall, in the first instance, be responsible for communications with the Government or NGE, as applicable, regarding the Consent Contracts. Subcontractor shall promptly inform Prime Contractor of the substance of any such communications that are material. Prime Contractor will include Subcontractor (or update Subcontractor) with respect to any material communications with the Government or NGE, as applicable, regarding the Consent Contracts. Prime Contractor shall forward any written communications from the Government or NGE, as applicable, referring to or relating to the Consent Contracts to Subcontractor to be received not more than five business days from receipt by Prime Contractor. 

   ##### 

  

  

 3. _Disclosure_. The parties hereby agree that the contents of this Subcontract may be made known to the Government or any NGE. 

  

 4. _Award of Additional Work_. If at any time prior to the expiration, termination, assignment, or novation of a Consent Contract, Subcontractor requests Prime Contractor (a) to seek an extension or modification of the Consent Contract and/or (b) to submit a proposal or compete for a new task order or delivery order under the Consent Contract, Prime Contractor shall make reasonable efforts (y) to request and obtain such an extension or modification, and/or (z) to obtain award of additional work, such as a task order or delivery order. Prime Contractors obligation under the immediately preceding sentence is subject to the parties express understanding that Subcontractor shall, in the first instance, be responsible for the preparation of any request for extension or modification and of any task order or delivery order proposal and for the conduct of discussions or negotiations with the Government or NGE, as applicable, with respect to such request or proposal. Subcontractor shall reimburse Prime Contractor for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and pay to Prime Contractor reasonable labor and expenses incurred by Prime Contractor, in connection with its efforts to request and obtain such Additional Work (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees). __  

  

 5. _Billing Agency Authorization_. (a) Prime Contractor hereby appoints and authorizes Subcontractor, its employees and designees, as its exclusive agent for the purpose of submitting invoices in Prime Contractors name to the Government seeking any and all payments under the Consent Contracts. 

  

 (b) Prime Contractor specifically authorizes Subcontractor to submit invoices to the Government consistent with the pricing and other requirements set forth in the Consent Contracts. Prime Contractor shall pass on to Subcontractor, without any withholding or setoff, via wire transfer within five business days any amounts paid by, and received from, the Government or an NGE for performance by Subcontractor of its obligations under the Consent Contracts as incorporated herein. 

   

 (c) In the absence of Subcontractors failure to perform its duties or responsibilities under this Article, Prime Contractor agrees to refrain from undertaking any actions which Subcontractor is authorized to undertake by this Article unless requested to do so by Subcontractor. Prime Contractor also agrees to refrain from retaining another agent to perform any of the actions covered in this Article, thereby making Subcontractor its exclusive agent for the purposes set forth herein. 

   

 (d) Subcontractor shall maintain true and correct books and records pertaining to such invoiced amounts and, upon reasonable notice, shall permit an independent entity hired by Prime Contractor, at Prime Contractors own expense, to audit sufficiently such books and records to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of all charges. 

   

 (e) For purposes of fulfilling its obligations as an agent of Prime Contractor, Subcontractor is expressly permitted by Prime Contractor to continue using the Excluded Names set forth in Article 7.8 of the Asset Purchase Agreement for a period of time extending more than 30 days after the Closing Date. 

    ##### 

  

     

ARTICLE III  ASSIGNMENT, TERM AND TERMINATION 

   

 1. _Assignment of Consent Contract_. Once a contract novation or consent to the assignment of a Consent Contract is obtained, (i) such Consent Contract will be deemed to have automatically transferred and assigned to Subcontractor on the terms set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, (ii) the obligations arising out of the use, performance, ownership or operation of such Consent Contract after the Closing will be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities under the Asset Purchase Agreement, and (iii) the rights pursuant to such Consent Contract will be deemed to be a Purchased Asset under the Asset Purchase Agreement. 

  

 2. _Term_. The term of this Agreement shall be from the Closing Date until the earlier of (x) such time as all of the Consent Contracts, including any extensions or options thereto exercised by the Government or NGE, are novated or assigned to Subcontractor as set forth immediately above, completed or terminated or (y) such time this Agreement is terminated upon mutual agreement by the parties as evidenced in writing. With respect to each Consent Contract, the responsibilities of the parties hereunder shall begin upon the Closing Date for each Consent Contract then in effect and shall cease upon the earlier of: (i) contract novation or assignment of such Consent Contract as set forth immediately above; (ii) completion or termination of such Consent Contract, including any renewals or options thereto exercised by the Government or NGE; (iii) receipt of a written determination by the Government or NGE that the Consent Contract may not be subcontracted to the Subcontractor; or (iv) termination of this Agreement. 

  

 3. _Termination_. In the event that any one of the Consent Contracts is terminated in whole or in part by the Government or NGE prior to contract novation or assignment and prior to expiration of the term of this Agreement, the rights of the parties concerning the termination shall be governed by the provisions of the applicable termination clause (such as the termination for convenience provisions or the termination for default provisions, as applicable) set forth in such Consent Contract, except that Subcontractors rights under such clause shall relate only to the period of subcontract performance hereunder for such Consent Contract. Prime Contractor may terminate Subcontractors work under any Consent Contract if, and only if such Consent Contract is terminated by the Government or NGE. 

  

 4. _Government Proposals_. The terms of this Agreement shall also apply to any Government Contract awarded to Prime Contractor as a result of a pending bid or proposal that by its terms requires novation or the consent of an NGE to assign (hereafter an " _Awarded Contract_ ") described on Schedule 1.1(b) or Schedule 1.1(c) of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The effective date of this Subcontract with respect to each such Awarded Contract shall be the date on which such Awarded Contract is awarded to Prime Contractor. For purposes of this Agreement, the parties rights, duties and obligations with respect to each such Awarded Contract are the same as set forth in this Agreement for Consent Contracts. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE IV  INDEMNITY AND 
 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS 

   

 1. _General Indemnity_. Prime Contractor agrees to indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless Subcontractor from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, expenses, damages, costs or other charges, including the costs and expenses and reasonable attorneys fees arising out of Prime Contractors performance or failure to perform with respect to any of its obligations under this Agreement, or any of its obligations under the Consent Contracts prior to the Closing Date. Subcontractor agrees to indemnify, defend save and hold harmless Prime Contractor from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, expenses, damages, costs or other charges, including the costs and expenses and reasonable attorneys fees arising out of Subcontractors performance or failure to perform with respect to any of its obligations under this Agreement or any of its obligations under the Consent Contracts on or after the Closing Date (including, without limitation, acts or omissions of Subcontractor or Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to adversely impact the novation or assignment of any Consent Contract). This provision shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. 

  

 2. _Compliance With Applicable Laws_. Prime Contractor agrees to indemnify and defend Subcontractor from any allegation of violation or actual violation of any Government Prime Contract or legal requirement imposed by a Government Prime Contract caused by the actions of Prime Contractor, Prime Contractors employees, consultants or subcontractors of any Government Prime Contract arising out of Prime Contractors performance or failure to perform with respect to any of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the Consent Contracts. Subcontractor agrees to indemnify and defend Prime Contractor from (i) any allegation of violation or actual violation of law by Subcontractor or its employees, consultants or subcontractors arising out of Subcontractors performance or failure to perform with respect to any of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the Consent Contracts or (ii) any violation or alleged violation of any legal requirement imposed by, or relating to, a Consent Contract. This provision shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. 

  

 3. _Legal Requirements_. The parties agree to take necessary precautions to assure compliance with all legal requirements pertaining to the Consent Contracts. 

  

ARTICLE V  CONFIDENTIALITY 

   

 1. _Confidential Information_. Confidential information marked as such, or known to the receiving party to be confidential and proprietary to the disclosing party (hereinafter referred to as " _Confidential Information_ "), will not be disclosed to a third party, except as authorized by the disclosing party. The receiving party is authorized to use Confidential Information in furtherance of the objectives of the Subcontract and in the performance and administration of the Consent Contracts, if applicable, and is granted any necessary license or permission by the disclosing party to do so. Disclosure of Confidential Information to third parties is authorized solely to the extent that such information is known or available to the trade or to the public or to the receiving party, without restriction, at the time of disclosure or becomes publicly available through no action of the receiving party. It is agreed that each of the parties hereto will protect and 

   ##### 

  

    

restrict access to Confidential Information with the same diligence as if it
were its own provided that such diligence is reasonable. 

  

 With respect to Confidential Information that will be disclosed or delivered to the Government, if the Confidential Information was marked with a restrictive notice by the originating party, the disclosing party will retain the restrictive notice, or will substitute the notice prescribed by the Government for such purposes, provided that the Consent Contracts, if applicable, authorize use of such a notice. If either party is notified that the Government proposes to disclose any such Confidential Information to a third party or is considering doing so, it will notify the other party. If Prime Contractor receives such notice regarding Confidential Information of Subcontractor, Prime Contractor agrees to cooperate in either authorizing or contesting such disclosure. 

   

 In the event of an authorized disclosure by a party to a third party other than the Government, any restrictive notice will be retained on any information so disclosed. 

   

 Upon termination or expiration of this Subcontract and completion of all deliverable requirements contained in this Subcontract as of the date of termination or expiration, the parties agree to return all Confidential Information and copies thereof in their possession to the disclosing party or destroy all such Confidential Information and copies and certify to the disclosing party (with such certificate being signed by an appropriate officer) that such destruction has occurred. 

   

 As between Subcontractor and Prime Contractor, the foregoing provisions as to the disclosure and use of Confidential Information shall expire five (5) years from the date such information is received by the receiving party. 

   

 2. _Survival_. The provisions of this Article V shall survive termination or expiration of this Subcontract. 

  

ARTICLE VI  DISPUTES 

   

 1. _Resolution of Disputes_. For the purposes of this Subcontract, the terms "claim," "certification" or "certify," and "dispute" shall have the meaning of the same terms as used in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. §§ 601-613), FAR Subpart 33.2, and FAR 52.233-1, "Disputes (DEC 1991)." All disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved under this Article VI. 

  

 2. _Procedure_. Subject to Article I, Section 3, with respect to any claim made by Subcontractor for which the Government is or may be liable, Subcontractor agrees that it will prepare its claim and will present it to Prime Contractor for submission to the Government under the Contract Disputes Act. Prime Contractor agrees to submit any such claim to the Government, at the expense of Subcontractor and subject to Prime Contractors determination, in its reasonable discretion, as to the merit of such claim. Prime Contractor shall promptly pay to Subcontractor any amount determined on appeal under the applicable Prime Contract, to the extent such payment relates to the period of Subcontract performance by Subcontractor. Subcontractor shall have the sole authority 

   ##### 

  

    

to direct the prosecution of the claim. In the event of a denial of a claim by
the Contracting Officer, Prime Contractor shall, at the direction and expense
of Subcontractor, either appeal or file suit pursuant to the Contract
Disputes Act and implementing regulations, or permit Subcontractor to proceed
in Prime Contractors name. The parties will be bound by the results of that
process. 

  

 To the extent that a claim or dispute between Prime Contractor and Subcontractor does not arise from the action or inaction of the Government, but rather solely from the action or inaction of a party to this Agreement, then it shall be resolved as follows. The Parties shall use their best efforts to settle the dispute, claim, question or disagreement. To this effect, Prime Contractor and Subcontractor shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both Parties. If they do not reach such solution within a period of 30 days, then, upon notice by either Party to the other, all disputes, claims, questions or disagreements shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The number of arbitrators shall be one.

FORM OF RETENTION AGREEMENT  

  

ANTEON CORPORATION  

  

June [ ], 2006  

  

[Name] 
 [Title] 
 [Address]  

  

Dear _ _: 

   

 As you know, Anteon Corporation ("Anteon") intends to sell to a third party (the "Buyer" or the "Company") a portfolio of contracts under which Anteon provides a range of Program Management and Engineering Services to certain customers (hereinafter the "Business"). Your contributions to the success of the Business and your active involvement during the transition period subsequent to such a Sale are important to Anteon and to the Buyer. Therefore, on behalf of Anteon, I am pleased to offer you this retention agreement (the "Agreement"), which will provide financial incentives for you to remain employed by the Buyer following the completion of the Sale. 

   

 The terms of this Agreement, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of which shall only become effective as of the Effective Date (as defined herein), are as follows: 

   

 Retention Incentive Payment. On the Effective Date (as defined herein), you will be eligible for a retention incentive payment in the amount of _ _ dollars ($ _ _) (the "Retention Incentive Payment"), subject to the following terms and conditions. The Retention Incentive Payment shall be paid to you by the Buyer on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the closing date of the Sale. However, you are not eligible to receive the Retention Incentive Payment if (a) the Sale does not occur, (b) you are no longer employed by the Buyer at the time any such payment is due to be paid because of your voluntary termination, resignation, death, disability or termination by the Buyer for "Cause," or (c) the Buyer of the Business requires, as a condition of the Sale, an employment agreement with you (which agreement contains no adverse change in your salary or incentive compensation) and you have not entered into such employment agreement with such Buyer as of the closing date of the Sale, except for such ancillary non-employment agreements of the Company providing for the protection and assignment of intellectual property executed by all of the Buyers employees. If your employment is terminated by the Buyer without Cause prior to the date that the payment is due, you shall be entitled to receive the Retention Incentive Payment. If an Effective Date does not occur within 6 months following the date first written above, this Agreement shall automatically terminate as of such date. 

    ##### 

  

     

 For the purpose of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean any of the following: (A) the commission by you of any act constituting financial dishonesty against the Company; (B) your engagement in any act of dishonesty, fraud, intentional misrepresentations, moral turpitude or illegality which, as determined by the Company: (aa) adversely affects the business or the reputation of the Buyer with its current or prospective customers, suppliers, lenders and/or other third parties with whom it does or might do business; or (bb) exposes the Company to a risk of civil or criminal legal damages, liabilities or penalties; (C) any material misconduct, material violation by you of the Companys policies, or non-performance of any material duty by you in connection with the business affairs of the Company; or (D) any material breach by you of this Agreement. 

   

 2\. Covenants. In consideration for the payment and agreements described in this Agreement, you agree to the following: 

  

 (a) _Confidentiality of Transaction Information_. You will not disclose to any party information related specifically to the Sale transaction including its existence, price, parties, arrangements, schedules and all related information pertinent to the solicitation, presentation, and closure of the Sale of the Business. 

   

 (b) _Return of Property; Intellectual Property Rights_ _._ On or before your termination of employment for any reason, you will return all property owned by the Company including files, documents, data and records (whether on paper, tapes, disks, or in any other form, electronic or otherwise), office equipment, credit cards, and employee identification cards. You acknowledge that the Company is the rightful owner of any programs, ideas, inventions, discoveries, copyright material, or trademarks that you may have originated or developed, or assisted in originating or developing, during your period of employment with the Company, where any such origination or development involved the use of company time or resources, or the exercise of your responsibilities for or on behalf of the Company. You will at all times, both before and after termination of employment, cooperate with the Company (at the Companys expense) in executing and delivering documents and taking any other actions that are necessary or requested by the Company to assist the Company in patenting, copyrighting, or registering any programs, ideas, inventions, discoveries, copyright material, or trademarks, and to vest title thereto in the Company. 

    

 (c) _Proprietary and Confidential Information_ _._ You will at all times preserve the confidentiality of all proprietary information and trade secrets of the Company, except to the extent that disclosure of such information is legally required. The phrase "proprietary information" means information that has not been lawfully disclosed to the public and that is treated as confidential within the business of the Company. 

   

 (d) _Interference with Employees and Customers_ _._ During the period of your employment with the Company and for a period ending twelve (12) months following the termination of your employment for any reason from the Company, you, except with the written consent of the Company, will not, directly or indirectly, (i) recruit or solicit any employee of the Company or 

   ##### 

  

    

the Companys affiliates (collectively "Covered Employee") for employment or
for retention as a consultant or service provider; (ii) hire or participate
(with another company or third party) in the process of hiring any person who
is then, or who within the preceding six (6) months was a Covered Employee,
or provide names or other information about the Companys employees to any
person or business under circumstances which could lead to the use of that
information for purposes of recruiting or hiring; (iii) solicit or induce, or
in any manner attempt to solicit or induce, any client or customer under
contract with the Company or its affiliates or any prospective client or
customer to which the Company or its affiliates has made a proposal at that
time (1) to cease being a customer of or to not become a customer of the
Company or its affiliates, or (2) to divert any business of such customer
from the Company or its affiliates; or (iv) otherwise interfere
with, disrupt, or attempt to interfere with or disrupt, the contractual
relationship between the Company or its affiliates, and any of their
customers or clients, suppliers, consultants, or employees. 

   

 (e) _Waiver_. Nothing in this Agreement will bar you from requesting, at the time of your termination of employment or at any time thereafter, that the Company, in its sole discretion, waive in writing the Companys rights to enforce some or all of this paragraph 2 ("Covenants"). 

   

 (f) _Other Agreements and Policies_ _._ The obligations imposed on you by this paragraph 2 ("Covenants") are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any and all other policies or agreements of the Company. 

   

 (g) _Violation of Covenants_. In the event that you violate any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, including those set forth in paragraph 2, upon written notice and demand from the Company, you shall forfeit and pay over to the Company the total amount of any Retention Incentive Payment paid to you prior to the date of such notice. 

  

 3. Assignment. Anteon intends to assign all of its rights and delegate all of its obligations under this Agreement to the Buyer of the Business concurrently with the completion of the Sale and such Buyer shall agree to assume all the obligations of Anteon hereunder. You hereby consent, without the requirement of further notice, to any such assignment, delegation and assumption. You may not assign your rights and obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 4. Binding Effect. This Agreement and all your rights hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by your personal and legal representatives, executors and successors. This Agreement and all of Anteons and the Companys rights hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Companys successors and assigns. 

  

 5. Taxes. The Company may withhold from any benefits payable under this Agreement all taxes that the Company reasonably determines to be required pursuant to any law, regulation, or ruling. However, it is your obligation to pay all required taxes on any amounts provided under this Agreement, regardless of whether withholding is required. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6. Confidentiality. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, you will not disclose, in whole or in part, any of the terms of this Agreement. However, you may disclose the terms of this Agreement to your spouse or to your legal and financial advisors, provided that you take all reasonable measures to assure that he or she does not disclose the terms of this Agreement to a third party except as otherwise required by law. 

  

 7\. Governing Law. The provisions of this Agreement will be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, determined without regard to its choice of law rules. 

   

 8\. Definitions 

    

(a) Sale. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Sale" will be deemed to occur
upon the consummation of the sale of the portfolio of contracts and other
assets determined by Anteon to constitute the Business. 

   

(b) Effective Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Effective Date" shall
be the date upon which the closing of the Sale occurs. 

   

(b) Affiliates. For purposes of this Agreement, an "affiliate" shall mean
another person, company or other legal entity that, directly or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT  

  

 This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of ___, 2006 by and between ANTEON CORPORATION, a Virginia corporation (the " _Seller_ "), and ALION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the " _Parent_ "). 

   

 WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated [ _ _], 2006 (as amended or supplemented from time to time in accordance with its terms, the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), by and among the Seller, Parent, and Alion Technical Services Corporation, a subsidiary of Parent corporation and a Delaware corporation (the " _Buyer_ "), the Seller has agreed to sell, and the Buyer has agreed to acquire the Purchased Assets and assume the Assumed Liabilities, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement; and 

   

 WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the Seller and the Parent have agreed that the Seller or its Affiliates will provide to the Parent certain transition services that may be useful to effect the orderly transition of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities from the Seller to the Buyer; 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the value, receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each of the Seller and the Parent agrees as follows: 

   

 Section 1\. _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to such terms in the Purchase Agreement. 

   

 Section 2\. _Transition Services_. During the Term (as defined in _Section 5(a)_), the Seller will provide, or cause one or more of its Affiliates to provide to the Parent with respect to the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, the services more particularly described on _Appendix A_ (collectively, the " _Transition Services_ "). The Parent will adhere to any conditions or policies applicable to its use of the Transition Services as set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 Section 3\. _Nature of the Transition Services_. 

   

 (a) _Level of Service_. The Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Transition Services to be performed in the manner and at a relative level of service and care substantially similar to that performed by the Seller in connection with the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities during the six month period immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) _Priorities_. The Seller and the Parent shall mutually establish priorities, as between the Seller and the Parent, as to the provision of any Transition Service; provided, that the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain sufficient resources to perform the Transition Services in accordance with this Agreement, and provided 

   ##### 

  

    

further, to the extent applicable, that such prioritization shall be
consistent with the Sellers practices during the six month period
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Each Party shall cause its employees
and, as appropriate, its Affiliates that perform or provide any Transition
Service to cooperate in good faith and in a professional and workmanlike
manner with employees of the other to the extent reasonably required for the
delivery of the Transition Services. 

  

 (c) _Level of Use_. The Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to end its reliance on the Transition Services as soon as reasonably possible following the Closing Date. Except as set forth on _Appendix A_, as the Parent or the Seller may otherwise agree in writing or as otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, the Parents use of any Transition Service will not be greater than the level of use required by the Seller with respect to the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities during the six month period immediately prior to the Closing Date. In no event will the Parent be entitled to increase its use of any of the Transition Services above that level of use without the prior written consent of the Seller. 

  

 (d) _Use of Services_. The Seller shall provide the Transition Services to the Parent for substantially the same purpose and in substantially the same manner as the Seller used such Transition Services with respect to the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities during the six month period prior to the Closing Date. The Parent shall not, and shall not permit its employees, agents or Affiliates to, resell any Transition Services to any third party or permit the use of any Transition Services by any third party other than in connection with the conduct of the Parents business in the ordinary course. 

  

 (e) _Other Services_. If, after the execution of this Agreement, the Parent reasonably determines that a service provided in connection with any of the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities as performed by the Seller prior to the Closing Date was inadvertently omitted from  _Appendix A_ to this Agreement, then the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to add those services to this Agreement, and upon reaching such an agreement such services shall be deemed to be "Transition Services" for purposes of this Agreement. The charges for such services will be determined on a basis consistent with the methodology for determining the charges for other Transition Services as provided for in _Appendix A_ of this Agreement. 

  

 (f) _Third Parties_. The Parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary or required consent from any third party that is necessary for the Transition Services to be provided, in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of any applicable agreements between such third parties and the Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable. If any third party withholds such consent, the Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain replacement services. Subject to _Section 3(a)_, the Seller shall have the right to renegotiate any third party lease or agreement relating to any Transition Service, including changing service providers (notwithstanding any reference to a specific service provider that may be described on _Appendix A_). All reasonable fees and expenses arising in connection with obtaining such third party consents and replacement services shall be paid by the Parent. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) _Access to the Parent_. The Parent shall make available on a timely basis to the Seller, or such other Person providing the Transition Services, all information and materials reasonably requested by such Person to enable it to provide the Transition Services. During the Term, the Parent shall provide the employees and agents of the Seller, or such other Person providing the Transition Services, with all necessary access to its premises to provide the Transition Services, provided that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations at such premises. 

  

 (h) _Financial Statements_. In order to assist the Parent in its preparation of financial statements related to the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities (the " _Financial Statements_ ") and any audit thereof, during the Term, the Seller shall allow the Parent access to its accounting records and personnel related to the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities at such times and in such manner as the Parent may reasonably request. In connection with the foregoing, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Parents efforts to obtain access by the Parent or its accountants or auditors to the working papers maintained by the Sellers auditors related to the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities. The Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the Parents reasonable requests for assistance required for the preparation of the Financial Statements and the audit thereof, including any appropriate and customary management representation letters as may be reasonably required by the Parents auditors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent and the Seller agree and acknowledge that the Parent is responsible for the preparation and content of the Financial Statements and that Sellers assistance pursuant to this section will be of an ancillary nature. The Seller acknowledges that the Parent may be required to provide Financial Statements in a timely manner pursuant to Regulation S-X, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts as set forth above to assist the Parent in that regard. 

  

 Section 4\. _No Obligation to Continue to Use Services; Partial Termination_. The Parent will have no obligation to continue to use any of the Transition Services and may terminate any Transition Service, in whole or in part, by giving the Seller not less than 30 days prior written notice (or such longer notice as is required under an agreement with any third party providing, or relating to, any Transition Service) of its desire to terminate any particular Transition Service, in whole or in part (the " _Termination Notice_ "). As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of the Termination Notice (but no later than 15 days prior to the effective date of the termination as specified in a Termination Notice (the " _Effective Date_ ")), the Seller will advise the Parent whether the termination of such Transition Service will require the termination or partial termination of any other Transition Services from the same third party provider that are related to or dependent upon the Transition Service the Parent seeks to terminate, or will result in any early termination costs related to third party providers that would be payable as a result of the Parent terminating such service prior to the full term of such Transition Service (which third party costs, if any, will be borne by the Parent). If such third party costs would be triggered as a result of such termination, then the Parent may withdraw its Termination Notice within 10 days after receipt of such notice from the Seller, and upon such withdrawal, the Transition Services shall continue to be provided by the Seller without interruption; provided that the Seller has not, at the Parents request, delivered a termination notice to any third party provider of such Transition Services. If the Parent does not withdraw the Termination Notice within such period, such termination will be final and binding and shall 

   ##### 

  

    

be deemed effective as of the Effective Date. Upon such termination or the
expiration of the term of such Transition Service as set forth in _Appendix
A_, the Parents obligation to pay any fees applicable to the provision of
such terminated or expired Transition Service (or part thereof) with respect
to the period following the Effective Date, and the Sellers obligation
to provide such terminated or expired Transition Service (or part thereof)
with respect to the period following the Effective Date, will terminate. 

  

 Section 5\. _Term, Termination and Extension_. 

  

 (a) _Term_. Subject to _Section 4_ and the remainder of this _Section 5_, the term of this Agreement will commence on the date hereof and continue with respect to each of the Transition Services until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2006 or (ii) the termination of the final Transition Service pursuant to _Section 4_; provided, however, that to the extent any of the Transition Services set forth in _Appendix A_ provides for a later or earlier term, then that term shall control with respect to such Transition Service (the " _Term_ ") . The last date in the Term is referred to herein as the " _Termination Date._ " 

  

 (b) _Termination_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated by the Seller, (i) upon 60 days written notice if the Parent materially breaches or is in default of any payment obligation and does not cure such breach or default within such 60 day period; (ii) immediately by giving written notice to the Parent if (A) the Parent ceases to do business as a going concern without an assignment of its rights and obligations to a successor in interest; (B) the Parent applies for, or consents to, the appointment of a trustee, receiver or other custodian, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (C) the Parent becomes insolvent or generally fails to pay, or admits in writing its inability to pay, its debts as they become due; (D) the Parent commences or has commenced against it any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement, or other case or proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any dissolution or liquidation proceedings and, if such case or proceeding is commenced against it, such case or proceeding is not dismissed within 60 days thereafter; (E) any substantial part of the Parents property is or becomes subject to any levy, seizure, assignment or sale for or by any creditor or governmental agency without being released or satisfied within 10 days thereafter or (F) with respect to a particular Transition Service, the Sellers fulfillment of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement related to such particular Transition Service conflicts with, as reasonably determined by the Seller, any existing or future agreements or arrangements with the U.S. Government with respect to the avoidance, resolution or mitigation of "Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interests," as that term is used in Subpart 9.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 C.F.R. Sec. 9.500 _et seq._ ); or (iii) as to any particular Transaction Service pursuant to _Section 4_. 

  

 (c) _Effect of Termination_. Upon the termination of this Agreement or the expiration of the Term, all rights and obligations of the Parties will immediately cease and terminate, and no Party will have any further obligation to the other Party with respect to this Agreement, except (i) for charges accrued but unpaid as of the date of such termination or expiration, (ii) as set forth in the provisions of this Agreement that are specifically designated herein as surviving such termination or expiration, and (iii) for the rights and obligations pursuant to _Sections 10_ and _12_ , which will survive such termination or expiration. Upon the termination of this Agreement or any particular Transition Service or the expiration of the Term, 

   ##### 

  

    

the Parties shall cooperate in order to transfer or store (at the Parents
reasonable expense) all books, records and files directly related to the
Transition Services and take all other actions necessary to provide the
Parent with sufficient information to make alternate arrangements to perform
or obtain from third parties comparable Transition Services. Subject to
_Section 12(m)_ , the Seller may make duplicates of such books, records or
files for its legal records at its own cost. 

  

 Section 6\. _Fees_. 

   

 (a) _Compensation for Transition Services_. 

  

 (i) As consideration for the Transition Services, Parent will pay to Seller an amount equal to Sellers fully-burdened cost (excluding general and administrative and overhead expenses) incurred by the Seller in providing such Transition Services; provided that any Transition Services provided by third parties will be charged to Parent based on actual payments made by Seller or its Affiliates for such Transition Services. Any charges based on a monthly or other time basis will be pro rated based on actual days elapsed during the period of service. 

  

 (ii) The charges for the Transition Services set forth on _Appendix A_ are based on certain assumptions acknowledged and agreed to by the Parties regarding the underlying costs of providing the Transition Services. If events occur that cause a material change in the underlying costs of providing the Transition Services, the Seller and the Parent hereby agree to negotiate in good faith in order to (A) provide for a proper refund to the Parent if the Seller has already been paid for the Transition Services and the charges therefor have been overestimated, (B) provide for a proper supplemental payment to the Seller if the Seller has already been paid for the Transition Services and the charges therefor have been underestimated and (C) adjust the charges that the Parent will be required to pay going forward for the continued provision of the Transition Services. 

  

 (b) _Payment_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Seller shall invoice the Parent monthly in arrears for the Transition Services. Except as otherwise expressly provided in _Appendix A_, payment in U.S. dollars shall be made by the Parent within 30 days after receipt of any invoice. During such 30 day period, the Parent may reasonably dispute the amounts set forth on the invoice and provide the Seller written notification detailing the grounds for the dispute. If the Parent does not dispute the invoice within such period, the invoice will be deemed accepted and shall be deemed undisputed. The Parent shall not withhold any payments to the Seller under this Agreement, and the Seller shall not withhold the provision of any Transition Services to the Parent, during the period that any good faith dispute may be pending between the Seller and the Parent under this Agreement (any required adjustment being made on subsequent invoices). 

  

 (c) _Payment Processing_. The Parent agrees to pay a finance charge on past due amounts equal to the Prime Rate (as defined below) plus 2% per annum or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by Law. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Prime Rate" means a rate equal to the prime rate of interest announced from time to time by Citibank N.A. (the " _Bank_ ") at its principal office in New York, New York. The Prime Rate will change on the 

   ##### 

  

    

same day as any change in such rate announced by the Bank. The statement by
the Bank as to what the Prime Rate was on any given day will be conclusive.
In the event that the Bank should cease to publish a prime rate, the prime
rate listed in the _Wall Street Journal_ will be an acceptable substitute
therefor. All payments hereunder will be payable to the Seller pursuant
to wire transfer or other instructions provided to the Parent by the
Seller. 

  

 Section 7\. _Personnel_. 

   

 (a) _Right to Designate and Change Personnel_. The Seller, its Affiliates and any third parties providing Transition Services hereunder will have the right, in their discretion, to designate which of their personnel will be assigned to perform the Transition Services, including, subject to _Section 12(a)_, the right to remove and replace any such personnel at any time or to designate an Affiliate to perform any or all of the Transition Services. The Seller may designate a third party to perform or cause a third party to provide any or all of the Transition Services, but if such third party was not providing the Seller such Transition Service on the Closing Date, the Seller must first obtain the Parents prior consent to having such third party provide such Transition Service, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 (b) _Seller Transition Manager_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Seller will appoint one of its employees (the " _Seller Transition Manager_ ") who will have overall responsibility for managing and coordinating the delivery of the Transition Services during the Term and will coordinate and consult with the Parent Transition Manager (as defined below). The Seller may, in its discretion, select other individuals to serve in the capacity of the Seller Transition Manager during the Term after providing prior written notice to the Parent. 

  

 (c) _Parent Transition Manager_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Parent will appoint one of its employees (the " _Parent Transition Manager_ ") who will have overall responsibility for managing and coordinating the delivery of the Transition Services during the Term and will coordinate and consult with the Seller Transition Manager. The Parent may, in its discretion, select other individuals to serve in the capacity of the Parent Transition Manager during the Term after providing prior written notice to the Parent. 

  

 (d) _Authority_. The Seller Transition Manager and the Parent Transition Manager shall have the authority to bind their respective companies to modifications of _Appendix A_ only pursuant to communications given in accordance with Sections 12(a) and (i), and will be responsible for their respective Partys monitoring of the status of the Transition Services provided under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8\. _Proprietary Rights; Software_. 

   

 (a) _Third-Party Software_. All fees and expenses arising in connection with obtaining the consents, approvals or authorizations of any third parties with respect to software that is used in connection with the provision of any Transition Services hereunder shall be paid by the Parent. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, the Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consent that may be required from such licensors in order to provide any of the Transition Services hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Seller Software_. Any software, development tools, know-how, methodologies, processes, technologies, or algorithms owned by the Seller and which may during the Term be operated or used by the Seller or its Affiliates in connection with the performance of the Transition Services hereunder, will remain the Sellers property and neither the Parent will have any rights or interests therein. 

  

 (c) _Proprietary Rights_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in _Appendix A_ , nothing in this Agreement will be deemed or considered to grant to the Parent a license (whether express or implied) of any intellectual property or proprietary rights owned or licensed by the Seller or its Affiliates, or otherwise grant or transfer any rights therein to the Parent. The Seller and its Affiliates hereby reserve any and all rights under such intellectual property and proprietary rights not expressly granted to the Parent (if any) in _Appendix A_. 

  

 Section 9\. _IT Services_. 

   

 (a) _Information Policies_. While using any data processing or communications services of the Seller (whether or not identified on _Appendix A_), the Parent will adhere in all respects to the Sellers corporate information policies (including polices with respect to protection of proprietary information and other policies regarding the use of computing resources) as in effect from time to time and provided in advance to the Parent. 

  

 (b) _Data and System Conversion Plan_. The Seller and the Parent will jointly develop mutually acceptable a data and system conversion plan as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. The Seller and the Parent each agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the other to meet the mutually agreed upon milestones, timelines and resource requirements identified in the final detailed systems conversion plan. Following this process, the plan will be considered firm and will be used by both the Seller and the Parent to synchronize their own related project efforts. Any schedule modifications occurring after the plan is firm will require joint approval by the Seller and the Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 (c) _Computing Capacity_. If providing the Transition Services will require the Seller to purchase additional computing capacity, the Parent and the Seller will jointly agree on mutually acceptable means of sharing the cost of such additional capacity. 

  

 Section 10\. _Limitation on Warranty; Limitation on Liability_. 

   

 (a) _LIMITATION ON WARRANTY_. THE PARENT HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE SELLER HAS AGREED TO PROVIDE THE TRANSITION SERVICES HEREUNDER IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER THE SELLER NOR ITS AFFILIATES MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSITION SERVICES OR THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, AVAILABILITY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS OR THE RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED 

    ##### 

 

    

FROM SUCH TRANSITION SERVICES, AND THE SELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES HEREBY
DISCLAIM THE SAME. NEITHER THE SELLER NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES GUARANTEES OR
WARRANTS THE CORRECTNESS, COMPLETENESS, CURRENTNESS, MERCHANTABIITY OR
FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY DATA PROVIDED TO THE PARENT. 

   

 (b) _Limitation of Liability_. 

   

 (i) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER IN RESPECT OF A CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR OTHER SPECIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, GOODWILL, USE, INCOME, PROFITS OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS, BUSINESS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, SAVINGS, DATA OR BUSINESS REPUTATION), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER THEORY, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PARTY AGAINST WHICH SUCH CLAIM IS MADE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF, KNEW OF, OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

  

 (ii) THE PARENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SELLER IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING SERVICES OF THE TYPE CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT THE TRANSITION SERVICES ARE TO BE PROVIDED ON A TEMPORARY BASIS TO THE PARENT TO ASSIST WITH THE ORDERLY TRANSITION OF THE PURCHASED ASSETS AND ASSUMED LIABILITIES FROM THE SELLER TO THE PARENT. ACCORDINGLY, THE SELLERS MAXIMUM LIABILITY TO THE PARENT ARISING UNDER OR IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSITION SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER WILL BE LIMITED TO AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY THE PARENT FOR THE APPLICABLE TRANSITION SERVICE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATION ON LIABILITY IN THIS _SECTION 10(b)(ii)_ WILL NOT APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS BY THE PARENT ARISING AS A RESULT OF THE SELLERS GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUDULENT OR BAD FAITH ACTIONS. 

  

 (c) _Survival_. This _Section 10_ shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason. 

   

 Section 11\. _Dispute Resolution_. In the event of any dispute, claim, question or disagreement between the Parties hereto arising from or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, the Parties shall use their best efforts to settle the dispute, claim, question or disagreement. To this effect, the Parent Transition Manager and the Seller Transition Manager shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both Parties. If they do not reach such solution within a period of 30 days, then, upon notice by either Party to the other, all disputes, claims, questions or disagreements shall be finally settled by arbitration administered 

   ##### 

  

 

by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of
its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The
place of arbitration shall be Falls Church, Virginia The arbitrator shall not
have the authority to award (a) punitive, exemplary or other special damages,
or any indirect, incidental or consequential damages of any kind, including
consequential damages arising out of or resulting from business interruption
or loss of customers, goodwill, use, income, profits or anticipated profits,
business or business opportunity, savings, data or business reputation,
regardless of whether such damages are based in contract, breach of warranty,
tort, negligence or any other theory, and regardless of whether the Party
against which such claim is made has been advised of, knew of, or should have
known of the possibility of such damages, or (b) an amount of damages against
the Seller in excess of the limitation on liability contained in _Section
10(b)(ii)_. All costs and expenses of the Arbitrator and the American
Arbitration Association shall be borne by the Parties equally; each Party
shall bear the costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, of its own
counsel, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of its case.
Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof. 

   

 Section 12\. _General_. 

   

 (a) _Amendment; Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement may be amended only by the execution and delivery of a written instrument by or on behalf of the Seller and the Parent and provided that communications concerning such amendment are provided as set forth in _Section 11(i)_ at least 5 business days prior to the execution of such amendment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations provided by this Agreement may be assigned by either of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that, subject to _Section 7(a)_, the Seller may delegate its duties hereunder to such third parties as may be qualified to provide the Transition Services so long as such delegation does not result in increased costs to the Parent for such Transition Services. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 (b) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, _Appendix A_ and the other documents referred to herein collectively constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein and supersede any prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, that may have related in any way to the subject matter hereof. 

  

 (c) _Force Majeure_. Neither Party will be liable to the other for any loss, claim or damage as a result of any delay or failure in the performance of any obligation hereunder, directly or indirectly caused by or resulting from any act or event beyond such Partys control, including: acts of the government; acts of God; acts of third persons; strikes, embargoes, delays in the mail, transportation and delivery; power failures and shortages; fires; floods; epidemics and unusually severe weather conditions; or other causes beyond the control of such Party; provided, however, that no event of force majeure shall relieve the Parent from its payment obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Transition Services actually performed hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Party. The use of the word "including" in this Agreement means "including without limitation" and is intended by the Parties to be by way of example rather than limitation. _Appendix A_ will be construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to the same extent as if set forth verbatim herein. 

  

 (e) _No Conflict_. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will prevail. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties agree that the rights and remedies set forth in this Agreement are the sole rights and remedies of the Parties under this Agreement and that Article X of the Purchase Agreement does not apply to this Agreement. Except as provided in this _Section 12(e)_ , nothing contained herein will be deemed to alter, modify, expand or diminish the terms of the Purchase Agreement. 

  

 (f) _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or any portion hereof is held to be prohibited by or invalid under Law, such provision or portion hereof will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or this Agreement. 

  

 (g) _No Third-Party Beneficiary_. Except to the extent expressly set forth herein with respect to Affiliates of the Seller, this Agreement will not confer third party beneficiary rights or remedies upon any Person or entity other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and the Indemnified Parties under _Section 10(c)_. 

  

 (h) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same Agreement. 

  

 (i) _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder will be in writing and delivered personally, sent by reputable, overnight courier service (charges prepaid), sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, or sent by facsimile, according to the instructions set forth below. Such notices will be deemed given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; one business day after being sent, if sent by reputable, overnight courier service; three business days after being mailed, if sent by registered or certified mail; and at the time when confirmation of successful transmission is received by the sending facsimile machine if sent by facsimile.

 (j) _Relationship of the Parties_. The Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Parent, on the other hand, will not be deemed by virtue of this Agreement to be partners or joint venturers, and their relationship as hereby established is that of an independent contractor to the other Party. In matters relating to this Agreement, each Party will be solely responsible for the acts of its employees and agents and such employees or agents will not be considered employees or agents of the other Party. Neither Party will have any right, power or authority to create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other except to the extent expressly provided herein. 

  

 (k) _Choice of Law/Venue_. ALL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY, AND INTERPRETATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES AND THE PARTIES AGREE AND CONSENT TO EXCLUSIVE VENUE AND JURISDICTION IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS OF DELAWARE FOR ANY ACTION RELATING TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING AND WAIVE ANY DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT FORUM IN CONNECTION WITH THE MAINTENANCE OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SO BROUGHT. EACH PARTY FURTHER AGREES NOT TO BRING ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY OTHER COURT. The Parties further agree and consent to accept service of process by certified or registered United States mail, return receipt requested, addressed as provided herein. Nothing in this _Section 12(k)_, however, will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (l) _Compliance with Laws_. Each Party will comply with all Laws governing the Transition Services to be provided hereunder. No Party will take any action in violation of any Law that could result in liability being imposed on the other Party. The Seller shall promptly notify the Parent of any compliance problems in connection with the Transition Services of which the Seller becomes aware. 

  

 (m) _Confidentiality_. The Parent and Seller agree and acknowledge that in connection with performing its obligations hereunder, the Seller may have access or come into contact with highly confidential or proprietary information belonging, or relating, to the Parent and its business. For a period commencing on the date of this Agreement and terminating five (5) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, each of the Parties will, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates to, keep confidential (except as may be disclosed to the Parties Affiliates, attorneys, auditors or other representatives in the course of the provision and receipt of the Transition Services in accordance with the terms hereof) and not knowingly use in a manner that would reasonably be expected to have a detrimental effect on the other Party or its Affiliates, any and all confidential and proprietary disclosed by either party in connection with the Transition Services and the transactions contemplated hereby. Any and all confidential and proprietary information disclosed by either Party will remain the sole property of the disclosing party and the other party shall have no interest or rights with repsect to such confidential and proprietary information. The foregoing will not preclude either Party or its Affiliates from (a) disclosing such confidential or proprietary information if compelled to disclose the same by judicial or administrative process or by other Law (subject to the following provisions of this _Section 12(m)_), (b) discussing or using such confidential or proprietary information if the same hereafter is in the public domain (other than as a result of a breach of this _Section 12(m)_) or (c) discussing or using such confidential or proprietary information if the same is acquired from a Person that is not known to such Party or its Affiliates to be under an obligation to keep such information confidential. If either Party or its Affiliates is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal, administrative, arbitration or other formal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any such confidential or proprietary information, such Party will use reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other Party of any such request or requirement so that the other Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 12(m)_. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the other Party, the Party required to make such disclosure or its Affiliate may, without liability hereunder, disclose that portion of such information which it believes in good faith it is legally required to disclose. 

  

 (n) _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, each of the Parent and the Seller will bear their own costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not such transactions are consummated. In the event of any litigation arising out of this Agreement, except as provided in _Section 11_ with respect to any arbitration action, the losing Party shall pay to the prevailing Party all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and costs, in connection with such litigation. 

  

 (o) _Extension of Time; Waiver_. The Parties may extend the time for performance of or waive compliance with, any of the covenants, agreements or conditions of the 

   ##### 

  

 

other Party to this Agreement, and may waive any breach of such other Party.
No agreement extending or waiving any provision of this Agreement will be
valid or binding unless it is in writing and is executed and delivered by or
on behalf of the Party against which it is sought to be enforced. No failure
on the part of any Party to exercise, or any delay in exercising any right
hereunder, will be deemed a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial
exercise preclude any further or other exercise of such or any other right. 

   

 (p) _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and will not constitute a part of this Agreement.

 2. The rights, title and interest assigned under _Section 1_ above shall be for Assignees own use and enjoyment, and for the use and enjoyment of Assignees successors, assigns or other legal representatives, as fully and entirely as the same would have been held and enjoyed by Assignor if this assignment and sale had not been made. 

  

 3. This Intellectual Property Assignment, together with the Asset Purchase Agreement and all documents executed in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between and among the parties hereto with respect to the matters set forth herein, and supersedes and replaces any prior agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, between and among them with respect to such matters. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Intellectual Property Assignment to the contrary, nothing contained in this Intellectual Property Assignment shall supersede, modify, replace, amend, change, rescind, waive, exceed, expand, enlarge or in any way affect the provisions, including warranties, covenants, agreements, conditions, representations, or in general any of the rights and remedies, and any of the obligations and indemnifications of Assignor or Assignee set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement nor shall this Intellectual Property Assignment expand or enlarge any remedies under the Asset Purchase Agreement including without limitation any

transfer of certain property transferred pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement and shall be governed entirely in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement. 

  

 4. THIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSIGNMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY LAW OR RULE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO BE APPLIED.
