(including legal, accounting and investment banking fees and expenses) incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not such transactions are
consummated. Neither Party may make any offset against amounts due to the other Party pursuant to
this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or otherwise.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Section&nbsp;12.3 Disclosure Schedules. </I>The representations and warranties of the Seller set forth
in this Agreement are made and given subject to the disclosures contained in the Disclosure
Schedules. The Seller will not be, nor will it be deemed to be, in breach of any such
representations and warranties (and no claim will lie in respect thereof) in respect of any such
matter so disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules. References to any document in the Disclosure
Schedules do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the document itself.
Inclusion of information in the Disclosure Schedules will not be construed as an admission that
such information is material to the business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Purchased Assets. The specific disclosures set forth in the Disclosure Schedules have been
organized to correspond to section references in this Agreement to which the disclosure may be most
likely to relate, together with appropriate cross references when disclosure is applicable to other
sections of this Agreement; provided, however, that any disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules will
apply to and will be deemed to be disclosed for the purposes of this Agreement generally.

with the provisions of any bulk sales laws that may be applicable to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Section&nbsp;12.5 Assignment; Successors and Assigns. </I>Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations provided by this Agreement may be assigned by either Party
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party;
provided, however, that the Seller may, without the consent of the Buyer, assign any or all of the
Seller&#146;s rights and delegate any or all of the Seller&#146;s obligations hereunder to a DRE to which it
has transferred all or any portion of the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities provided,
however, that in the event of any such assignment by Seller to a DRE, Seller and DRE shall be
jointly and severally liable for all obligations delegated to such DRE. Subject to the preceding
sentence and except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Section&nbsp;12.6 Amendment; Waiver. </I>This Agreement may be amended by a written instrument
executed and delivered by the Seller and the Buyer. At any time prior to the Closing, the Parties
may extend the time for performance of or waive compliance with any of the covenants or agreements
of the other Party to this Agreement, and may waive any breach of the representations or warranties
of such other Party. No agreement extending or waiving any provision of this Agreement will be
valid or binding unless it is in writing and is executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Party
against which it is sought to be enforced.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Anteon Corporation (&#147;Anteon&#148;) intends to sell to a third party (the &#147;Buyer&#148; or
the &#147;Company&#148;) a portfolio of contracts under which Anteon provides a range of Program Management
and Engineering Services to certain customers (hereinafter the &#147;Business&#148;). Your contributions to
the success of the Business and your active involvement during the transition period subsequent to
such a Sale are important to Anteon and to the Buyer. Therefore, on behalf of Anteon, I am pleased
to offer you this retention agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;), which will provide financial incentives
for you to remain employed by the Buyer following the completion of the Sale.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of this Agreement, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of which shall only become effective as of the
Effective Date (as defined herein), are as follows:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Retention Incentive Payment. </B>On the Effective Date (as defined herein), you will be eligible
for a retention incentive payment in the amount of<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U> dollars ($<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>) (the &#147;Retention Incentive
Payment&#148;), subject to the following terms and conditions. The Retention Incentive Payment shall be
paid to you by the Buyer on the twelve (12)&nbsp;month anniversary of the closing date of the Sale.
However, you are not eligible to receive the Retention Incentive Payment if (a)&nbsp;the Sale does not
occur, (b)&nbsp;you are no longer employed by the Buyer at the time any such payment is due to be paid
because of your voluntary termination, resignation, death, disability or termination by the Buyer
for &#147;Cause,&#148; or (c)&nbsp;the Buyer of the Business requires, as a condition of the Sale, an employment
agreement with you (which agreement contains no adverse change in your salary or incentive
compensation) and you have not entered into such employment agreement with such Buyer as of the
closing date of the Sale, except for such ancillary non-employment agreements of the Company
providing for the protection and assignment of intellectual property executed by all of the Buyer&#146;s
employees. If your employment is terminated by the Buyer without Cause prior to the date that the
payment is due, you shall be entitled to receive the Retention Incentive Payment. If an Effective
Date does not occur within 6&nbsp;months following the date first written above, this Agreement shall
automatically terminate as of such date.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;) is entered into as of &#95;&#95;&#95;,
2006 by and between ANTEON CORPORATION, a Virginia corporation (the &#147;<U>Seller</U>&#148;), and ALION
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated &#091;<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>&#093;, 2006 (as amended or
supplemented from time to time in accordance with its terms, the &#147;<U>Purchase Agreement</U>&#148;), by
and among the Seller, Parent, and Alion Technical Services Corporation, a subsidiary of Parent
corporation and a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<U>Buyer</U>&#148;), the Seller has agreed to sell, and
the Buyer has agreed to acquire the Purchased Assets and assume the Assumed Liabilities, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement; and
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the
Seller and the Parent have agreed that the Seller or its Affiliates will provide to the Parent
certain transition services that may be useful to effect the orderly transition of the Purchased
Assets and Assumed Liabilities from the Seller to the Buyer;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual agreements contained herein,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the value, receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, each of the Seller and the Parent agrees as follows:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1. <U>Definitions</U>. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the
meanings given to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;2. <U>Transition Services</U>. During the Term (as defined in <U>Section&nbsp;5(a)</U>),
the Seller will provide, or cause one or more of its Affiliates to provide to the Parent with
respect to the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, the services more particularly described on <U>Appendix&nbsp;A</U> (collectively,
the &#147;<U>Transition Services</U>&#148;). The Parent will adhere to any conditions or policies
applicable to its use of the Transition Services as set forth in this Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3. <U>Nature of the Transition Services</U>.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>Level of Service</U>. The Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Transition Services to be performed in the manner and at a relative level of service and care
substantially similar to that performed by the Seller in connection with the Purchased Assets and
Assumed Liabilities during the six month period immediately prior to the Closing Date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Priorities</U>. The Seller and the Parent shall mutually establish priorities, as
between the Seller and the Parent, as to the provision of any Transition Service; provided, that
the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain sufficient resources to perform
the Transition Services in accordance with this Agreement, and provided

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">further, to the extent applicable, that such prioritization shall be consistent with the
Seller&#146;s practices during the six month period immediately prior to the Closing Date. Each Party
shall cause its employees and, as appropriate, its Affiliates that perform or provide any
Transition Service to cooperate in good faith and in a professional and workmanlike manner with
employees of the other to the extent reasonably required for the delivery of the Transition
Services.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;<U>Level of Use</U>. The Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to end its
reliance on the Transition Services as soon as reasonably possible following the Closing Date.
Except as set forth on <U>Appendix&nbsp;A</U>, as the Parent or the Seller may otherwise agree in
writing or as otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, the Parent&#146;s use of any Transition
Service will not be greater than the level of use required by the Seller with respect to the
Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities during the six month period immediately prior to the
Closing Date. In no event will the Parent be entitled to increase its use of any of the Transition
Services above that level of use without the prior written consent of the Seller.

for substantially the same purpose and in substantially the same manner as the Seller used such
Transition Services with respect to the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities during the six
month period prior to the Closing Date. The Parent shall not, and shall not permit its employees,
agents or Affiliates to, resell any Transition Services to any third party or permit the use of any
Transition Services by any third party other than in connection with the conduct of the Parent&#146;s
business in the ordinary course.

determines that a service provided in connection with any of the Purchased Assets or Assumed
Liabilities as performed by the Seller prior to the Closing Date was inadvertently omitted from
<U>Appendix&nbsp;A</U> to this Agreement, then the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to add those
services to this Agreement, and upon reaching such an agreement such services shall be deemed to be
&#147;Transition Services&#148; for purposes of this Agreement. The charges for such services will be
determined on a basis consistent with the methodology for determining the charges for other
Transition Services as provided for in <U>Appendix&nbsp;A</U> of this Agreement.

obtain any necessary or required consent from any third party that is necessary for the Transition
Services to be provided, in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of any applicable
agreements between such third parties and the Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable. If any third
party withholds such consent, the Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
replacement services. Subject to <U>Section&nbsp;3(a)</U>, the Seller shall have the right to
renegotiate any third party lease or agreement relating to any Transition Service, including
changing service providers (notwithstanding any reference to a specific service provider that may
be described on <U>Appendix&nbsp;A</U>). All reasonable fees and expenses arising in connection with
obtaining such third party consents and replacement services shall be paid by the Parent.

Seller, or such other Person providing the Transition Services, all information and materials
reasonably requested by such Person to enable it to provide the Transition Services. During the
Term, the Parent shall provide the employees and agents of the Seller, or such other Person
providing the Transition Services, with all necessary access to its premises to provide the
Transition Services, provided that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations at such premises.

financial statements related to the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities (the &#147;<U>Financial
Statements</U>&#148;) and any audit thereof, during the Term, the Seller shall allow the Parent access
to its accounting records and personnel related to the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities at
such times and in such manner as the Parent may reasonably request. In connection with the
foregoing, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Parent&#146;s
efforts to obtain access by the Parent or its accountants or auditors to the working papers
maintained by the Seller&#146;s auditors related to the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities. The
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the Parent&#146;s reasonable requests
for assistance required for the preparation of the Financial Statements and the audit thereof,
including any appropriate and customary management representation letters as may be reasonably
required by the Parent&#146;s auditors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent and the Seller agree
and acknowledge that the Parent is responsible for the preparation and content of the Financial
Statements and that Seller&#146;s assistance pursuant to this section will be of an ancillary nature.
The Seller acknowledges that the Parent may be required to provide Financial Statements in a timely
manner pursuant to Regulation&nbsp;S-X, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
the Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts as set forth above to assist the Parent in that
regard.

will have no obligation to continue to use any of the Transition Services and may terminate any
Transition Service, in whole or in part, by giving the Seller not less than 30&nbsp;days&#146; prior written
notice (or such longer notice as is required under an agreement with any third party providing, or
relating to, any Transition Service) of its desire to terminate any particular Transition Service,
in whole or in part (the &#147;<U>Termination Notice</U>&#148;). As soon as reasonably practicable
following receipt of the Termination Notice (but no later than 15&nbsp;days prior to the effective date
of the termination as specified in a Termination Notice (the &#147;<U>Effective Date</U>&#148;)), the Seller
will advise the Parent whether the termination of such Transition Service will require the
termination or partial termination of any other Transition Services from the same third party
provider that are related to or dependent upon the Transition Service the Parent seeks to
terminate, or will result in any early termination costs related to third party providers that
would be payable as a result of the Parent terminating such service prior to the full term of such
Transition Service (which third party costs, if any, will be borne by the Parent). If such third
party costs would be triggered as a result of such termination, then the Parent may withdraw its
Termination Notice within 10&nbsp;days after receipt of such notice from the Seller, and upon such
withdrawal, the Transition Services shall continue to be provided by the Seller without
interruption; provided that the Seller has not, at the Parent&#146;s request, delivered a termination
notice to any third party provider of such Transition Services. If the Parent does not withdraw
the Termination Notice within such period, such termination will be final and binding and shall

any payment obligation and does not cure such breach or default within such 60&nbsp;day period; (ii)

Parent commences or has commenced against it any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement, or

agency without being released or satisfied within 10&nbsp;days thereafter or (F)&nbsp;with respect to a
particular Transition Service, the Seller&#146;s fulfillment of its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement related to such particular Transition Service conflicts with, as reasonably determined by
the Seller, any existing or future agreements or arrangements with the U.S. Government with respect
to the avoidance, resolution or mitigation of &#147;Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of
Interests,&#148; as that term is used in Subpart 9.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 C.F.R.

certain assumptions acknowledged and agreed to by the Parties regarding the underlying costs of
providing the Transition Services. If events occur that cause a material change in the underlying
costs of providing the Transition Services, the Seller and the Parent hereby agree to negotiate in
good faith in order to (A)&nbsp;provide for a proper refund to the Parent if the Seller has already been
paid for the Transition Services and the charges therefor have been overestimated, (B)&nbsp;provide for
a proper supplemental payment to the Seller if the Seller has already been paid for the Transition
Services and the charges therefor have been underestimated and (C)&nbsp;adjust the charges that the
Parent will be required to pay going forward for the continued provision of the Transition
Services.

the Parent monthly in arrears for the Transition Services. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in <U>Appendix&nbsp;A</U>, payment in U.S. dollars shall be made by the Parent within 30&nbsp;days after
receipt of any invoice. During such 30&nbsp;day period, the Parent may reasonably dispute the amounts
set forth on the invoice and provide the Seller written notification detailing the grounds for the
dispute. If the Parent does not dispute the invoice within such period, the invoice will be deemed
accepted and shall be deemed undisputed. The Parent shall not withhold any payments to the Seller
under this Agreement, and the Seller shall not withhold the provision of any Transition Services to
the Parent, during the period that any good faith dispute may be pending between the Seller and the
Parent under this Agreement (any required adjustment being made on subsequent invoices).

equal to the Prime Rate (as defined below) plus 2% per annum or, if lower, the maximum rate
permitted by Law. For purposes of this Agreement, the term &#147;Prime Rate&#148; means a rate equal to the
prime rate of interest announced from time to time by Citibank N.A. (the &#147;<U>Bank</U>&#148;) at its
