                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

      THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into as
of April 23, 2005, by and among Click Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation
(the "Buyer"), Click Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory Subsidiary"), and DoubleClick
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

      WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Buyer and the Company deem it
advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and their respective
stockholders that the Buyer acquire the Company in order to advance the
long-term business interests of the Buyer and the Company;

      WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger
(the "Merger") of the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the "DGCL"), as a result of which the Company shall become a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Buyer; and

      WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary and the Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective

Agreement, at or prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall jointly
prepare and cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware a

by, and executed by the Company in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of Delaware or at such later time as is established
by the Buyer and the Company and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the
"Effective Time").

      1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at

satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction of
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the
delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the
Closing), at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 399 Park
Avenue, New York, New York, unless another
<PAGE>
date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Company. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Business Day" shall be any day other than (a) a
Saturday or Sunday or (b) a day on which banking institutions located in New
York, New York are permitted or required by law, executive order or governmental
decree to remain closed.

      1.3 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the separate existence
of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Transitory Subsidiary shall be
merged with and into the Company (the Company surviving the Merger is sometimes
referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

      1.4 Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth in
Exhibit A attached hereto and, as so amended and restated, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and as provided by applicable
law.

      1.5 By-laws. At the Effective Time, the By-laws of the Transitory
Subsidiary, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and as set
forth in Exhibit B attached hereto, shall become the By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-laws.

      1.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

            (a) The directors of the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to

each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

            (b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold

                                   ARTICLE II

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

      2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary:

            (a) Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary. Each share of the
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

            (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock. All shares
of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") that

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common
Stock owned by the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any other wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of the Buyer or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

            (c) Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock. Subject to
Section 2.2, each share of Company Common Stock (other than (i) shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b), (ii) shares owned by any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company which shall remain outstanding and (iii)
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.4(a) below)) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive $8.50 in cash per share (the "Merger Consideration"). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.

            (d) Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock
split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

      2.2 Exchange of Certificates. The procedures for exchanging certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the Merger are as follows:

            (a) Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time (or with
respect to the Merger Consideration expected to be funded out of cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities of the Company, as promptly as practicable
thereafter), the Buyer (or with respect to Merger Consideration expected to be
funded out of such cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of the
Company, the Company) shall deposit with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company
or another bank or trust company mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the
Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for
payment through the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2, cash in
an amount sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(c) in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (the "Exchange Fund").

            (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") (i) a letter
of transmittal in customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable
with respect

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Section 2.2.

            (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

            (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any
holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously complied with this Section
2.2 shall look only to the Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
similar laws) for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration without
interest.

            (e) No Liability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of
the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

            (f) Withholding Rights. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable state, local or foreign tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the
Buyer, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be.


                                      -4-
<PAGE>
            (g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

            (h) Stock Transfer Books. At the close of business, New York City
time, on the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or the Buyer for any reason shall be canceled
against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c).

      2.3 Company Stock Options.

            (a) The Company shall take such action as shall be required:

                  (i) to cause the vesting of any unvested options to purchase
Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Options") granted under any stock option
plans or other equity-related plans of the Company (the "Company Stock Plans")
to be accelerated in full effective immediately prior to the Effective Time;

                  (ii) to effectuate the cancellation, as of the Effective Time,
of all Company Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(without regard to the exercise price of such Company Stock Options); and

                  (iii) to cause each outstanding Company Stock Option to
represent on the first Business Day following the Effective Time solely the
right to receive, in accordance with this Section 2.3, a lump sum cash payment
in the amount of the Option Consideration (as defined below), if any, with
respect to such Company Stock Option to no longer represent the right to
purchase Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company, the
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any other person or any other consideration.

            (b) Each holder of a Company Stock Option shall receive from the
Buyer, in respect and in consideration of each Company Stock Option so
cancelled, on the first Business Day following the Effective Time, an amount
(net of applicable taxes) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A)
the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (B) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option (whether or not then vested or exercisable), without
any interest thereon (the "Option Consideration"). In the event that the
exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and have no
further force or effect.


                                      -5-
<PAGE>
            (c) As soon as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of Company
Stock Options a letter describing the treatment of and payment for such Company
Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing instructions for use in
obtaining payment for such Company Stock Options.

      2.4 Dissenting Shares.

            (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who is entitled to
demand and has made a demand for appraisal of such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the DGCL and has not voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement (any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares"
until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder's
appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares.

            (b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such
(through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the
Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall
automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, without interest thereon,
upon surrender of the Certificates representing such shares.

            (c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any
written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL that relate to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand,
notice or instrument unless the Buyer shall have given its written consent to
such payment or settlement offer.

                                   ARTICLE III

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary and dated as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"). The Company Disclosure Schedule
shall be arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and
lettered sections and paragraphs contained in this Article III, and the
disclosure in any Section or paragraph shall qualify (a) the corresponding
Section or paragraph in this Article III and (b) the

<PAGE>
other sections and paragraphs in this Article III to the extent that it is

incorporation, (ii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified to do business and, where applicable

leases or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary,
except (with respect to clause (iii) only) for such failures to be so qualified
or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, that are not reasonably
likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any material adverse
change, event, circumstance or development with respect to, or material adverse
effect on, the business, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any event
that would reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the
transactions consummated hereby; provided, however, that none of the following,
to the extent occurring after the date hereof, shall constitute, or shall be
considered in determining whether there has occurred, a Company Material Adverse
Effect:

                  (i) changes that are the result of economic factors affecting
the national or world economy or acts of war or terrorism, except to the extent
that such changes have a materially disproportionate effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries relative to other similarly situated participants in the
industries or markets in which they operate;

                  (ii) changes that are the result of factors generally
affecting the industries or markets in which the Company operates, except to the
extent that such changes have a materially disproportionate effect on the
Company and its Subsidiaries relative to other similarly situated participants
in the industries or markets in which they operate;

                  (iii) changes in law, rule or regulations or generally
accepted accounting principles or the interpretation thereof;

                  (iv) any action taken pursuant to or in accordance with this

Buyer;

                  (v) any fees or expenses reasonably incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

                  (vi) any failure by the Company to meet any published
estimates of revenues or earnings for any period ending on or after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Closing (it being understood that the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such failure may be deemed to constitute and shall
be taken into account in determining whether there has been a Company Material
Adverse Effect); and

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
                  (vii) a decline in the price of the Company Common Stock on
The NASDAQ National Market (it being understood that the facts and circumstances
giving rise to such decline may be deemed to constitute and shall be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse
Effect).

true and correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company, each as amended to date (together, the "Company Charter Documents"),
and each such instrument is in full force and effect and no other organizational
documents are applicable to or binding upon the Company. The Company is not in
violation in any material respect of any of the provisions of the Company
Charter Documents.

Subsidiaries to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, otherwise modify or
amend or enter into any such option, warrant, equity security, call, right,
commitment or agreement. The Company does not have any outstanding stock
appreciation rights, phantom stock, performance based rights or similar rights
or obligations. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates is a party to or
is bound by any agreements or understandings with respect to the voting
(including voting trusts and proxies) or sale or transfer (including agreements
imposing transfer restrictions) of any shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Affiliate"
when used with respect to any party shall mean any person who is an "affiliate"
of that party within the meaning of Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Except as contemplated by this
Agreement, there are no registration rights, and there is no rights agreement,
"poison pill," anti-takeover plan or other similar Contract with respect to any
equity security of any class of the Company.

            (d) All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and all
shares of Company Common Stock subject to issuance as specified in Section
3.2(b) above, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the
instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in
violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,
preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any provision of
the DGCL, the Company Charter Documents or any agreement to which the Company is
a party or is otherwise bound.

            (e) There are no obligations, commitments or arrangements,
contingent or otherwise, of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
Affiliates to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company
Common Stock or the capital stock of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of its Affiliates.

            (f) Section 3.2(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and correct list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each Contract
pursuant to which any Indebtedness (as defined below) of the Company or its
Subsidiaries is outstanding or may be incurred or guaranteed in an amount in
excess of $250,000, together with the amount outstanding thereunder as of the
date of this Agreement. "Indebtedness" means (i) indebtedness for borrowed
money, whether secured or unsecured, (ii) obligations under conditional or
installment sale or other title retention agreement or arrangement relating to
purchased property, (iii) capitalized lease obligations and (iv) guarantees of
any of the foregoing of another person. No event has occurred which either
entitles, or could entitle (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) the
holder of any Indebtedness described in Section 3.2(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule to accelerate, or which does accelerate, the maturity of any such
Indebtedness.

      3.3 Subsidiaries.

<PAGE>
jurisdiction of organization; and (iii) the number of its outstanding shares of
capital stock and the record and beneficial owner thereof (or a statement that
the Company or a Material Subsidiary owns all of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of such Material Subsidiary). For purposes of this Agreement, (i)
the term "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any party, any corporation,
partnership, trust, limited liability company or other non-corporate business
enterprise in which such party (or another Subsidiary of such party) holds stock
or other ownership interests representing (A) more that 50% of the voting power
of all outstanding stock or ownership interests of such entity, (B) the right to
receive more than 50% of the net assets of such entity available for
distribution to the holders of outstanding stock or ownership interests upon a
liquidation or dissolution of such entity or (C) a general or managing
partnership interest in such entity, and (ii) the term "Material Subsidiary"
means, with respect to the Company, any subsidiary listed on Exhibit 21.1 to the
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") on March 16, 2005 pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

            (b) Each Material Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation,
partnership or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (to the extent such concepts are applicable) under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, has all requisite corporate
or other power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be
conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation or entity (to the extent such concepts are applicable) in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, operated or
leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary,
except for such failures to be so organized, validly existing or in good
standing, to have such power and authority or to be so qualified or in good
standing that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock and other equity securities or interests of each Material
Subsidiary of the Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and all such shares (other than
directors' qualifying shares in the case of non-U.S. Subsidiaries, all of which
the Company has the power to cause to be transferred for no or nominal
consideration to the Company or the Company's designee) are owned, of record and
beneficially, by the Company or another of its Subsidiaries free and clear of
all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in the
Company's voting rights, charges or other encumbrances. There are no outstanding
or authorized options, warrants, rights, agreements or commitments to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or which are binding on any of
them providing for the issuance, disposition or acquisition of any capital stock
of any Material Subsidiary of the Company. There are no outstanding stock
appreciation, phantom stock or similar rights with respect to any Material
Subsidiary of the Company. There are no voting trusts, proxies or other
agreements or understandings with respect to the voting of any capital stock of
any Material Subsidiary of the Company.

            (c) The Company has made available to the Buyer complete and
accurate copies of the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of
each Material Subsidiary of the Company (the "Subsidiary Charter Documents"),
and each such instrument is in full force and effect and no other organizational
documents are applicable to or binding upon such

                                      -10-
<PAGE>
Subsidiaries. None of the Subsidiaries is in violation in any material respect
of any of the provisions of its Subsidiary Charter Documents.

            (d) The Company does not control directly or indirectly or have any
direct or indirect equity participation or similar interest in any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other business
association or entity which is not a Subsidiary of the Company, other than
securities in a publicly traded company held for investment by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of less than 5% of the outstanding
capital stock of such company.

      3.4 Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

            (a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and, subject to the adoption of this Agreement (the
"Company Voting Proposal") by the Company's stockholders under the DGCL (the
"Company Stockholder Approval"), to perform its obligations and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board"), at a
meeting duly called and held, with all directors present voting in favor, (i)
determined that the Merger is fair and in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and declared its
advisability in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, and (iii) directed

of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company, subject only to the required receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights
and to general equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").

            (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do
not, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, any provision of the Company Charter Documents or the Subsidiary
Charter Documents, (ii) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of,
or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration
of any obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, require a consent or
waiver under, constitute a change in control under, require the payment of a
penalty or increased fees under or result in the imposition of any mortgage,
right of first refusal, claim, license, limitation in voting rights, security
interest, pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance ("Liens") on the Company's or any
of its Subsidiaries' assets under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any lease, license, contract, subcontract, indenture, note, option or other
agreement, instrument or obligation, written or oral, to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their
properties or assets may be bound (each, a "Contract"), or (iii) subject to
obtaining the

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
Company Stockholder Approval and compliance with the requirements specified in
clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 3.4(c), conflict with or violate any permit,
concession, franchise, license, judgment, injunction, order, writ, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule, or regulation applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective properties or assets, except
in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 3.4(b) for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
modifications, accelerations, losses, penalties, increased fees or Liens, and
for any consents or waivers not obtained, that, individually or in the
aggregate, are not reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

            (c) No consent, approval, action, license, permit, order,
certification, concession, franchise or authorization of, or registration,
declaration, notice or filing with, any federal, state or local, U.S. or foreign

Entity") or any stock market or stock exchange on which shares of Company Common
Stock are listed for trading is required by or with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) the
pre-merger notification requirements under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") and applicable foreign
antitrust or merger control laws, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate corresponding documents
with the appropriate authorities of other states in which the Company is
qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business in order to continue
such qualification, (iii) the filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC in
accordance with the Exchange Act, (iv) the filing of such reports, schedules or

hereby, and (v) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings as may be required under applicable state securities
laws, and (vi) such other consents, approvals, licenses, permits, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations, notices and filings which, if not
obtained or made, would not be, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

            (d) The affirmative vote for approval and adoption of the Company
Voting Proposal by the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock on the record date for the meeting of the
Company's stockholders (the "Company Meeting") to consider the Company Voting
Proposal (the "Required Company Stockholder Vote") is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the Company's capital stock or other
securities necessary for the approval and adoption of this Agreement and for the
consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. There are no bonds, Contracts, debentures, warrants, options, series
of capital stock, notes or other Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries
having the right to vote (or, except for the Company's Zero Coupon Notes and the
Company Warrants, convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for,

Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

            (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in

or, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as permitted by the
SEC on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly presented or will
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates indicated and the consolidated

recurring year-end adjustments. All of the Subsidiaries of the Company are
consolidated for accounting purposes. The consolidated, audited balance sheet of
the Company as of December 31, 2004 is referred to herein as the "Company
Balance Sheet."

            (c) Except with respect to information to be supplied by or on
behalf of the Buyer for inclusion in the proxy statement to be sent to the
stockholders of the Company in connection with the Company Meeting (the "Proxy
Statement"), the Proxy Statement and any other soliciting materials of the
Company shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement or such materials are first
mailed to stockholders of the Company, at the time of the Company Meeting or at

any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Company
Meeting which has become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the
Company Meeting any fact or event relating to the Company or any of its
Affiliates which should be set forth in a supplement to the

                                      -13-
<PAGE>
Proxy Statement should be discovered by the Company or should occur, the Company
shall, promptly after becoming aware thereof, inform the Buyer of such fact or
event.

            (d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures
required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all material information
concerning the Company is made known on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Company's filings with the SEC and other
public disclosure documents. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluations, to the Company's outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company (A) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are known to
the Company and reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any fraud, whether
or not material, known to the Company that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal control over
financial reporting. The Company is in compliance with the applicable listing
and other rules and regulations of The NASDAQ National Market.

            (e) The Company has made available to the Buyer a complete and
correct copy of any exhibits, annexes, attachments, supplements, amendments or
modifications that have not been filed with the SEC to all exhibits to the
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC on March 16, 2005
that have requested by the Buyer.

      3.6 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or in the Company Balance
Sheet, the Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities (i) incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or (iii) that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

      3.7 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Between the date of the Company
Balance Sheet and the date of this Agreement, except as disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken
any action which, if taken after the date hereof, would require the consent of
the Buyer under Section 5.1 of this Agreement. Since the date of the Company
Balance Sheet, there has not been any change, event, circumstance or development
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

      3.8 Taxes.

            (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all
Tax Returns that they were required to file, and all such Tax Returns were
correct and complete, except for any failure to file or errors or omissions
that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its

                                      -14-
<PAGE>
Subsidiaries have paid on a timely basis all Taxes due and payable (whether or
not shown on any such Tax Returns). The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for Tax periods through the date of the Company Balance Sheet do
not exceed the accruals and reserves for Taxes set forth on the Company Balance
Sheet exclusive of any accruals and reserves for "deferred taxes" or similar
items that reflect timing differences between Tax and financial accounting
principles. All liabilities for Taxes that arose since the date of the Company
Balance Sheet arose in the ordinary course of business. All Taxes that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was required by law to withhold or
collect have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have
been paid to the proper Governmental Entity, except for any such Taxes with
respect to which the failure to withhold, collect or pay is not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. There are no liens or encumbrances with respect to Taxes upon any of the
assets or property of the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than liens for
Taxes not yet due and payable. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Taxes" means
all taxes, charges, fees, levies or other similar assessments or liabilities,
including income, gross receipts, ad valorem, premium, value-added, excise, real
property, personal property, sales, use, services, license alternative or add-on
minimum, transfer, withholding, employment, payroll and franchise taxes imposed
by the United States of America or any state, local or foreign government, or
any agency thereof, or other political subdivision of the United States or any
such government, and any interest, fines, penalties, assessments or additions to
tax resulting from, attributable to or incurred in connection with any tax or
any contest or dispute thereof and (ii) "Tax Returns" means all reports,
returns, declarations, statements or other information required to be supplied
to a taxing authority in connection with Taxes, including, without limitation,
any information return, claim for refund, amended return or declaration of
estimated Tax.

            (b) There are no deficiencies for any amount of Taxes claimed,
proposed or assessed by any taxing or other Governmental Entity in writing that
have not been fully paid, settled or accrued for. The Company has made available
to the Buyer correct and complete copies of all federal income Tax Returns,
examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to
by the Company since January 1, 2002. The federal income Tax Returns of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue
Service (the "IRS") or are closed by the applicable statute of limitations for
all taxable years through the taxable year specified in Section 3.8(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company has made available to the Buyer correct
and complete copies of all other Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries
together with all related examination reports and statements of deficiency for
all periods from and after January 1, 2002. No examination or audit of any Tax
Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity is
currently in progress or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened or
contemplated. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been informed
by any Governmental Entity that the Governmental Entity believes that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax Return that was
not filed. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any
statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to an extension of time
with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code; or (ii) has any actual or
potential liability for any Taxes of any person (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar

contract or otherwise.

            (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is or has

agreement.

            (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is required

this Agreement or (ii) is a party to an agreement that would require it to make
any payments, in each case that would not be fully deductible by reason of
Section 162(m) of the Code.

            (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been either
a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution
occurring during the last five years in which the parties to such distribution
treated the distribution as one to which Section 355 of the Code is applicable.

            (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed or is
required to make any adjustments for any taxable period, or portion thereof,
ending after the Closing Date pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law by reason of a change in
accounting method initiated by it or any other relevant party and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge that the IRS has proposed
any such adjustment or change in accounting method, nor has any application
pending with any Governmental Entity requesting permission for any changes in
accounting methods that relate to the business or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

            (h) The Company will not be required to include any item of income
in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable
period, or portion thereof, ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i)

corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law)
executed on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) intercompany transaction or
excess loss account described in the Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of

sole owners of good, valid, fee simple and marketable title to the Owned Real
Properties, including without limitation, all buildings, structures, fixtures
and improvements located thereon in each case free and clear of any Liens other

complete and accurate list as of the date of this Agreement of all real property
leased, subleased or licensed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

days notice without liability or financial obligation to the Company or (ii)
property subject to a Lease for which the payment by the Company is less than
$10,000 per month (collectively "Company Leases") and the location of the
premises. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Company's
knowledge, any other party to any Company Lease is in default under any of the
Company Leases, except where the existence of such defaults, individually or in
the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect, and each Company Lease is valid and binding and is enforceable by the
Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with its respective terms, except for
such failures to be valid, binding or enforceable, individually or in the
aggregate, is not reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse

individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All such tangible personal properties and
assets, other than properties and assets in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has a leasehold interest, are free and clear of all Liens, except
for such Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely
to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

            (a) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Material
Subsidiaries own, license, sublicense or otherwise possess legally enforceable

off-the-shelf software programs), the absence of which, individually or in the

all intellectual property, including without limitation, all (i) patents,
inventions, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, copyrights,
designs and trade secrets, (ii) applications for and registrations of such

confidential information and materials.

            (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation by the Company of the Merger will not result in the breach of,
or create on behalf of any third party the right to terminate or modify, or
result in the payment of any additional fees under, (i) any license, sublicense,
consent or other agreement relating to any Intellectual Property owned by the
Company that is material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, or (ii) any Intellectual Property Licenses (as defined below).
Section 3.11(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all registrations and applications for registration of
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries, and Section
3.11(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all licenses, sublicenses and other agreements as to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is authorized to use any third party Intellectual
Property that is material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, excluding non-exclusive, generally commercially available,
off-the-shelf software programs (collectively, "Intellectual Property
Licenses").

            (c) To the knowledge of the Company, all patents and registrations
for trademarks, service marks and copyrights which are held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and which are material to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are subsisting and have not expired or
been cancelled or abandoned. To the knowledge of the Company, no third party is
infringing, violating or misappropriating any of the Company Intellectual
Property, except for infringements, violations or misappropriations that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

            (d) To the knowledge of the Company, the conduct of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe,
violate or constitute a misappropriation of any Intellectual Property of any
third party, except for such infringements, violations and misappropriations
that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

            (e) The Company takes commercially reasonable steps to protect and
preserve its rights in any proprietary Intellectual Property (including
executing confidentiality, and intellectual property assignment agreements with
current executive officers and current employees and contractors that have a
material role in the development of the Company's products and Intellectual
Property).

rights that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is

                                      -20-
<PAGE>
reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no
material judgments, orders, settlements or decrees outstanding against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, no officer
or director of the Company is a defendant in any Action or, to the knowledge of
the Company, the subject of any investigation commenced by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the performance of his or her duties as an officer and/or

definitive agreements with respect to the financings contemplated by the
Commitment Letters on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Buyer in the
aggregate than the Commitment Letters and on such other terms and conditions as
shall be satisfactory to the Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable but in any
event at or prior to the Closing. The Buyer will furnish correct and complete
copies of such definitive agreements to the Company promptly upon their

            (b) At the Company's request, the Buyer shall keep the Company

terminated for

                                      -34-
<PAGE>
any reason or (ii) any financing source that is a party to any Commitment Letter

the Buyer on the material terms set forth therein. Other than in connection with
this Agreement, the Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates
to, without the prior written consent of the Company, take any action or enter
into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition, joint venture,
disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that would reasonably
be expected to impair, delay or prevent the Buyer's obtaining of the financing
contemplated by any Commitment Letter. The Buyer shall not amend or alter, or
agree to amend or alter, (i) the Equity Commitment Letter in any manner adverse
to the Company without the prior written consent of the Company or (ii) any Debt
Commitment Letter in any manner that would materially impair or delay or prevent
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Company.

manner materially adverse to the Buyer for any reason, the Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, and, if obtained, will provide the Company
with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for at least the same
amount of financing as such Commitment Letter as originally issued; provided
that the Buyer shall be under no obligation to obtain or seek to obtain any
financing commitment containing terms or funding conditions less favorable to
the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary than those included in such Commitment
Letter (in the Buyer's good faith and reasonable discretion).

            (d) The Company agrees to provide the Buyer with such cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of the financings contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer, including (i)
participation in meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions, management
presentation sessions, "road shows" and sessions with rating agencies, (ii)
using commercially reasonable efforts to prepare business projections and
financial statements (including pro forma financial statements), (iii) assisting
the Buyer in preparing offering memoranda, private placement memoranda and
similar documents, (iv) providing and executing documents as may reasonably be
requested by the Buyer, including a certificate or certificates of the chief
financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency and financial matters,
(v) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain surveys and title insurance
as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer, and (vi) reasonably facilitating
the pledge of collateral. The Company shall also use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause legal counsel to provide customary legal opinions and an
independent auditor of the Company to provide any unqualified opinions, consents
or customary comfort letters with respect to its financial statements. The
Company shall allow the Buyer's representatives the opportunity to review and
comment upon any such financial statements (including pro forma financial
statements) in draft form and to allow such representatives access to the
Company and supporting documentation with respect to the preparation of such
financial statements and the independent auditors' work papers relating to such
financial statements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) such requested
cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
incur any other liability in connection with the financings contemplated by the
Commitment Letters prior to the Effective Time (unless such fee or liability is
subject to the immediately succeeding sentence or

                                      -35-
<PAGE>
such commitment fee or liability is conditional on the occurrence of the
Effective Time). The Buyer shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. The
Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall, on a joint and several basis,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Representatives from and against
any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,

      6.1 No Solicitation.

            (a) No Solicitation or Negotiation. During the Pre-Closing Period,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall
cause its directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives (such directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, other advisors and
representatives, collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or
indirectly:

                  (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate
(including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer (including any proposal from or offer to the Company's
shareholders) with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal; or

                  (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public

Company may, prior to the adoption of the Company Voting Proposal only, to the
extent necessary for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations
under applicable law, as determined in good faith

                                      -36-
<PAGE>
by the Company Board after consultation with outside counsel, in response to a
bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (satisfying clause (i) of
the definition thereof) received by the Company after the date of this Agreement
that the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisor could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, in each case, so long as such Acquisition Proposal did not
result from a breach by the Company of this Section 6.1 and the Company has
complied with this Section 6.1, including Section 6.1(c), (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company to the person making such Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement not materially less restrictive of the other party than the
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
(including solicitation of a revised Acquisition Proposal) with such person and
its Representatives regarding any Acquisition Proposal, and (z) amend, or grant
a waiver or release under, any standstill or similar agreement with respect to
any Company Common Stock; provided, however, that the Company may only so amend
or so grant a waiver or release (i) to the extent that the Company has also
amended or granted a release or waiver under any standstill or similar agreement
affecting the Buyer and its Affiliates and (ii) to the extent necessary to
permit non-public proposals to be made to the Company Board.

            (b) No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition
Agreement. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company Board shall not:

                  (i) withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the
Buyer, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board with respect to the
Merger or the Company Voting Proposal;

                  (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into (or publicly
propose that the Company enter into) any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or other Contract (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or approve or recommend or propose to approve or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, understanding or arrangement relating
to any Acquisition Proposal (or resolve or authorize or propose to agree to do
any of the foregoing actions), except for a confidentiality agreement, waiver or
release referred to in Section 6.1(a) entered into in the circumstances referred
to in Section 6.1(a) and subject to the last sentence of Section 6.1(c); or

                  (iii) approve, recommend or take any position other than to
recommend rejection (including modifying any recommendation of rejection) of,
any Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may, prior to the adoption of the Company Voting Proposal only, to the
extent necessary for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations
under applicable law, as determined in good faith by the Company Board after
consultation with outside counsel, in response to a Superior Proposal received
by the Company Board after the date of this Agreement, (i) withhold, withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to the Buyer the Company Recommendation (as defined
below) (a "Change in the Company Recommendation") and/or (ii) terminate this

                                      -37-
<PAGE>
Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, but, in each case, only if:

                  (v)   such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach
                        by the Company of this Section 6.1;

                  (w)   the Company has complied with this Section 6.1,
                        including Section 6.1(c);

                  (x)   the Company Board shall have first provided prior
                        written notice to the Buyer that it is prepared to
                        effect a Change in the Company Recommendation in
                        response to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall
                        attach the most current version of any written agreement
                        relating to the transaction that constitutes such
                        Superior Proposal;

                  (y)   the Buyer does not make, within three Business Days
                        after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that the
                        Company Board determines in good faith, after
                        consultation with its financial adviser, is at least as
                        favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such
                        Superior Proposal; and

                  (z)   in the event of any termination of this Agreement by the
                        Company pursuant to the immediately preceding clause
                        (ii) of this paragraph, the Company pays the termination
                        fee under Section 8.3 concurrently with and as a
                        condition of such termination.

            The Company agrees that, during the three Business Day period prior
to effecting a Change in the Company Recommendation, the Company and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with the Buyer and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed by the Buyer.

            (c) Notices to the Buyer. The Company shall as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within 24 hours) provide oral and written notice
to the Buyer of receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the
person making any such Acquisition Proposal, and shall keep the Buyer reasonably
informed (in any event within 24 hours) of any material modifications or
material developments with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, including
without limitation, either copies of all written Acquisition Proposals,
including draft agreements or term sheets, or summaries of the material terms
thereof. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into a
confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing such information to the
Buyer.

            (d) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Section
6.1 or in Section 6.5 (or elsewhere in this Agreement) shall be deemed to
prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
with respect to a tender or exchange offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making

                                      -38-
<PAGE>
any required disclosure to the Company's stockholders if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such
action is necessary for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law; provided, however, that neither the Company
nor the Company Board (nor any committee thereof) shall (i) recommend that the
stockholders of the Company tender or exchange their shares of Company Common
Stock in connection with any such tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or (ii) withhold, withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Buyer the Company Board's recommendation with respect to the
Merger or the Company Voting Proposal, unless in each case the requirements of
this Section 6.1 shall have been satisfied.

            (e) Cessation of Ongoing Discussions. The Company shall, and shall
direct its Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and
negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any
proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal and shall request that all confidential information
previously furnished to any such third parties be promptly returned or
destroyed.

            (f) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

                  "Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any proposal or offer (A)
relating to a merger, reorganization, consolidation, dissolution, sale of
substantial assets, tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or other business combination
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) for the issuance by the
Company of 20% or more of its equity securities or (C) to acquire in any manner,
directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the capital stock or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis), in each case other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any written inquiry
with respect to, any oral inquiry to which the Company or its representatives
have responded with respect to, or any other oral inquiry that might reasonably
be expected to lead to, any proposal or offer described in the foregoing clause
(i), or (iii) any request for nonpublic information in connection with any
proposal, offer or inquiry described in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii), as
applicable.

                  "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide written
proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, 100% of the
equity securities or a substantial portion of the assets of the Company (which,
for purposes of this definition, shall mean an asset sale for net proceeds (less
any cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities included
in such asset sale) of more than $300,000,000), pursuant to a tender or exchange
offer, a merger, a consolidation or a sale of its assets, which the Company
Board determines in its good faith judgment to be (i) on terms more favorable to
the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after consultation with its
financial advisor), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any alteration to the terms of this
Agreement agreed to in writing by Buyer), (ii) reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory,
legal and other aspects of such proposal, and (iii) to the extent the Company

accompanied by one or more financing commitment letters or without a financing
condition.

acting through the Company Board, shall include in the Proxy Statement the
unanimous (of those directors that were present) recommendation of the Company
Board that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the Merger and the
adoption of this Agreement (the "Company Recommendation"). The Company shall
respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff and shall cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable time
after the resolution of any such comments. The Company shall notify the Buyer
promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and
shall supply the Buyer with copies of all correspondence between the Company or
any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any
other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all documents
that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities

requirements of law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Buyer or the Company, as the case may be,
shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with
the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to
stockholders of the Company, such amendment or supplement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not file with the SEC or mail to its stockholders
the Proxy Statement, any amendment thereto, any other soliciting material or any
such other documents without providing the Buyer a reasonable opportunity to

not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with business operations, to all of its
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records as the Buyer
shall request, and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the Buyer (x) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
laws and (y) all other information concerning its business, finances,
operations, properties, assets and personnel as the Buyer may reasonably
request. The Buyer will hold, and instruct all such accountants, counsel,
potential funding sources, placement agents, financing representatives and other
Representatives to hold, any such information that is nonpublic in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

      6.5 Stockholders Meeting. The Company, acting through the Company Board,
shall take all actions in accordance with applicable law, the Company Charter
Documents and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market to promptly and duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable the Company Meeting
for the purpose of considering and voting upon the Company Voting Proposal.
Subject to Section 6.1, (i) the Company Board shall recommend approval and

adverse to the Buyer, the Company Recommendation. Subject to Section 6.1, the

Voting Proposal and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company
required by the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market or the DGCL to obtain such
approval and adoption. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with the Buyer, may adjourn or
postpone the Company Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company's
stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Meeting.

      6.6 Legal Requirements.

            (a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.6(b), the

                  (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause

            (b) The Buyer and the Company agree, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their reasonable best efforts
to obtain any government clearances or approvals required for Closing under the
HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law,
regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively
"Antitrust Laws"), to respond to any government requests for information under
any Antitrust Law, and to contest and resist any action, including any
legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an "Antitrust Order") that restricts,
prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. The parties hereto will
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of
one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance,
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law.

            (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to

the United States Federal Trade Commission authorizes its staff to seek a
preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the
Merger.

      6.7 Public Disclosure. Prior to the Closing, the parties shall not issue
any report, statement or press release or otherwise make any public statements
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party, except as may
be required by law or the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market or in
connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, in which case the parties
will use their reasonable best efforts to reach mutual agreement as to the
language of any such report, statement or press release in advance of
publication. Any press release

                                      -42-
<PAGE>
announcing the execution of this Agreement or the Closing shall be issued only
in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Buyer, and
the Buyer and the Company shall consult with the other party before issuing any
other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the
Merger or this Agreement.

      6.8 Indemnification.

            (a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified
Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and
disbursements (collectively, "Costs"), incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL for officers and
directors of Delaware corporations. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled,
subject to applicable law, to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving
Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided
that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the
extent then required by the DGCL, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is made
against any Indemnified Party prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the provisions of this Section 6.8(a) shall continue in effect until the
final disposition thereof.

            (b) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently
set forth in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be
amended, modified or repealed for a period of six years time from the Effective
Time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were officers or directors
of the Company, unless such amendment, modification or repeal is required by
applicable law after the Effective Time.

            (c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and the Buyer shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries,
in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time insurance "tail" or other
insurance policies with respect to directors', officers' and fiduciaries'
liability insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the coverage applicable to
directors and officers as of the date hereof under the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy; provided that if such "tail" or other
policies are not available at a cost not greater than 200% of the annual
premiums paid as of the date hereof under such policy (the "Insurance Cap")
(which premium

                                      -43-
<PAGE>
the Company hereby represents and warrants is as set forth on Section 6.8(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule), then the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under substantially similar
policies for such annual premiums as do not exceed the Insurance Cap.

            (d) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section
6.8 in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this
Section 6.8; provided that the Indemnified Party must provide an undertaking to
repay all expenses if it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification.

            (e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be in
addition to the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors
of the Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties, their heirs and their representatives.

            (f) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, then proper provision shall be made so that the surviving corporation or
entity in such transaction shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.8.

            (g) The Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all
of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.8.

      6.9 Notification of Certain Matters. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt
notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event,
which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from and
after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any material
failure of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary or the Company, as the case
may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such
party's obligation to consummate the Merger.

      6.10 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Common Stock) under such rule
and result from the transactions contemplated by Articles I and II of this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

      6.11 Employee Compensation. For a six month period following the Effective
Time, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the severance
plan established by the Company for its employees and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide generally to those of its employees and employees
of the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries who shall have
been employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees"), a total compensation package
(including benefits but not including equity awards) that, in the aggregate, is
no less favorable to the total compensation package (including benefits but not
including equity awards) provided to those employees immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement.

      6.12 Accrued Personal, Sick or Vacation Time. With respect to any accrued
but unused personal, sick or vacation time to which any Continuing Employee is
entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "PSV
Policies"), such Continuing Employee shall be allowed to use such accrued
personal, sick or vacation time; provided, however, that if the Buyer deems it
necessary to disallow any such Continuing Employee from taking such accrued
personal, sick or vacation time, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to pay in cash to each such Continuing Employee an amount equal to such
personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the terms of the PSV Policies
in effect as of the date hereof; and provided, further, that the Buyer shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay in cash an amount equal to such accrued
personal, sick and vacation time to any Continuing Employees whose employment
terminates for any reason subsequent to the Effective Time. For purposes of this
Section 6.12, the term "personal time" shall include the sabbatical benefits
provided by the Company.

      6.13 Service Credit. Following the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to give each Continuing Employee full credit for prior
service with the Company or its Subsidiaries (and to the extent credited by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, with any prior employer) for purposes of (a)
eligibility and vesting under any Surviving Corporation Employee Plans (as
defined below) and (b) determination of benefit levels under any Surviving
Corporation Employee Plan or policy relating to vacation or severance, in each
case for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the
Continuing Employee is offered participation, but except where such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, the Buyer shall waive, or
cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing
conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable
plan of the Surviving Corporation and recognize for purposes of annual
deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Surviving Corporation Employee Plan" means, to the extent
applicable, any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA), any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA), and any other written or oral plan, agreement or arrangement providing
insurance coverage, severance benefits, disability benefits, or vacation pay,
for the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employee of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or any entity which is a member
of (A) a controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the
Code), (B) a group of trades or businesses under common control (as defined in
Section 414(c) of the Code) or (C) an

                                      -45-
<PAGE>
affiliated service group (as defined in Section 414(m) of the Code or the
regulations under Section 414(o) of the Code), any of which includes or included
the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation.

      6.14 No Benefit to Third Party. Except as set forth in Section 6.8,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
current or former employee, director or consultant any rights, remedies or
obligations under or by reason of this Agreement, including, without limitation,
this Article VI.

      6.15 Resignations. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain and deliver to the Buyer at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Buyer of the resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, of all
directors of the Company (except those designated by the Buyer to the Company in
writing at least 20 calendar days prior to the Closing).

<PAGE>
(b) the provisions of Sections 5.2 (Confidentiality) and 8.3 (Fees and

in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

      8.3 Fees and Expenses.

            (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses

not the Merger is consummated.

Company Voting Proposal any Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
disclosed, and (B) within 12 months after any such termination, the Company
consummates, recommends to its stockholders or becomes a party to any

for purposes of this Section 8.3(b), the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.1(f), except that references to
"20% or more" shall be deemed to be references to "50% or more."

            Any fee due under this Section 8.3(b) shall be paid to the Buyer by
wire transfer of same-day funds: (x) if such fee is payable in the event of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(f), concurrently with and as a condition to

is otherwise the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in connection with any
termination of this Agreement on the bases specified in Section 8.3(b).

            (d) The Company shall pay all expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by the Buyer in connection with its

adjudicating the matter, not to have any right to receive any amounts from the
Company under this Section 8.3.

      8.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger
by the stockholders of any party, but, after any such approval, no amendment
shall be made which by law requires further approval by such stockholders
without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

      8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if

or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy
in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or
condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the
extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights.

      9.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties to
this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral,
with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that the Confidentiality

      9.4 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 6.8 (with
respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries),
this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to (i) confer any
rights or remedies upon any person other than the

                                      -52-
<PAGE>
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii)
create any agreement of employment with any person or (iii) otherwise create any
third-party beneficiary hereto.

      9.5 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the
prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without such
prior written consent shall be null and void; provided that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Buyer may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any
Affiliate without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto;
provided further that no such assignment shall relieve the Buyer of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

      9.6 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity, legality or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal and enforceable
and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid, legal and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and
other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term.

      9.7 Counterparts and Signature. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.

      9.8 Interpretation. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever the
context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all

                                      -53-
<PAGE>
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

      9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect
to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of
any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

      9.10 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

      9.11 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
