effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation at and after the Effective Time
until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof and the GBCC,
provided that at the Effective Time such Articles of Incorporation shall be

ARTICLE III



CONVERSION OF SHARES



3.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any capital stock
described below:



(a) All shares of Common Stock of Stone, par value $.01 per share (" _Stone
Shares_ "), that are held in Stones treasury shall be canceled and cease to
exist and no cash, shares of Waves common stock, no par value (the " _Wave
Common Shares_ "), or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.



(b) Each issued and outstanding Stone Share (other than Stone Shares
treated in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_ ) shall be converted into the
right to receive one (such one-for-one ratio, the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") Wave
Common Share (the " _Stock Consideration_ "). All such Stone Shares, when so
converted, shall automatically be retired, shall cease to be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled, and the holder of a certificate (" _Stock
Certificate_ ") that,



 

2 immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented Stone Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon
the surrender of such Stock Certificate in accordance with _Section 3.2_ : (i)
the applicable Stock Consideration, and (ii) certain dividends and other
distributions under _Section 3.1(d)_ , in each case without interest
(collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if between the date hereof and the Effective Time the Wave Common Shares or
Stone Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, because of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio
shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares.



(c) The Merger shall not affect any Wave Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any un-surrendered Stock Certificate with respect to the applicable
Merger Consideration represented thereby until the holder of record of such
Stock Certificate has surrendered such Stock Certificate in accordance with
_Section 3.2_. Subject to the effect of applicable laws (including escheat
and abandoned property laws), following surrender of any such Stock
Certificate, the record holder of the certificate or certificates representing
the Merger Consideration issued in exchange therefor shall be paid without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to Merger
Consideration, and (ii) if the payment date for any dividend or distribution
payable with respect to Merger Consideration has not occurred prior to the
surrender of such Stock Certificate, at the appropriate payment date therefor,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to the surrender of such Stock Certificate and a
payment date subsequent to the surrender of such Stock Certificate.



(e) All Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender of Stock Certificates
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Stock Certificates and
the Stone Shares formerly represented thereby, and from and after the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers effected on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Stone Shares which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_ARTICLE III_.



3.2  _Surrender and Payment_.



(a) Wave shall authorize one or more transfer agent(s) reasonably acceptable
to Stone to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") with
respect to the Merger. At or prior to the Effective Time, Wave shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Stone Shares, for
exchange in accordance with this _Section 3.2_ through the Exchange Agent, the
aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable in connection with the Merger
(collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, deliver the applicable Merger Consideration in
exchange for surrendered Stock Certificates pursuant to _Section 3.1_ out of
the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by _Section 3.2(d)_ , the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.



 

3 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Wave shall cause the Exchange Agent to
send to each holder of record of Stock Certificates a letter of transmittal
for use in such exchange (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title with respect to the Stock Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Stock Certificates to the
Exchange Agent), and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Stock
Certificates for payment therefor in accordance herewith (together, the "
_Exchange Instructions_ "). The Exchange Agent shall also provide for holders
of Stock Certificates to procure in person immediately after the Effective
Time a letter of transmittal and instructions and to deliver in person
immediately after the Effective Time such letter of transmittal and Stock
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.



(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Stone Shares represented by the Stock
Certificate(s) surrendered in exchange therefor, no such issuance or payment
shall be made unless (i) the Stock Certificate(s) so surrendered have been
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the
Person requesting such issuance has paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer or
other taxes required as a result of such issuance to a Person other than the
registered holder or establish to the Exchange Agents satisfaction that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Person_ " means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a
partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity or organization,
including any governmental or regulatory authority or agency (a "
_Governmental Authority_ "). 



(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Stone Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Wave, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such holders Stock
Certificates in accordance with this _Section 3.2_ prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Wave, as a general creditor thereof, to
exchange such Stock Certificates or to pay amounts to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1_. If outstanding Stock Certificates are not
surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or, in any
particular case, prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration
issuable or payable upon the surrender of such Stock Certificates would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or
agency), the Merger Consideration issuable or payable upon the surrender of
such Stock Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of Wave, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Wave, Stone, or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of
Stock Certificates for any amount paid, or Merger Consideration delivered, to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.



(e) If any Stock Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock Certificate is
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Wave may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.



 

4 3.3 _Stock Plans; Convertible Securities_.



(a) At the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, Wave will assume each outstanding employee or
director stock option of Stone (the " _Stone Options_ "), and it will become
an option (i) to purchase that number of Wave Common Shares obtained by
multiplying the number of Stone Shares issuable upon the exercise of such
Stone Option by the Exchange Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price per share equal
to the per share exercise price of such Stone Option divided by the Exchange
Ratio, and (iii) otherwise upon the same terms and conditions as such
outstanding Stone Options; except that if Code Section 421 applies to any
Stone Option because of the qualifications under Code Section 422 or 423, the
exercise price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such Stone
Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Stone Option will
comply with Code Section 424(a).



(b) Wave will take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of Wave Common Shares for delivery upon exercise of
Stone Options Wave assumes under _Section 3.3(a)_.



(c) On or prior to the 30th day following the Effective Time, Wave will file
a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms) with respect to the Wave Common Shares subject to the Stone Options and
will use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for as long as such options remain
outstanding.



(d) Wave will assume as of the Effective Time each Stone stock option plan
providing for the issuance or grant of Stone Options and all of Stones
obligations with respect to the Stone Options. Upon assumption of such plans,
such amendments thereto as may be required to reflect the Merger will be
deemed to have been made.



(e) At the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, each outstanding employee or director stock option
of Wave (the "Wave Options"), and each Wave stock option plan providing for
the issuance and grant of Wave Options, shall continue in effect upon the same
terms and conditions as existed immediately prior to the Effective Time.



3.4 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Transactions_ ") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., Austin, Texas time, on the business day (the " _Closing Date_ ")
on which all of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VIII_ are satisfied or
waived, at the offices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP, 300 West Sixth
Street, Suite 2100, Austin, Texas 78701, or at such other date and time as
Wave and Stone shall agree.

the SEC since January 1, 2001 under the Securities Act or the Exchange

file a Current Report on Form 8-K other than the execution of this Agreement.
All documents required to be filed by Stone with the SEC have been filed with
the SEC.



(b) The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Stone have

9 rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, and the statements contained in
any such certifications are complete and correct; neither Stone nor its
officers has received notice from any Governmental Authority questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission

adversely affect such qualification or exemption; (ii) each such plan has

(d) by Wave, if there has been a material breach by Stone of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement which breach (if susceptible to cure) has not been cured in all
material respects within 20 business days following receipt by Stone of
written notice of such breach (a " _Stone Breach_ ");



(e) by either Stone or Wave, if there shall be any applicable law, rule or
regulation that makes consummation of the Merger illegal or if any judgment,
injunction, order or decree of a court or other Governmental Authority of

and such judgment, injunction, order or decree becomes final and
nonappealable;



(f) by either Stone or Wave, if either of the stockholder approvals referred

Shares than the Transactions; provided, however, that Stone may not terminate
this Agreement under this  _Section 10.1(h)_ unless it has used all
reasonable efforts to provide Wave with two business days prior written notice
of its intent to so terminate this Agreement together with a detailed summary
of the terms



 

53 and conditions of such Stone Acquisition Proposal; provided further, that
prior to any such termination, Stone shall, and shall cause its respective
financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with Wave to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
Stone to proceed with the Transactions;



(i) by Stone, if (i) Waves Board of Directors withdraws, modifies or changes
its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in a manner adverse to
Stone or resolves to do any of the foregoing or Waves Board of Directors
recommends to Waves stockholders any Wave Acquisition Proposal or resolves to
do so; or (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares of
capital stock of Wave then representing 40% or more of the combined power to
vote generally for the election of directors is commenced, and Waves Board of
Directors does not, within the applicable period required by law, recommend
that stockholders not tender their shares into such tender or exchange offer;



(j) by Wave or Stone, if Wave accepts a Wave Superior Proposal. For this
Agreement, " _Wave Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Wave
Acquisition Proposal that (i) Waves Board of Directors in good faith
determines, after consultation with its financial advisors and its outside
legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be consummated taking into account the
Person making such Wave Acquisition Proposal and all legal, financial,
regulatory and other relevant aspects of such Wave Acquisition Proposal, and
Waves Board of Directors in good faith determines, after consultation with
its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel, that such Wave
Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is
more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Wave Common
Shares than the Transactions; provided, however, that Wave may not terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(j)_ unless it has used all reasonable
efforts to provide Stone with two business days prior written notice of its
intent to so terminate this Agreement together with a detailed summary of the
terms and conditions of such Wave Acquisition Proposal; provided further, that
prior to any such termination, Wave shall, and shall cause its respective
financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with Stone to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable Wave to proceed with the Transactions;



(k) by Stone, if the average of the closing prices per share of a Wave Common
Share on the Nasdaq National Market, as reported in The Wall Street
Journal, for the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the third
trading day before Closing is less than $4.92;



(l) by Wave, if the average of the closing prices per share of a Stone Share
on the Nasdaq National Market, as reported in the Wall Street Journal,
for the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the third trading
day before Closing is less than $4.05.



 

54 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and the Merger
is abandoned under this  _ARTICLE X_ , all obligations of the parties shall
terminate, except for _Sections 7.5_ , _7.7_ , _11.2_ , _11.3_ , _11.7_ ,
_11.8_ , and the last two sentences of _Section 7.1_ , provided that nothing

11.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto and the certificates, documents, instruments and writings
that are delivered pursuant hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties in respect of the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among
the parties, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the
subject matter hereof.



11.3 _Assignment; Binding Effect; Third Party Beneficiaries_. No party may
assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations
hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties. All of the
terms, agreements, covenants, representations, warranties and conditions of
this Agreement are binding upon, and inure to the benefit of and are
enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. There are no third party beneficiaries having rights under or with
respect to this Agreement.



11.4 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement will be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will
not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof;
provided that if any provision of this Agreement, as applied to any party or
to any circumstance, is judicially determined not to be enforceable in
accordance with its terms, the parties agree that the court judicially making
such determination may modify the provision in a manner consistent with its
objectives such that it is enforceable, and/or to delete specific words or
phrases, and in its modified form, such provision will then be enforceable and
will be enforced.



11.5 _Interpretation_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.



 

56 11.6 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement will
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties, which delivery may be made by
exchange of copies of the signature page by facsimile transmission. For
purposes of determining whether a party has signed this Agreement or any
document contemplated hereby or any amendment or waiver hereof, only
a handwritten signature on a paper document or a facsimile transmission of a
handwritten original signature will constitute a signature, notwithstanding
any law relating to or enabling the creation, execution or delivery of any
contract or signature by electronic means.



11.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted, and
governed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, without
reference to rules relating to conflicts of law.



11.8 _Attorneys  Fees_. If any action at law or equity, including an action
for declaratory relief, is brought to enforce or interpret any provision of
this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses from the other party, which fees and expenses
shall be in addition to any other relief which may be awarded.



11.9 _Disclosure Schedules_. The disclosures made on any disclosure schedule,
including the Stone Disclosure Schedule and the Wave Disclosure Schedule, with
respect to any representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made with
respect to any other representation or warranty requiring the same or
similar disclosure to the extent that the relevance of such disclosure to
other representations and warranties is reasonably evident from the face of
the disclosure schedule. The inclusion of any matter on any disclosure
schedule will not be deemed an admission by any party that such listed matter
is material or that such listed matter has or would have a Stone Material
Adverse Effect or a Wave Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.



11.10 _Amendments and Supplements_. At any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the respective
stockholders of Wave and Stone and prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement
may be amended or supplemented in writing by Wave and Stone with respect to
any of the terms contained in this Agreement, except as otherwise provided by
law; provided, however, that following approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders of Wave or Stone, as applicable, there shall be no amendment or
change to the provisions hereof unless permitted by the DGCL without further
approval by the stockholders of Wave or Stone, as applicable.



11.11  _Construction_. Any reference to any law will be deemed also to refer
to such law as amended and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
unless the context requires otherwise. The article and section headings
contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and will not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The words
"include," "includes," and "including" will be deemed to be followed by
"without limitation." Pronouns in masculine, feminine, and neuter genders
will be construed to include any other gender, and words in the singular form
will be construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless the context
otherwise requires. The words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereof," "hereby,"
"hereunder," and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to



 

57 any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited. The parties intend
that each representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein will have
independent significance. If any party has breached any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the
party has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, or covenant. Time is
of the essence in the performance of this Agreement.



11.12  _Extensions, Waivers, Etc_. Any party may, for itself only, (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations of any other party
under this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of any other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a writing signed by the party to
be bound thereby. No waiver by any party of any default, misrepresentation or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, may be
deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising because of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. Neither the
failure nor any delay on the part of any party to exercise any right or
remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or
further exercise of the same or of any other right or remedy.
