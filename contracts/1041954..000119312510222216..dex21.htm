2 ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of the Company s Capital Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any shares of capital stock of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

 

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub s Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Parent-Owned Stock and Company-Owned
Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(" _Company Common Stock_ ") owned by the Company or any of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries or by Parent or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately
before the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Excluded Shares_ ")
shall be cancelled automatically and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be paid for those Company Excluded Shares.

 

(c) _Cancellation and Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time, other than any Company Excluded Shares or shares
as to which appraisal rights are perfected pursuant to Section 2.4, shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to $3.00 (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(ii) All shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted pursuant to
Section 2.1(c)(i) shall be cancelled automatically and shall cease to exist,
and the holders of certificates (" _Old Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares
(" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which immediately before the Effective Time
represented those shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to those
shares, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of their Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
Section 2.2.

 

Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates; Book-Entry Shares_

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Before the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) select a bank
or trust company, who must be satisfactory to the Company in its reasonable
discretion, to act as the paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
and

  

 

3  (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent, the terms
and conditions of which must be satisfactory to the Company in its reasonable
discretion. Parent shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of the
Paying Agent.

(b) _Payment Fund_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent an amount of cash (the "
_Payment Fund_ ") sufficient to deliver to the stockholders of the Company the
aggregate Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company are
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i). At the time of such
deposit, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall irrevocably instruct the
Paying Agent to deliver such aggregate Merger Consideration to the
stockholders of the Company in accordance with the procedures of the Paying
Agent referred to in Section 2.2(c).

(c) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable but in no event later
than two Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a share of Company Common
Stock converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i), (x) a letter of transmittal in
customary form, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to such holders shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Old
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (y) instructions for
surrendering such Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(ii) _Surrender of Certificates_. Upon surrender of an Old Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by
the Paying Agent, the holder of that Old Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive, and the Paying Agent shall pay in
exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number
of shares formerly evidenced by that Old Certificate or Book-Entry Shares less
any required withholding of Taxes. Any Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
so surrendered shall be cancelled immediately. No interest shall accrue or be
paid on any amount payable upon surrender of Old Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

 

(iii) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Old Certificate
is registered, then the Merger Consideration may be paid to such a transferee
so long as (A) the surrendered Old Certificate is accompanied by all documents
reasonably required by Parent to evidence and effect that transfer and (B)
the Person requesting such payment (1) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or
(2) establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent
that any such Taxes have already been paid or are not applicable.

(iv) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section
2.2(c), each Old Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger

  

 

4  Consideration. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of any Old
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to that Old Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares and the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Old Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Old Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such
affidavit claiming such Old Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Merger Consideration to such Person in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Old Certificate.

 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time.

 

(f) _Required Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended from time to time (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld
and paid to the appropriate taxing authorities, those amounts shall be treated
as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
or withholding was made for all purposes under this Agreement.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Old Certificates for any amount
properly paid to a public official under any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment
Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investment shall be in
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a State of the United
States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual funds investing in
such assets. Any such investment shall be for the benefit, and at the risk, of
Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such investment shall
be for the benefit of Parent; _provided_ , that no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to former stockholders
of the Company, and Parent shall promptly provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation promptly to provide, additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the former stockholders of the Company in the amount
of any such losses to the extent necessary to satisfy the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Article II.

 



 

5 (i) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent
upon demand. Thereafter, any holder of Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
who has not complied with this Article II shall look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration.

Section 2.3 _Company Options and Company Stock Awards_.

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts so that, as of the Effective
Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock awarded under the
Company Stock Incentive Plans (each, a " _Company Option_ ") that is
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, whether or not vested and
exercisable, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company Option, shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
payable at the Effective Time that is equal to the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the per share exercise or purchase price of the
applicable Company Option (the " _Exercise Price_ ") multiplied by the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock in respect of such Company Option
immediately before the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
Exercise Price of a Company Option is equal to or exceeds the value of the
Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled and terminated
at the Effective Time without payment or consideration therefor and the holder
of such Company Option shall have no rights whatsoever with respect thereto.

 

(b) The Company has obtained the requisite irrevocable consents so that, as of
the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units that represents the
right to acquire shares of Common Stock awarded under the Company Stock
Incentive Plans (each, a " _Company Stock Award_ ") that is subject to
performance-based vesting criteria (each, a " _Performance-Based Company
Stock Award_ ") outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, whether or
not then exercisable or vested, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company Stock
Award, shall be cancelled and terminated at the Effective Time without
payment or consideration therefor and each holder of a Performance-Based
Company Stock Award shall have no rights whatsoever with respect thereto. Each
Performance-Based Company Stock Award is identified in Section 2.3(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

(c) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts so that, as of the
Effective Time,

(i) each Company Stock Award that is (A) subject to time-based
vesting criteria (each, a " _Time-Based Company Stock Award_ "), (B) held by
a Non-Continuing Employee and (C) (x) outstanding and unvested or (y)
outstanding, vested and not yet delivered, in each case, immediately
before the Effective Time,



 

6 (ii) each Time-Based Company Stock Award that is held by a Continuing Employee
listed on Section 2.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a "
_Specified Employee_ ") to the extent that such award represents outstanding,
vested and not yet delivered shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and

(iii) each Time-Based Company Stock Award that is held by a Specified Employee
to the extent that such award represents 50% of the outstanding and unvested
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award immediately before the
Effective Time,

by virtue of the Merger and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder of each such Company Stock Award, shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
payable at the Effective Time that is equal to the Merger Consideration
multiplied by (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Time-Based Company Stock Award, in the case of Time-Based Company Stock Awards
described in Section 2.3(c)(i), (2) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock described in Section 2.3(c)(ii) with respect to an award described in
Section 2.3(c)(ii) and (3) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
described in Section 2.3(c)(iii) with respect to an award described in
Section 2.3(c)(iii), as applicable.

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts so that,
as of the Effective Time, each Time-Based Company Stock Award (to the extent
that it is not cancelled in accordance with Section 2.3(c) of this Agreement)
that is (x) outstanding and unvested or (y) outstanding, vested and not yet
delivered, in each case, immediately before the Effective Time and held by a
Continuing Employee, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Time-Based Company
Stock Award, be assumed by Parent and converted into a restricted stock unit
that represents the right to acquire a number of validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Time-Based
Company Stock Award, _multiplied by_ (y) the Conversion Ratio (each a "
_Converted Stock Award_ "); _provided_ , that any fractional share resulting
from such multiplication shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole
share. Following the Effective Time, each Converted Stock Award shall continue
to be governed by the same terms and conditions, including the vesting
schedule, as were applicable to the applicable Time-Based Company Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including terms contained in the
Company Stock Incentive Plans and any stock unit award agreement, as
appropriate; _provided_ ,  _however_ that if the employment of a Continuing
Employee who becomes a holder of a Converted Stock Award pursuant to this
Section 2.3(d) is terminated for any reason other than for Cause (as defined
in the applicable stock unit award agreement) or other than for Poor
Performance (as defined below) by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates while any

 



 

7  portion of such Converted Stock Award is unvested then, notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement, the Company Stock Incentive Plans, or otherwise
to the contrary, any portion of such Converted Stock Award that is unvested
on the date of such termination of employment shall immediately become vested
and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall remain payable in accordance with the
stock unit award agreement applicable thereto. For purposes of this Section
2.3(d), a termination for Poor Performance means a termination of employment
for poor performance on the job after due notice and time to cure in
accordance with Parents standard policies and practices for Parents
employees for terminations for poor performance on the job. As used in this
Agreement, " _Conversion Ratio_ " means a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the Merger Consideration and the denominator of which shall be the
average closing price per share of Parent Common Stock for the twenty (20)
consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the second trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as reported by Bloomberg LP for each
such trading day, or, if not reported by Bloomberg LP, any other
authoritative source reasonably selected and agreed upon in writing by Parent
and the Company).

 

(e) The adjustments provided for in Section 2.3(e) with respect to any Time-
Based Company Stock Award shall be and are intended to be effected in a
manner which is consistent with Section 409A of the Code. The Company shall
ensure that following the Effective Time, no holder of a Converted Stock Award
or any participant in the Company Stock Incentive Plans shall have any right
to receive shares of Company Common Stock following the Effective Time or any
other equity interest therein.

(f) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need of
any further corporate action, Parent shall assume the Converted Stock Awards
in accordance with the terms set forth in this Section 2.3, and shall assume
the Company Stock Incentive Plans. On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall take all corporate action necessary to (i) reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of the Converted Stock Awards and (ii) otherwise effect the provisions of
this Section 2.3. Not later than the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to the Converted Stock Awards. Such registration
statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus
or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained) at least for so long as
any Converted Stock Awards may remain outstanding.

 

(g) Any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.3 in respect of the Company
Options or Company Stock Awards, as applicable, shall be reduced by any
income or employment Tax withholding required under (i) the Code, (ii) any
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law, and (iii) any other applicable
Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld and paid to the
appropriate taxing authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having been
paid to the holder of that Company Option or Company Stock Award, as
applicable, for all purposes under this Agreement.

 



 

8 (h) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall mail to
each holder of Company Options and Company Stock Awards a letter describing
the treatment of and payment for such Company Options or Company Stock Awards
pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing instructions for use in obtaining
payment for such Company Options or Company Stock Awards, to the extent
applicable. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, at all
times from and after the Effective Time maintain sufficient liquid funds to
satisfy their obligations to holders of Company Options and Company Stock
Awards pursuant to this Section 2.3.

Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Common Stock for which the holder thereof (i) has not voted
in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and
(ii) has demanded the appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and has
complied in all respects with, Delaware Law (collectively, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(c)(i). At the Effective Time, (A)
all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and (B) the
holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be
granted to them under Delaware Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then that
holders shares (i) shall be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares and (ii)
shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the
Old Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such shares in
accordance with Section 2.2.

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, the withdrawals of such
demands and any other instrument relating to appraisal served on the Company
under Delaware Law and (ii) the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal. Except to the extent
required by applicable Law, the Company shall not offer to make or make any
payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal without the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

Section 2.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse split), stock-based
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, combination,
issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar

 



 

9  transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to
provide to the stockholders of the Company the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such reclassification, split,
dividend, distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, combination,
tender or exchange or similar transaction.

circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading. No
Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act or is otherwise required to file any periodic forms,

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
controls (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the

Actions_ ") pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or prevent or materially impair or materially delay the ability of
the Company to perform its obligations hereunder. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no Orders outstanding against the Company or any of

to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (ii) after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y)
below with respect to such Takeover Proposal would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, on or prior to 11:59
p.m. (New York City time) on the 30th day following the date of this Agreement
(after which time the Company and its Representatives shall cease
immediately any actions described in clauses (x) and (y) below) the Company

Section 5.4, and after giving prior written notice to Parent: (x) furnish
access and information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , that such
information has previously been made available to Parent or is made available
to Parent substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person, and the Person receiving such access and information is subject to
confidentiality restrictions substantially similar to those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; and (y) participate in discussions and
negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, as promptly
as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 24 hours of receipt of such
Takeover Proposal or inquiry), notify Parent orally and in writing of the
receipt of any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the Person
making such Takeover Proposal or inquiry, and the Company shall, as promptly
as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 24 hours of receipt of such
Takeover Proposal or inquiry), provide to Parent a copy of all written
proposals provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, notify Parent in writing of any material modifications
to the financial or other material terms of such Takeover Proposal or inquiry
and shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 24
hours of receipt of such Takeover Proposal or inquiry), provide to Parent a
copy of all written proposals subsequently provided to or by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any such Takeover Proposal or
inquiry.



 

38 (c) Except as set forth in Section 5.4(d), the Company Board shall not,
directly or indirectly (i) approve, endorse or recommend a Takeover Proposal,
(ii) approve, recommend or allow the Company to enter into a Contract relating
to a Takeover Proposal or (iii) effect any transaction contemplated by any
Takeover Proposal.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
Board may on or prior to 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the 30th day
following the date of this Agreement, terminate this Agreement in response to
a Superior Proposal that developed from a Takeover Proposal, which Takeover
Proposal was received by the Company Board on or prior to 11:59 p.m. (New
York City time) on the 15th day following the date of this Agreement, but, in
each case, only if:

(i) such Superior Proposal did not result, directly or indirectly, from a
breach by the Company of this Section 5.4 or Section 4.3 of the Voting
Agreement;

 

(ii) the Company Board has concluded in good faith, following consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that its failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

(iii) the Company shall have provided written notice to Parent at least three
days in advance that it is prepared to terminate this Agreement, which notice
shall specify the basis therefor and attach the most current version of any
Contract relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal,
the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and any other
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal;

 

(iv) Parent does not make, within three days after the receipt of such notice
(it being understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal, shall require an additional prior
written notice to Parent and a new three day period), a binding, written and
complete (including any schedules or exhibits) proposal that the
Company Board determines in good faith would permit the Company Board not to
terminate this Agreement; and

(v) before or concurrently with any termination in accordance with this
Section 5.4(d), the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 7.6.

 

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the
Company Board or any committee thereof from complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a Takeover
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to stockholders), or making any "stop-look-and-
listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to
the stockholders of the Company).



 

39 Section 5.5 _Information Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a written
information statement containing the information specified in Schedule 14C
under the Exchange Act and concerning the Written Consent, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Information Statement_ "). The Company shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Information Statement
prior to filing. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and after consultation with the Parent) to respond to
any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Information Statement. The
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any responses to comments from the SEC on the Information
Statement or any amendments or supplements to the Information Statement prior
to the filing of such responses, amendments or supplements. The Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Information Statement to be mailed
to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable
after (i) confirmation from the SEC that it has no further comments on the
Information Statement or (ii) confirmation from the SEC that the Information
Statement is otherwise not to be reviewed.

(b) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the Company in
the preparation of the Information Statement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company
the information relating to it and its Affiliates required by the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the
Information Statement or that is customarily included in information
statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

(c) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates is discovered by
Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to any of the Information Statement so that such document would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party discovering this
information shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify the other
parties to this Agreement and, to the extent required by Law, Parent and the
Company shall cause an appropriate amendment or supplement describing this
information, as promptly as reasonably practicable, to be filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.

Section 5.6 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) For the period which starts on the Closing Date and ends on December 31,
2011 (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to, provide to the individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time
are employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and also are
Continuing Employees, with



 

40  compensation and benefits, including severance payments and benefits, that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
provided to such Continuing Employees by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, but subject to applicable Law and any contractual
rights of any Continuing Employee, after the Effective Time nothing herein
shall preclude the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of
any Continuing Employee for any reason.

 

(b) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, honor all employment,
severance, change of control and similar Contracts listed on Section 5.6(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter in effect with Continuing Employees in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to any amendment that is necessary to comply with
applicable Law.

(c) For purposes of eligibility, level of benefits (excluding accruals under
a defined benefit plan) and vesting under all employee benefit plans of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after the Effective Time (the "
_New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall receive full credit for such
Continuing Employees years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
before the Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any
other entities for which the Company and its Subsidiaries have given credit
for prior service), to the same extent as such Continuing Employee received,
prior to the Effective Time, credit for such service under any corresponding
Company Benefit Plan (except to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of service). For purposes of the
New Plans providing medical, dental, prescription drug, vision, life insurance
or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall cause the New
Plans to (a) waive all pre-existing condition exclusions with respect to
Continuing Employees and their dependents to the same extent such exclusions
were waived or satisfied under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which
they participated immediately before participating in the New Plan and (b)
take into account all eligible expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Company Benefit Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(d) Parent, after the Closing Date, intends to provide equity participation
(in addition to any provided under Section 2.3(d)) and other incentive
compensation opportunities to Continuing Employees who are key employees.

(e) If the Closing Date occurs in calendar year 2011, then on or prior to the
Closing Date the Company may pay to each employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company who is eligible for a bonus under the Companys
2010 



 

41  Management Incentive Compensation Plan as in effect on the date of this
Agreement (the " _MICP_ ") the bonus, if any, which he or she shall have
earned for 2010 pursuant to the terms of such plan as determined consistent
with past practice, and the Company may pay an annual bonus for 2010 to any
other employee but only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice.
If the Closing Date occurs in calendar year 2010, then on or prior to the
Closing Date the Company may pay to each employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company who is eligible for a bonus under the MICP the
bonus, if any, he or she would have earned for 2010 pursuant to the terms of
such plan based on the Companys performance versus target through the end of
the month immediately preceding the Closing Date as determined consistent with
past practice, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator which shall be the
number of days (including the Closing Date) that has occurred in 2010 as of
the Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be 365, and the Company
may pay an annual bonus to any other employee for 2010 but any such bonus
shall be determined in a manner consistent with past practice after taking
into account the fact that the bonus will be for a period of less than one
year.

 

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.6, whether express or implied, shall confer upon
any current or former employee of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any rights
or remedies whatsoever, including any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under
or by reason of this Section 5.6. No provision of this Section 5.6 is
intended to modify, amend or create any employee benefit plan of the Company,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates. 

Section 5.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, cause
all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now
existing in favor of any present or former director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and the fiduciaries of any Company Benefit Plans
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company Organizational
Documents, the resolutions of the Company Board or any committee of the
Company Board, in the comparable organizational document of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, the resolutions of the boards of directors, or any
committee of the boards of directors or comparable governing bodies of any of
the Subsidiaries of the Company, in agreements between an Indemnified Party
and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or otherwise in effect on the date
of this Agreement, to survive the Merger and to continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time or, if
longer, for such period as is set forth in any applicable Contract with an
Indemnified Party in effect on the date of this Agreement, and, with respect
to any Legal Action commenced during either such period, until the final
disposition of such Legal Action.

 

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify all Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or
relating to their services as



 

42  directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of
the Company Benefit Plans, whether asserted or claimed at or after or
occurring before the Effective Time (including in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement). If any Indemnified
Party is or becomes involved in any Legal Action in connection with
any matter subject to indemnification under this Agreement, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, advance as incurred any
costs or expenses (including legal fees and disbursements), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or Liabilities (" _Damages_ ") out of or incurred in
connection with such Legal Action, subject to Parents or the Surviving
Corporations, as applicable, receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such Indemnified Party, if required by the DGCL, to repay such Damages if it
is ultimately determined under applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to be indemnified.

 

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
maintain in effect for at least six years after the Effective Time the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the directors
and officers of the Company with respect to claims arising out of or relating
to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) so long as Parent and the Surviving Corporation are not required to
pay an annual premium in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance before the date of this Agreement (such 200%
amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If Parent and the Surviving
Corporation are unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior sentence
for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, instead obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the arrangements
contemplated by this Section 5.7(c), the Company shall be entitled to
purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy covering
the matters described in this Section 5.7(c) and, if the Company elects to
purchase such a policy Parent and the Surviving Corporations obligations
under this Section 5.7(c) shall be satisfied so long as Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, cause such policy to be
maintained in effect for a period of six years following the Effective Time
and, with respect to any Legal Action commenced during such period, until the
final disposition of such Legal Action.

 

(d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.7 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

 



 

43 (e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.

Section 5.8 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Law,
each of the parties to this Agreement shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the conditions set forth
in Article VI are satisfied and to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable. The terms of this Section 5.8 shall not limit the rights of the
Company set forth in Section 5.4.

Section 5.9 _Consents; Filings; Further Action_. 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or
other authorizations and make any filings and notifications required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
thereafter make any other submissions either required or deemed appropriate by
either Parent or the Company in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the HSR Act, the DGCL and any other applicable Law. Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings and notifications, including by
providing copies of all relevant documents to each non-filing party and its
advisors before filing. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall
consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period
or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental
Authority without the prior written consent of each other party to this
Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and
in any event no later than 10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
each of Parent and the Company shall file any Notification and Report Forms
and related material required to be filed by it with the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall promptly make any further filings pursuant thereto that
may be necessary, proper or advisable.

 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than 10
Business Days for all necessary applications and other related filings for



 

44  obtaining any consent or Permit or 20 Business Days for all necessary
notifications not involving any consent or Permit) after the date of this
Agreement, the parties shall prepare and file all necessary applications,
notifications and related filings for obtaining all consents and Permits set
forth on Section 36(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter from the FCC and State
PUCs (the " _Required Telecommunications Consents_ "). Each party shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, provide each other party with all
information necessary for the preparation of such applications, notifications
and filings on a timely basis, including those portions of such applications,
notifications and filings which are required to be completed by each party.
Without limitation to the generality of Sections 5.8 and 5.9(a), subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties shall
use reasonable best efforts to prosecute applications made with the FCC and
State PUCs with due diligence before the FCC and the State PUCs and, in
connection therewith, take such actions as may be necessary or reasonably
required in connection with such applications, including the furnishing to
the FCC and the State PUCs any documents, materials, or other information
requested by the FCC and the State PUCs in order to obtain the Required
Telecommunications Consents as expeditiously as reasonably practicable. No
party shall, without the prior written consent of each other party, take, or
fail to take, any action if the intent of such action or failure to act is to
cause or materially increase the probability of the FCC or any State PUC not
to grant approval of any FCC application or of any State PUC application or
materially delay any such approval. If there are any petitions for
reconsideration, appeals or similar filings made seeking to overturn the grant
of any Required Telecommunications Consent, or if the FCC or a State PUC
seeks to reconsider such grant on its own motion, then the parties shall each
use reasonable best efforts to defend the applicable grants against such
actions.

 

(d) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly inform each
other party upon receipt of any communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If Parent or the Company (or any of their respective Affiliates)
receives a request for additional information from any Governmental Authority
that is related to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause
to be made, to the extent practicable and after consultation with each
other party, an appropriate response to such request. Parent shall advise the
Company, as promptly as reasonably practicable, of any understandings,
undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which Parent proposes to make or
enter into with any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Law.

 

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements about this Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the Company shall issue any
such

 



 

45  press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except to the extent required by applicable Law, in which case that party
shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before
issuing any such release or making any such public statement.

Section 5.11  _Deregistration_. Parent shall cause the Company Common Stock
to be deregistered under the Exchange Act at or as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.12 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in
this Agreement, whether or not the Merger are consummated, all expenses
(including those payable to Representatives) incurred by any party to this
Agreement or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Expenses_ ")
shall be paid by the party incurring those Expenses; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, all filing or
similar fees relating to (a) the filing of the Information Statement with the
SEC and the mailing of the Information Statement, (b) the filing of any
Notification and Report Forms and related materials under the HSR Act and (c)
the Required Telecommunications Consent shall be borne solely by Parent and
Merger Sub.

Section 5.13 _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, each of
Parent, the Company and their respective boards of directors shall use
reasonable best efforts (a) to ensure that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, as the case
may be, and (b) to otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
takeover statute.

Section 5.14 _Financing_. If Parent determines to seek any financing
in connection with the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Financing_ "), the Company shall, at Parents sole cost and
expense, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in its efforts
to consummate the Financing. Such reasonable best efforts shall include, to
the extent reasonably requested by Parent and at Parents sole cost and
expense, (a) providing direct contact between prospective lenders and the
officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) providing
assistance in preparation of confidential information memoranda, preliminary
offering memoranda, financial information and other materials to be used in
connection with obtaining the Financing, (c) cooperation with the marketing
efforts of Parent and its financing sources for such financing, including
participation in management presentation sessions, "road shows" and sessions
with rating agencies, (d) providing assistance in obtaining any consents of
third parties necessary in connection with the Financing, (e) providing
assistance in extinguishing existing indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and releasing Liens securing such indebtedness, in each case to
take effect at the Effective Time, (f) cooperation with respect to matters
relating to pledges of collateral to take effect at the Effective Time in
connection with the Financing, (g) assisting Parent



 

46  in obtaining legal opinions to be delivered in connection with the
Financing, (h) assisting Parent in securing the cooperation of the independent
accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including with respect to
the delivery of accountants comfort letters, and (i) providing the financial
information necessary for the satisfaction of the obligations and conditions
of the Financing within the time periods required thereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to take any such action to
the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Representatives
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any financing
documents and any materials that are to be presented during any meetings
conducted in connection with the Financing, and Parent shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its Representatives. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required, under the provisions of this Section 5.14
or otherwise in connection with the Financing (x) to pay any commitment or
other similar fee prior to the Effective Time that is not advanced or
substantially simultaneously reimbursed by Parent or (y) to incur any out-of-
pocket expense unless such expense is advanced or substantially
simultaneously reimbursed by Parent. Nothing contained in this Section 5.14 or
otherwise shall require the Company to be an issuer or other obligor with
respect to the Financing prior to the Closing. All material, non-public
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to Parent,
Merger Sub or their Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.14 shall be
kept confidential by them in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement
except for disclosure to potential lenders as required in connection with the
Financing subject to customary confidentiality protections. Parent (and, after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with (1) any action taken by them at the request of Parent
or any Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 5.14 or in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing or any alternative financing that Parent may
raise in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (2) any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than information provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

Section 5.15  _FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to the Closing on the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Parent such documents, in form reasonably and
substance acceptable to Parent, as are necessary for purposes of satisfying
Parents obligations under Treas. Reg. Section 1.1445-2(c)(3), executed by
the Company, dated as of the Closing Date, and certifying that an interest in
the Company is not a U.S. real property interest within the meaning of Section
897(c) of the Code. 

Section 5.16 _Adequate Funds_. Between the date hereof and the Effective Time,
Parent and its Subsidiaries shall maintain sufficient cash on hand, together
with availability under credit facilities and committed financing under
customary commitment letters, to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration and
make all other payments in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any amounts necessary
to repay or refinance any outstanding indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (to the extent such repayment or refinancing is necessary) or to
satisfy any other obligations relating thereto.

other jurisdiction. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that
the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 8.14 _Rules of Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. Subject to the introductory language to Articles
III and IV, each party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information
in its respective disclosure letter in a section of such disclosure letter
that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The
fact that any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure letter to this
Agreement shall not constitute an admission by such party that such item is
material, that such item has had or would have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or that the disclosure of such be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

 

Section 8.15 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and
assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of
law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights or Liabilities under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its absolute discretion. Any
purported assignment without such prior written consents shall be void.

 

Section 8.16 _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties to this Agreement shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
or other court as specified in Section 8.5, this being in addition to any
other remedy at law or in equity.



 

61 Section 8.17 _Damages_. The parties acknowledge and agree that Damages or
other recoveries for Liabilities sought by the Company in connection with a
breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub can be based on, or otherwise
take into account, the consideration that is payable to the stockholders of
the Company pursuant to this Agreement or any loss of market value or stock
price of the Company.

Section 8.18 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, as if the signature(s) to each counterpart were
upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall together
constitute the same agreement. Facsimile signatures or signatures received as
a pdf attachment to electronic mail shall be treated as original signatures
for all purposes of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective
when, and only when, each party shall have received a counterpart signed by
all of the other parties.
